['Liam Neeson is the "In and out bandit", robbing banks for years. He hasn\'t been caught, but when he meets the right lady, he decides it\'s time to give himself up; he tries to return the cash, but it doesn\'t go as planned. Co-stars Kate Walsh (probably best known as Doctor Montgomery on Grey\'s Anatomy) as Annie. Can he outwit the dirty FBI agents? He finally comes clean with Annie, but can he work things out before the FBI takes him out? It\'s fun. One of the two films directed by Mark Williams. Story by Steve Allrich and Mark Williams.']
