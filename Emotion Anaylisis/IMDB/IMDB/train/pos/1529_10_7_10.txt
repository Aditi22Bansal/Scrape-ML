["A solid prison escape movie that supplies plenty of suspenseful moments and a fresh escape plan you can easily get behind. I found that it at times had a creative use of cinematography, and the score was suitably disturbing, somewhat similar to Psycho. Daniel Radclifffe really dissapeared into this role too; I was impressed.The film isn't astonishing or anything, but it's a job well done considering it's the first film from the director. Worth the watch if you're looking for some more new releases."]
