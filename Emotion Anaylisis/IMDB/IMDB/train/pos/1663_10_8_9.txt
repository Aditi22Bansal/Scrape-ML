["I watched this movie last night and was inspired by the theme: if you are willing to do something, your dedication will bend the fortune to fall at your feet. This movie is same: dedication, hard work, not to give up, and of course for a good cause. A person's dream to launch a low cost aviation turns true after a lot of turmoils and hiccups.Acting, screenplay, explainations, and continuation were all good and well done. Suirya's acting, by default, was again great.Now, when you create a movie you tend to put some masala, unnecessary churns, villainous events, and emotions; otherwise, how can you showcase it to the audience. The same falls for biopics. I will say for sure that this movie can't be 100% ture, but again, for me what valued most after watching it was inspiration and motivation. And off late, after watching pathetic biopics like Saina, i can definitely say that this one gets my hats off.A must watch."]
