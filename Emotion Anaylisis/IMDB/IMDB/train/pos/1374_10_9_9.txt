['"Without Remorse" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a United States Navy SEAL seeking revenge for the death of his wife. As soon as he starts searching more about it he finds himself into a large conspiracy that will affect everyone\'s lives.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it had some plot twists that made it interesting. The direction which was made by Stefano Sollima, it was very good and he presented very well his main character, his thoughts and his dreams. The interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as John Kelly was very good and he did an excellent job at his part. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jodie Turner-Smith\'s who played as Karen Greer, Guy Pearce\'s who played as Secretary Clay and Jamie Bell\'s who played as Robert Ritter. In conclusion, I have to say that "Without Remorse" is a simple, interesting, action movie that is good to spend your time with, if you have high expectations from it then I advise you to lower them.']
