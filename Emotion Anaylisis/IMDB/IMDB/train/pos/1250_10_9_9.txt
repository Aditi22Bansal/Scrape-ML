['3 out of 5 stars.The Witches is a fantasy thriller about a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Only to learn from her that witches exist. And they hate children. When the boy comes across a witch. Grandmother decides to take boy out on a getaway at a resort. Which conveniently a group of witches are hosting a convention. Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.Cute and fun film for the family. But cheesy cgi and visual effects makes the movie feel cheapily put together. The acting was also decent with the cast ensemble. The story also comes out short with barely anything to mention.']
