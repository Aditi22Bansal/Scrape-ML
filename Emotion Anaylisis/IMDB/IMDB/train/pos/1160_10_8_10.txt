["This is the fifth film in the Purge franchise and a direct sequel to 2016's The Purge: Election Year.This one has ample amount of action but somehow the tension is missing.I still enjoyed it. The sun soaked settings added more fun n it was good to see Josh Lucas aft a long time.I was hoping for an exciting showdown in the end but alas."]
