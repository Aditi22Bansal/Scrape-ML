['If you see the very first one or remember it very well, right from the start you will see the connection. Yes the credits indicate we get the "true"(?) sequel to the original Halloween. And there are so many nice little treats spread throughout the movie (an actress from the first movie reappearing in a different role, but also shots that are almost the same as in the original ... but sometimes there is a twist for the viewers).The original two main actors reprising their roles too (even if some may argue you can\'t tell with Myers because of his mask). This really is a service to fans and a movie that cherishes the original. Of course since the myriads of sequels introduced a lot of stuff, most of which is thrown out the window (no pun intended). One of the primary things being that like in the original, the Killer and the chosen victim are not related. Even so they have a special bond/relationship. So the only movie you need to watch before this, is the Original movie from 1978 - it will be worth your time. The ending of this new one may feel for some like a let down, but it is what it is and even if it feels like a letdown, it still sort of works in the whole picture']
