["I was looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres. Becoming a huge fan of Dave Bautista, The actor so I actually could not wait to see this family friendly picture.\nIt seems almost mandatory that a ex-wrestler needs to star in a family friendly movie , especially if Bautista wants an acting career as big as the Rock (who did Tooth Fairy) John Cena (Who just did Paying with Fire) or dare I say it...Hulk Hogan (Every movie he ever starred in).I won't spoiled the movie for you, because I don't have to. We've all seen this movie so many times that you already know the Spoiler Alert just by watching the trailer.Typical tough-as-nails action hero type being soften by his awkward interaction with a smart aleck little girl (it usually is a girl).I will say that Bautista does bring his own flavor to the formula and despite telling the same jokes over and over again, he's not bland. Plus his chemistry with the little girl is good. Makes it a feel good movie.It's also a fun movie. Lots of laughs and very exciting, just like a wrestling match, so it works that one of the best wrestlers in the biz is the star of it."]
