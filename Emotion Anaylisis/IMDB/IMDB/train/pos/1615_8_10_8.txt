["A mostly formulaic rom com is given a jolt of originality by recasting the Cyrano in this retelling of the Cyrano de Bergerac story as a young Chinese-American woman awakening to the fact that she is a lesbian.This movie is likable and watchable, if not addictively so. Much of it is breezy, while little of it is confidently funny. Some of the jokes land, some don't. But's it's sweet and positive in its messaging, and sweetness and positivity are welcome qualities in entertainment these days, when both are in short supply pretty much everywhere else.Exactly the kind of made-for-Netflix movie you would expect it to be.Grade: B"]
