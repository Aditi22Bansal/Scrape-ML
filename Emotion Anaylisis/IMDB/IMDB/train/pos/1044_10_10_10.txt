['At Christmas, the enigmatic Green Knight arrives at court and challenges all to fight him. If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though.']
