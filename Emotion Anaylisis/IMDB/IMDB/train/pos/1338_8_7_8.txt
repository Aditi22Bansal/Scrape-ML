["Sonic the Hedgehog - 3\nHuh. This movie actually wasn't that bad. Sonic the Hedgehog borrows heavily from other buddy road trip movies we've seen, and some of the characters' decisions don't make sense, but this is a harmless film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Also, my kids really enjoyed it. And seeing has how most video game adaptations are terrible, that makes this film adaptation one of the better ones."]
