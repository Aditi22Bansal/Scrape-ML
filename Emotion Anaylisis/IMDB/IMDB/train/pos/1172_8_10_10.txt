['Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and EmilyÂ´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?"The Invisible Man" is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "O Homem InvisÃ\xadvel" ("The Invisible Man")']
