['This is a film about the infamous Zodiac killer. It starts in 1969 and spans over 2 1/2 hours to 1991, The film centers on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who is obsessed with solving the crime which involves a fellow reporter and numerous police officials. He accuses a number of suspects, each of which lacks for a hand writing or fingerprint match.The film shows a few murders, but is hardly gruesome. The exciting scenes consisted of opening letters from the zodiac and Jake scratching his head. It was a rather boring police drama.There is a cutout of "Dirty Harry" in one of the scenes, a man who got his "zodiac style" killer.Interesting as a history, but not as a crime drama.Parental Guide: no f-bombs, sex, or nudity.']
