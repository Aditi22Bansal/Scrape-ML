['"Rocketman" tells the story of Elton John - it\'s not an actual biography, though. It\'s told in the fantasy setting of a music, using many of his fabulous songs.The timing of events is often inaccurate, songs are used at times before they were written. the story has inaccuracies, but who cares - it\'s not meant to be accurate, it\'s meant to be fun. And it is.Elton tells his story while in rehab, about his cold father, his relationship with his mom and nana, his beginnings playing piano and composing, meeting Bernie Taupin, stardom, lovers, and addictions. One thing not emphasized - Elton supposedly had a warm relationship with his mom\'s second husband, Fred, whom he called "Derf" - but you really don\'t get that impression in the film.Taron Edgerton sings like a dream and makes a terrific Elton. What can I say about the music? I loved every note.Elton John is a brilliant musician. a flamboyant performer, a humanitarian, and an interesting personality. Even if you don\'t get his entire story from "Rocketman," you certainly realize that.']
