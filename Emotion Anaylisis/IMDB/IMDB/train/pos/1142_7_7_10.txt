['If you know your greek you will recognize this tweaked version of a Scarface quote (the 80s Scarface that is in case you have a very well versed film knowledge). Another thing to know: the film features a lot of foul language and a lot of violence. Is there a big story behind it? No this is more about shooting cool stuff, explosions and quotes to take home.As a Greek I sort of almost wanted the villain to succeed. Of course not really because after all he is bad and evil, right? But it was nice to see a Greek bad guy for once - and very well established and sawn into the financial crisis and into general history. And while it is not an actual Greek playing that role (Papadopoulos or Papad..less as he is also called by Sam Jacksons character at one point), Antonio Banderas is not only a great actor who is great, he also learned or knew some Greek words he threw in there for good measure. Always a nice thing to hear that and while it may only be a minor detail, it is something that is much appreciated.Also his history with Salma Hayek makes this almost meta. Not to mention a "cameo" that I wasn\'t aware of, that has a funny scene with Samuel L. Jacksons character ... his voice may be one of the most recognizable ones ever.So this is case of style over substance ... but in a very good way.']
