["We've been saying ever since the purge that Frank Grillo is a star, he should be a lead in a franchise. A BIG franchise. The whole cast was excellent mel gibson is always great. I have to say though my favorite part was hearing the GREATEST band EVER!! BOSTON!!! THE MOST UNDERRATED UNDERAPPRECIATED band of all time!!! Listen to brad Delp's incredible voice, tom Schulz incredible guitar and the most positive music EVER!!! We miss you brad delp!!!!best action movie this year....By far!!"]
