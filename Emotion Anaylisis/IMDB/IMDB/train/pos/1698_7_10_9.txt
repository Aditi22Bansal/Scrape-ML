['Hey, I\'m sorry but I\'ve watched all James Bond movies since the inception of the character first on screen in 1962 in "Dr. No." I have seen all the people who played Bond. Almost all of the time it was either Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. They all were suave, cool guys who might have been tough underneath but were classy and right at home in a tuxedo, and had a great sense of humor.This new guy, Daniel Craig, looks like a thug and acts like one. He\'s about as classy as your average rugby player. Give me a break!Even more alarming, the stuff that made the James Bond movies different than the rest of the spy-action movies over the years were (1) the aforementioned classy hero; (2) a lot of fun gadgets, explained by "Q;" (3) the humor, including all the corny sexual innuendos; (4) a classy boss in \'M\'; here we have Judi Dench as an irritable, foul-mouthed old bag; and (5) the opening credits with the silhouetted naked women. None of that is in here. In other words, this is just another wild, action film with good guys and bad guys. This isn\'t the Bond we have all known for over four decades. Well, I guess all good things come to an end, as they say.']
