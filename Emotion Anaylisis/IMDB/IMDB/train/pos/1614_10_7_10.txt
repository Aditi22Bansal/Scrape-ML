['"The Half of It" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a boy trying to express his feelings to a girl with the help of another girl who is secretly in love with her. Everything becomes even more complicated when all their relationships reviled.I liked this movie because it was very different than the previous romantic movies that I have watched and it had some plot twists that I did not expect. I also believe that the direction which was made by Alice Wu who is also the writer, it was very good and she did a great job on it. The interpretations of both Leah Lewis who played as Ellie Chu and Alexxis Lemire who played as Aster Flores were simply amazing and in addition to the interpretation of Daniel Diemer who played as Paul Munsky which was equally good, made this movie very interesting and fun to watch. Lastly, I have to say that if you want a nice and funny movie to watch then you should definitely watch it.']
