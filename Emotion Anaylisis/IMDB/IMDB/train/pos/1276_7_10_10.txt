['So, here is a pretty fantastic horror movie. I had reservations about watching it because it\'s filmed entirely through Zoom, which felt like an irritating gimmick, but I got used to it pretty quickly and didn\'t even notice it after a while.This could be the newest "Paranormal Activity", or "Blair Witch Project". You know, low budget movie, no-name (but fantastic) actors, get together and make a genuinely scary movie.The fact that it is only an hour long is a strength, as there is barely any extraneous material in the movie.I say check it out.']
