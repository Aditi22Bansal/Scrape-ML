['I guess many Apple viewers were suspecting to see a straightforward, simple and funny comedy, which it isnt. So beware, this movie is only suited for the art house movie fans of subtle character portraits.The good: Bill Murray, Bill Murray, Bill Murray.Any bad? Director Sophia Coppola has got a slowburning and mellow kind of directing, which many apperently find quite a bit boring, judging by the many other negative reviews. I love this particularly slow and mellow directing style though, because it gives the characters in this story room to breath and be real persons. So many comedies are only eager to score with making blunt jokes, but this is more of a subtle melancholic comedy/portrait, with real persons, with real life insecurities. Perhaps better suited for an older, middle aged audience?The story: a portrait of a married woman, stuck in a rut, who is doubting if her husband is having an affair. Her (hilarious) dad, played terrifically by Bill Murray, starts acting like a private investigator, following the whereabouts of her suspiciously acting husband. Did he cheat or didnt he?']
