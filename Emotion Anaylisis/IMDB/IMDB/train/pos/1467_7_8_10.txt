["This is a sanitized adaptation of Jack London's novel. It leaves out some killings. Buck, the wonder dog, is dog-napped and sent to Alaska where he excels and passes from one owner to another although no one ever really owns Buck. The film includes some minor narration. Geared for a young male audience, although anyone can enjoy it. Realistic CG.Jack London was an atheist and a socialist in case you were unaware."]
