["3 astronauts arrive at a space station to find a badly injured, unconscious 'stowaway' on board. The implications of having this additional person on board soon become clear.Whilst there are some really quite exciting parts in this film and a convincing / fascinating take off and docking, this is not your average space thriller. Instead it is a relatively gently insight into how professional people cope in extraordinary circumstances, leading to a pleasant albeit not wholly unpredictable ending. Not at all bad with a solid enough cast, it remains watchable if unremarkable."]
