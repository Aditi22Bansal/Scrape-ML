['The problem with this is you haven\'t the faintest idea as to what the thing is about until so late in the day as to have long since even up... Hugh Jackman ("Nick") runs a sort of laboratory with his pal Thandie Newton ("Watts") that has a big bath into which folks can go an relive their memories for a few hundred bucks a pop. One day, the beautiful "Mae" (Rebecca Ferguson) arrives, into the bath she gets and poor old "Nick" is hooked... From here on in it\'s not quite clear whether we are in the past, the present or the future - was she real, is she real - is he, is any of it - and most importantly - do we give a monkeys? Sadly, his obsession wasn\'t mine - and I lost interest. There are some fun scenes - especially for fans of lethal fish, but for the most part it is a good looking but rather uninteresting story that gives us precious little context at any stage that might enable us to opt into his fixation. Nobody\'s best work.']
