['"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it\'s an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung\'s who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh\'s who played as Ying Nan, Meng\'er Zhang\'s who played as Xialing and Awkwafina\'s who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.']
