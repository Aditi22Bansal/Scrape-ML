['I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because gay Richard from Big Brother 7 was talking about it all the time in the house, and called many of the girls "Plastics" (he was a good housemate). Anyway, basically Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student from Africa, and quite quickly becomes friends with possible-lesbian Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). But soon enough they want her to get to know the crudest, most beautiful and most popular girls in the school, The Plastics, unofficial leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), follower Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). As she gets to know them to tell Janis and Damian their dark secrets, she finds out they have a hate book with every person that has done something they hate them for. Also, Cady falls for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) along the way. There is a lot of back-stabbing and argumentative moments, and I can see why Richard used Plastics as his descriptions, but this isn\'t really one of those great teen or chick flick films, but young girls will probably love it. I guess they are called Plastics because they are pretty much like Barbie dolls, beautiful (almost), naive and compete thickos. Worth watching, at least once!']
