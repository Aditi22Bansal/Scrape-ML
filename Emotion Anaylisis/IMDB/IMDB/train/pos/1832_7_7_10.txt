['Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg, The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston. Nicholson is at his most charismatic over-the-top as mob boss Frank Costello, Damon is fine as Costello\'s informant at police headquarters, DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down. Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon\'s "father" is on the phone. Also compelling is newcomer Vera Farmiga as Damon\'s girlfriend and DiCaprio\'s shrink and lover. Watch also for Anthony Anderson and from 24, James Badge Dale. Well worth seeing for Scorsese enthusiasts.']
