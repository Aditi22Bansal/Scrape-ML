["If you've seen the original, you probably do not need to see this. I had no idea this was a remake when I watched this. But I had a strong feeling of Deja Vu. I was quite glad I had seen the original. Overall the first movie to go a certain place is better than a remake. Rule of the thumb or however the saying goes.This still can be a lot of fun. Yes it is CGI heavy, yes it isn't the best CGI ever and all that. But it can be fun to watch. Unless you are a witch and feel this is misrepresenting your way of life ... ok kidding aside (I hope that is a joke you say? Yes me too), some things may be considered offensive, but you could say similar things about the original too.A fun family film with some shockers in between - maybe not for the very small ones then."]
