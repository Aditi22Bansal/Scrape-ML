['The family man Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is a forty-three year-old architect married with children with the artist Karen Alvarado (Ignacia Allamand). When Karen travels with their children to a house by the beach, Evan stays at home since he is very busy in his work. During the stormy night, two young women knock on his door asking for help since they are lost. Evan invites Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) to come in his comfortable house and asks for a taxi to them. They start a conversation and soon they seduce Evan that has sex with them. On the next morning, Evan finds the girls in the kitchen and realizes that they are deranged punks and they want to punish him for cheating his wife. "Knock Knock" is a film with a moralist and feminist violent story. The plot recalls Michael Haneke\'s "Funny Games" (1997), with the girls trashing Evan\'s house and torturing him. The story forgets Louis and the conclusion is funny when the boy says that daddy gave a party when he sees the house totally destroyed. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Bata Antes de Entrar" ("Knock Before Coming in")']
