['And as you would expect from Pixar, the quality of everything is really good! Be it characters, development, story, jokes, "drawings"/animation and much more. It really hits home (no pun intended) and always is able to touch your heart. While we are now housebound more or less and for the foreseeable future, this was nice to see in a cinema while I could.There are some cliches and some things that are predictable, but the movie builds a world that makes sense in itself and works within the rules it sets for itself. So yes suspension of disbelief, but a coherent one, where you can be sure that no rules it sets up are being broken (at least not in an overtly obvious way).']
