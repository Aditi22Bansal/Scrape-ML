["This movie stars a very fine actor who looks remarkably like the comedian Kevin Hart. In fact, he looks so much like Hart that the producers have tried to pass him off as Hart - no doubt to capitalize on Hart's popularity. I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut. This movie is not always easy to watch. But it is impossible to stop watching.If you don't like Kevin Hart's previous movies - and I didn't care for some of them - watch this. You will be amazed. If you did like his previous movies, watch it as well. You will also be amazed. It's an amazing movie."]
