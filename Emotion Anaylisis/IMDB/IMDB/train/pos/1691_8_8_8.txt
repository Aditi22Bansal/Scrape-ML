["It's 1995 Ohio. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and their 'daughters' Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are a Russian sleeper cell working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). 21 years later after the events of Civil War, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run. She goes for a safe house in Budapest where she runs into Yelena (Florence Pugh).The good part of this movie is introducing the 'family' into the Marvel universe. They are a surprisingly fun group. I was not expecting comedy. As for the plot, it's a standard James Bond plot. It's fine. It's able to fill in some of Natasha's history. It crosses a few items off the Marvel checklist. It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether."]
