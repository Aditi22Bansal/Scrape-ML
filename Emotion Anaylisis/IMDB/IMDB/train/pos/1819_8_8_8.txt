['Ari Aster considers his "Hereditary" more of a family drama than a horror movie. I can see that. It does focus more on grief than on jump scares. It\'s no comparison to "The Shining" in creating terror (but what movie is?).There were certainly a few scenes that shocked me. The downsides are the uneven performances and a few things that look kind of silly. But that dollhouse and a couple of tricks that rival Hitchcock in using non-verbal ways to tell the story make for one fine movie. I hope that Aster makes more movies like this.']
