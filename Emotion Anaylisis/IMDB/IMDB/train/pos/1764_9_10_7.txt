['Many reviewers say you have to watch this movie multiple times to really get it all. No, I won\'t do that. I say a good movie is understandable with one viewing where the viewer is paying attention.This is a relatively simple story, told in a complex manner with lots of special effects and aggressive sound track. Our future civilization has figured a way to interact with the past and now, in our PRESENT they intend to correct a problem we caused them, and if necessary destroy the world as we know it. So the PRESENT day leaders have to prevent that.My wife and I watched it on a 2-disc DVD set from our public library. Much of the dialog is difficult to understand because the actors often fail to enunciate, so I had to turn on subtitles about half-way through. The second DVD is filled with extras.It is a pretty good, entertaining movie, but often very confusing. I would not put it in the top tier of favorite movies. Nolan\'s "Inception" for example is a much better movie.']
