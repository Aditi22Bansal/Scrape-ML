['Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek reprise their characters in this sequel to the action comedy The Hitman\'s Bodyguard (2017). In a rather more convoluted plot that adds Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman to the list of characters, this sequel does not really break any new ground, but does pull together the elements of action comedy in a bit splashier way and incorporates a decent dose of emotional backstories and somewhat more personal intimate scenes that add a nice balance to the action comedy. The threat to the European Union is quite a nice new spin on mass destruction. There are a few places where the movie threatened to become an unintended parody but pulled itself out with experienced acting. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable summer movie that offers a little mental attention to follow the plot and the relaxed luxury to join in the visual and auditory physical action, the light-heartedness, a few poignant moments and come out satisfied if not "exuberantly" and "amazed."']
