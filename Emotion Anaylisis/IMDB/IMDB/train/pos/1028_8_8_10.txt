["Is the red hot case in this movie that i underestimated at all levels before viewing, if you search the wikipedia for relevant information on the true facts you will be impressed how the writers and directors have spun a trully develish endaring parapsychologic gory horror thriller story like taken outta the 1980's best ''thing''ishly made products.What i admire most of all is the use of enerving background music that makes your goosebumps scream '' dont turn your back to it'', and the mix of special effects and brilliantly made scene staging, the use of light and dark, sound effects and bloody gory physical fights that will linger your vegetative nerve system for all its worth and may shake your abundant teratomas back to life, like ripley said,''believe it or not.There are some black holes in the timeline of the story, and some intriscic factors that youll find hard to add up when watching, but i was simply overwhelmed by the scare factor that becomes so dominant all the way from the start.Acting is not the top notch on the hyperbel curvature, but still good enough to make you think ''ive got to see this one more time, at the cinema''. So if your in for shock and awe and a little bit of a mental freakshow, do as the grumpy old man did, view it . A big recommend and still searching for my teratoma."]
