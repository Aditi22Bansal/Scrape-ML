['Watched 3rd time after long gape.This is a best you could ever watch. Dream High untill you reach the Sky. Well Scripted and Executed. Director at her best. Suriya\'s acting is a Life time performance. Just Watch the Cult Classic movie. Its not a one time watchable movie, it has many details.One WORD. "MASTERPIECE".']
