["Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is a mild mannered auditor who works for his father-in-law. He allows a couple of crooks to get away with his watch and the contents of the kitchen table bowl. He is belittled for it. When his daughter mentions her kitty cat bracelet was in the bowl, he goes full John Wick vigilante to find it. He ends up crossing paths with the Russian mafia run by a connected and backed sociopath.While considered an action film, you can't help but laugh at many of the scenes. As well as integrated humor they managed a great classic soundtrack to make you smile. My favorite scene was when the Russian computer girl gets Hutch Mansell's file.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."]
