['"Space Jam: A New Legacy" is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a new version of "Space Jam" of 1996. Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of "Space Jam" I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that "Space Jam: A New Legacy" is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed.']
