['This 2020 thriller stars Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen.\nThis begins with a woman, Diane (Paulson) giving birth to a baby that becomes incubated. Seventeen Years later, Diane is tending to her teenage daughter, Chloe (Allen) who is crippled. Soon, Chloe suspects that she\'s hiding something from her. This is a good, tense thriller that has a "Misery" vibe and both actresses are good in it. I recommend this if you\'re into psychological thrillers.']
