['There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks ("Capt. Krause") is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat "wolf pack" strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too "Battleships" at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written.']
