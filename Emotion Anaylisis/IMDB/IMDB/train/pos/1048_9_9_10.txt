['"Fennell\'s execution puts her female identity at the forefront, not a masculine film masqueraded by a female director holding the rein, like Kathryn Bigelow\'s THE HURT LOCK (2008), PYW basks in many tropes from female-fronted genres, a combo of sororal slasher, silly romance (dancing to tunes of Paris Hilton\'s STARS ARE BLIND in a drug store, noughties pop gems is Fennell\'s blatant manifesto of girl power!) and oddball comedy (Cassie\'s birthday gift from her parents is a modish suitcase), with the appurtenances of Fennell\'s fabulous choices of decor and palette, it is a girlish-looking movie, but its thematics are grave, urgent, important and PYW makes a cogent case of it."read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks']
