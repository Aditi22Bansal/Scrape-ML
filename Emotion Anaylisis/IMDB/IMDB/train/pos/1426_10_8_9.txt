['"Honest Thief" is built around the conceit that bank robber Tom Dolan has found the perfect woman that leads him to renounce the world of crime and turn in the $9 million that he stole as the notorious "In and Out Bandit."The woman is Annie Wilkins whom Tom meets while renting a couple of units to hide his loot at a self-storage site. The best scene in the film was the first encounter of Tom and Annie. The banter was lively and the chemistry apparent. That scene really jump-started the film.Tom\'s noble plan to make a deal with the feds goes awry when a couple of corrupt FBI agents attempt to steal the money, kill their supervisor, and blame the crime on Tom. Yet, like Don Quixote, the intrepid bank robber continues in his quest to make amends and cut a deal.The film was crisply directed with a lively pace and excellent location filming. The love theme was carefully balanced with the action sequences, and the result was a combination of heist film, thriller, and romance. Liam Neeson was outstanding in the role of Tom Dolan. Best supporting actor goes to Tazie the dog.While there may not be anything innovative about the film, the bottom line was that this was an entertaining synthesis of tropes from other action pictures with a standout central character of a thief with a heart.']
