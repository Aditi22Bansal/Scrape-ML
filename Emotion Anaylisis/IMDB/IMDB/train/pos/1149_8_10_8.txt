['After 25 years since Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes appeared together in "Space Jam", another reboot or remake of the franchise was made in "Space Jam: A New Legacy". It stars LeBron James, who tries to chase Michael Jordan in the GOAT (Greatest Of All-Time) conversation, just proves once again that he is not him on and off the court especially with poor acting unlike Jordan,who was clearly having fun in his role in the original.It was apparent the comparisons will be made compared to the first movie released in 1996. While the digital and visual effects are a lot better, it proves once again that LeBron does not have the marketing appeal that Michael has. That is why you see a lot of ads(from LeBron and Warner Bros) implied on the film and focused on it rather on the story it has.Well, this movie was released to capitalize on both stars being the best of their respective generation\'s NBA players. Too bad that this movie proves once again that LeBron is not comparable to Michael even off the court.Take note,I am not even a Jordan fan. Wilt Chamberlain is the true G. O. A. T (Greatest Of All-Time) in NBA History. Hands down. Not LeBron nor Michael.']
