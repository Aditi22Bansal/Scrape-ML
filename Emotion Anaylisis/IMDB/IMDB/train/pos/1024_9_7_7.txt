["James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight."]
