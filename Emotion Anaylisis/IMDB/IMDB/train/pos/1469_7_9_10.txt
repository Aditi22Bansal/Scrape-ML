["Trolls World Tour (2020) is a movie I watched with my daughter as soon as it came out. The storyline involves a larger Trolls universe where you see how other trolls live. One group of trolls, into heavy metal, feel all trolls should live like them and sets out to make that happen. Can our friends from the previous trolls picture stop the invading trolls? This movie is codirected by Walt Dohrn (Trolls) and David P. Smith (The Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed) and contains the voices of Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) and George Clinton (Good Burger). The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10."]
