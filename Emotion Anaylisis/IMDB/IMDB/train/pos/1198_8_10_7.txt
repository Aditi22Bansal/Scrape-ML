['"News of the World" is one touching emotional throwback style of film that can be classified as a historical drama and an adventure journey of hope and discovery. Set five years after the civil war an ex soldier Capt. Kidd(in a good performance from Tom Hanks) now not in battle travels and roams lands and countrysides telling stories and delivering news of happenings all across a still torn country. His life and journey is thrown into a wild card and spin while in his Texas travels he meets an innocent and precious young little lady named Johanna(the charming and wonderful Helena Zengel). The two bond and get to know one another.Along the way this film becomes somewhat of an epic travel journey and adventure like film with the drama of danger as the will to fight for life is ever present for both Capt. Kidd and little Jo(as she has a past connection to the Kiowa people). The story is entertaining as the acting and chemistry of scenes was in top notch form as it shows how travel and journey leads to discovery and new hope as it brings an emotional connection and new life for both of the two central characters. Overall watch if you enjoy historical like dramas.']
