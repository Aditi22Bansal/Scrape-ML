['"No Time to Die" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were LÃ©a Seydoux\'s who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek\'s who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes\' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that "No Time to Die" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it.']
