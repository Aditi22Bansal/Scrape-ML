["Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) is a blue alien refugee on Earth. He's living in secret near the small town of Green Hills. Tom (James Marsden) is the town's friendly sheriff. When Sonic accidentally causes a power outage, the Pentagon calls up evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).The Sonic redesign is good. This is mostly fun. Jim Carrey is very weird which somewhat fits. I like Sonic and I like his chemistry with Marsden. I like the family. It's all somewhat good but nothing great. It doesn't have much of a plot. The last act is not that great. That makes this a good video game movie."]
