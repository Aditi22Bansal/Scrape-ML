["365 Days - B- (Fair)A movie based on series of erotic book trilogy stays true to its source material and gives what is required of it. I have to give to actors; they were truly committed to it. They made the movie enjoyable even with its blatant mindless Stockholm syndrome plot. It gives 100% more satisfaction than the 50 Shades trilogy.Anna Maria Sieklucka is stunning; she reminded me a lot of Turkish renowned female actress Beren Saat from Ask-i Memnu (Forbidden Love). It's a good time-pass for people looking for some Netflix and more Chill!!!"]
