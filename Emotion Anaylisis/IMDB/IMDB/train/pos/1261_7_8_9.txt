['Always was a fan of the cat and mouse duo "Tom and Jerry" so for sure I watched the latest big screen movie, and must say it was really good and entertained as the way the animation mixed with live action and people characters was super great. Set in New York City the big apple the tale involves a wedding(only things get elephant like crazy!) And both the cat and mouse take up shop in the luxury loft elegant hotel and their chases entertain! Wrapped around it all is a young lady and hotel lobby worker Kayla(Chloe Grace Moretz) as all become friends and learn about the ins and outs of life! The music score and scenes are well done as it even has avid fans thinking back to memories of the old classic Hanna Barbera days. In the end things stay the same with the classic chase rivals only it\'s live happily ever after for others. Good tribute and entertaining movie of the classic cat and mouse duo.']
