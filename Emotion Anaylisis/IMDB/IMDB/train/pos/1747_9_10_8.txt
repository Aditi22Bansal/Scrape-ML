['This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders. The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time.']
