["Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times."]
