['A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)\'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series\' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in "Diamonds Are Forever" was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in "Casino Royale", making its appearance in "Spectre" its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than "Quantum of Solace", making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...']
