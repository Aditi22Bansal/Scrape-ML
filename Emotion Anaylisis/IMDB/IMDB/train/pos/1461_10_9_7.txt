['"Project Power" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ex-soldier, a police officer and a teenage dealer trying to stop a group of people from delivering a pill that gives to users unpredictable powers. They have to cooperate and trust each other if they want to succeed.I found this movie interesting but not something amazing or new since there are plenty Sci-Fi movies which have to do with superpowers and a way of gaining those. The interpretations of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Frank and Jamie Foxx who played as Art were good and the combination of them worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Dominique Fishback who played as Robin. All in all, I have to say that "Project Power" is a nice movie to spend your time with but if you are about to watch it, I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed by it.']
