['"In the much coveted role as Mulan, a cool, calm and collected Liu Yifei serviceably passes off as a virtuosic warrior with her well-trained gymnastic prowess (beautifully captured by the tired slo-mo treatment), but as so often she must conceal her comely femininity under a facile mannish comportment, she seems to err on the side of also bottling up Mulan\'s emotions, which leaves any inward outputting border on minimum, and the story of MULAN is actually very emotional (a baptism of fire experience about warfare, self-identity and defiance), but Liu mainly puts on a brave face and plows on without telegraphing much inner fluctuation, that is a major letdown."reading the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks']
