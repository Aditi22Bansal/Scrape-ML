["Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's fort√© lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers."]
