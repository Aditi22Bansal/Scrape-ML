["Dame Kristin Scott Thomas follows in the footsteps of Dame Judith Anderson and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers.Unfortunately Armie Hammer has to follow Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Brett and Charles Dance. Well let's say that unlike Dance who was too old for the role. Hammer is about the age that Oliver was when he played Maxim de Winter.The story is about a lowly young woman (Lily James) who has a whirlwind romance in the south of France with wealthy widower widower Maxim de Winter.When the newly married Mrs de Winter arrives to his ancestral home Manderley. She finds that her naivety is exposed by Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper who was hopelessly devoted to Rebecca, the first Mrs de Winter who died in a tragic boating accident about a year before.It is a beginning of mind games between the two characters while Maxim seems to be haunted himself by Rebecca.Director Ben Wheatley has form with low budget English folk horror films. He also directed Peter Capaldi's feature length debut story of Doctor Who.With the help of a Netflix budget. Wheatley focuses more on the courtship in the South of France. There is a folk song played as the couple travel to Manderley which I thought will lead to an eerie Gothic atmosphere.There is a more lesbian subtext regarding Mrs Danvers and her infatuation with Rebecca.Somehow this is rather old fashioned. It is better than the 1997 ITV mini series but I expected more of Wheatley's own stamp."]
