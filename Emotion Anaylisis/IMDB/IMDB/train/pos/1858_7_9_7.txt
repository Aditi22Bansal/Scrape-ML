['Having seen "Thirteen Ghosts" about four or five times already, I can say that the movie continues to be entertaining when revisited with some years in between. And I simply refuse to refer to the movie as "Thir13en Ghosts"; I am not a hipster having to include numbers in with letters.It is the story and ghost design that makes the movie being fun to watch again and again. The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in "Thirteen Ghosts" are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in "Thirteen Ghosts". Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F. Murray Abraham as Cyrus was just perfectly cast."Thirteen Ghosts" is not a scary movie as per se, but it is worth watching for the story and the special effects.']
