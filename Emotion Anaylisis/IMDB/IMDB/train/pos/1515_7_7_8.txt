["This 2020 horror film stars Sophia Lillis, Sam Leakey and Alice Krige based on the Grimm Fairytale. This dark version of the classic tale tells about teenage girl, Gretel (Lillis) who takes care of her younger brother, Hansel (Leakey). Soon, they stumble onto a mysterious house in the woods where an old woman, Holda (Krige) dwells. She welcomes them and provides plenty of food in exchange for them doing chores, but Gretel discovers that Holda is not whom she seems. This is an eerie flick with a decent cast, some creepy settings and a chilling score. You could give this a view if you're into supernatural horror or scary stories."]
