["How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous."]
