['An old school sit down drama where 4 actors battle it out for who has the best monologue and who can have the best reactions to said monologue? I\'m in. But in all seriousness, there\'s something so impressive about the way Regina King directs this tight "what if?" drama about the possibility that Malcom X, JIm Brown, Muhammed Ali, and Sam Cooke all hung out and discussed life one night. No matter what really happened, this film happened, and it was fantastic.8.4/10.']
