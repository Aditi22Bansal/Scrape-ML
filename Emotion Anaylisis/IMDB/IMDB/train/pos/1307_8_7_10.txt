["GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable."]
