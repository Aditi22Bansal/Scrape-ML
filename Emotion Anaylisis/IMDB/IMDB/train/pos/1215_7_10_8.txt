["First time seeing two different IMAX movies in the same day I got to see Wrath of Man as well that's irrelevant but amazing too. Darren Lynn Bousman continued a beloved horror franchise with new faces I'm proud of Chris Rock being in horror I don't think he's done anything like it! Spiral is just as gruesome as any of the Saw films with a little bit of comedy, dirty cops, and plenty of games to be played. Well worth the money and better than a lot of the sequels."]
