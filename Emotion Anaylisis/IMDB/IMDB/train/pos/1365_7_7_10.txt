["What a beautiful, moving story and film, and acting....I was stunned by this feature, and I realized that it was real good for mental health to discover such gems from time to time. That's unfortunately not the kind of film that audiences in theaters will come to see, at least not the bulk audiences. There is not real love interest here, not as in other films, I mean. This is a so sensitive and poignant story, so unexpected story telling. Thanks Netflix for having released this movie."]
