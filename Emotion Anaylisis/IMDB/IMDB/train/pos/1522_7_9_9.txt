['After Cassius Clay (Eli Goree ) defeats Sonny Liston (Aaron D. Alexander ) he has an after party with Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge ), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr., and no women. Malcolm X is a real party-poop and puts a dampener on everything wanting to talk about how evil white people are, while looking over his shoulder. All of the characters weigh in on the race issue. Cooke and Brown agree it is economic empowerment. Malcolm X draws a hard solid line. You are either for or against. And Ali is all about Ali.The fictional conversations were interesting and most likely more meaningful than the ones they really had that night. Well done.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
