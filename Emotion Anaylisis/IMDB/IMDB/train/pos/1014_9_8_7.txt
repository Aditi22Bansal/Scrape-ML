['The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this "version": the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert\'s books quite a few times, and Lynch\'s Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve\'s Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert\'s fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot.']
