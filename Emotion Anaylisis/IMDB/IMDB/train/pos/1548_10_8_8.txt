['I saw "Wolfwalkers", starring the voices of Honor Kneafsey-the A Christmas Prince movies, Miss You Already; Eva Whittaker-in her first theatrical movie; Sean Bean-Jupiter Ascending, Game of Thrones_tv and Simon McBurney-The Conjuring 2, Mission:Impossible_Rogue Nation.This is an animated movie about an Irish folk tale. In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it\'s not just one long tale-with the other two being \'The Secret of Kells\'_2009 & \'Song of the Sea\'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It\'s rated "PG" for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.']
