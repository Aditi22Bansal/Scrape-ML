['This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who\'s a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn\'t get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from "Iron Man 3", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It\'s a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there\'s two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It\'s still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary "The Problem With Apu" even more idiotic. ***1/2.']
