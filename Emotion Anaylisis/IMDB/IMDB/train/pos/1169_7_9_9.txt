['Emma is a subtle comedy, delving into issues of marriage, sex, age, and social status. It was the last book of hers published while author Jane Austen was still alive. About the character Emma she said, preparing to write the novel, "I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like."Emma is 21 and privileged, she fashions herself as a matchmaker and most of the stories that develop result from this. It truly is a comedy of manners. Not slapstick comedy, the type of subtle British comedy.This movie pretty well follows the novel and Anya Taylor-Joy to me is just perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She is a good actress but I especially love to look at her face, with her wide-set eyes and perfect lips. Strangely after she was selected to play the role she was hesitant, she said she didn\'t think of herself as attractive enough. In fact in an interview she said, "I have never and I don\'t think I will ever think of myself as beautiful. I don\'t think I\'m beautiful enough to be in films."Bill Nighy is very good as her wealthy father Mr. Woodhouse and as often happens when he has a supporting role, Nighy steals every scene he is in.Good movie of a familiar story, I enjoyed it. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.']
