['The Duke (Oscar Isaac) is sent by the empire to take control of the spice operations on Arrakis, which sounds like Iraqis. It is inhospitable and the locals have seen empires come and go who try to rule over them. (Reminded me of Afghanistan.) The Duke wants to have peace. The Duke\'s son Paul (Timoth√©e Chalamet) is the main character and has too much of his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in him. She comes from a long line of witches and he has some of their powers such as "The Voice" and "The Sight" which is similar to "The Force." He dreams of a girl (who doesn\'t?) and of things to come. As it turns out, the empire was quite honest with them.I have never read the book. Three of us watched the first one on VHS and fell asleep during the film. The machines looked like they came out of "Star Wars." They needed some good music background.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.']
