["The film opens with music critics gone bad.May contain plot spoilers as I understand the plot. John David Washington is recruited to save the world from Andrei (Kenneth Branagh ) a Russian oligarch. A secret city in Russia was destroyed and has bomb grade 241 laying about in standardized containers. However, the plot isn't that simple. There is a time travel thing going on. Things move backwards and forwards in time. Both have to happen as not to disturb the entropy. If the algorithm is altered, everything ends. The guy who wants to start WWIII in involved with the time travel.Things were confusing to say the least with too much of the film running backwards to prevent a paradox. Needed to be shorter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."]
