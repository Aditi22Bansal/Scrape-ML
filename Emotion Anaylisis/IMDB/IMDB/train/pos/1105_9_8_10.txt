["Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives in his large London flat for much of his adult life. He's showing signs of dementia as he falsely accuses others of stealing his beloved watch. His caregiver daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him that she's moving to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough. This is an interesting movie with some very interesting actors. Maybe the early part of the movie had me expecting too much. I end up reviewing what's not on the screen rather than what's on it."]
