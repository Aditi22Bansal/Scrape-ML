['A young woman, Cassie, is on a revenge spree, with her victims being male sexual predators. Once a high-achieving medical student she now works in a coffee shop and lives with her parents. Something happened in her past, something that radically changed her life.An interesting and thought-provoking revenge-drama. Ultimately it doesn\'t really go anywhere new, directionally, in terms of the revenge-drama genre but is quite entertaining and the plot does take a few unexpected twists and turns. In addition, there is a fair amount of intrigue as to what happened in Cassie\'s past to cause her to be like this.Writer-director Emerald Fennell tries to make the plot as balanced as possible as it could easily have degenerated into a polarising "all men are bad" scenario. However, this exposes some of the flaws in Cassie\'s thinking and actions, leaving you less than 100% engaged with her: while mostly on her side, on occasion she does seem more a villain than a hero. On the plus side, this adds to the edginess and unpredictably of the plot.']
