['3 out of 5 stars.Shadow in the Cloud is a fair action horror film about Chloe Grace Moretz character hitching a ride on a plane with a few soldiers. Needing to deliver a secret package in her luggage. While in the air they face against some gremlin like creature that is destroying the plane and fighting against other enemies that is attacking them in the air.Mix mash plot with a few cat and mouse fight with WWII air battles. Some horror thrills with a creature destroying there plane. While Chloe is locked in a gun cockpit.The script is cheesy with annoying irritating characters. And the dialogue is boring which makes you lose interest in whats going on.Chloe Grace Moretz is awesome in the role. Taking on an action role. The action is pretty decent and entertaining. It can be cheesy. The visual effects are cheesy too.']
