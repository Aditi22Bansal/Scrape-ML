["If a horror movie visualizes something that otherwise would not and cannot be seen, is it something you like? And I'm not talking monsters in particular. Rather something that Imdb itself reveals almost instantly under the title. Having said that, the visual treatment and the allegories are there and ripe for picking an depicting. Doesn't mean it will float your boat or that youl will like the movie, especially considering the slow pace.Having said all that and with 3 female leads, this can annoy some people for different reasons. It would be a shame though, because if you are in the right mindset, you will be scared, entertained and have some food for thought too. Great performances all along from everyone involved. Try to go with the slow flow to get the most of it"]
