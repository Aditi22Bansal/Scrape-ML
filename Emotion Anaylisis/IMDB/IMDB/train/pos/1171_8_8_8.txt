['I really enjoyed the invisible man, it was a different kind of thriller and it works. Elisabeth moss slayed as the leading lady, developing well throughout the film and delivering a killer ending. The acting was good, the storyline development kept a good pace, and the action scenes awesome. Really enjoyable thriller.']
