["Animation is so well done reminded me of Who Killed Roger Rabbit where the real world is mixed and they interact with the cartoons. Anyway I see why so many highly rated Tom and Jerry it's so lovable, heartwarming when Chloe Grace Moretz character says it's like they've been fighting years. I'm so happy there was more animation than you'd expect that's great for fans! Tim Story is very good at making feel-good films."]
