['A fun and wholesome adventure to discover that sometimes what you always needed was with you all along. The story is a unique take on mythical creatures and magic, pitting ancient sorcery and new age technology. The characters are well developed and the storyline had good flow. Lots of fun and heartfelt moments. Lovely!']
