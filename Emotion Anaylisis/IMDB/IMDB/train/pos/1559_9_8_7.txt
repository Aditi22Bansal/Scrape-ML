['3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.']
