["Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait."]
