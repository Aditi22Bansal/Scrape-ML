["This is the story of Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya ) who lead the Chicago branch. He had one too many bills. It is also the story of Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) the FBI informant who assisted in getting Fred assassinated by the FBI and Chicago Police. The story starts with Fred already as a leader and with Bill getting arrested and becoming an informant.I imagine the role of the traitor was a tough one for LaKeith Stanfield who came through as a reluctant informant. While the film touches on the black struggle, he is not weighed down with being preachy , just letting the facts speak for themselves.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."]
