["If you compare this movie to the original it will feel less unique and may seem more deja vu. Of course it's a a chase movie with zombies. In that sense it has a Terminator feel. Things start off with an interesting premise - go back to get the cash since Zombies don't want money. Some faults. One thing I didn't like was the game where they fed humans to the zombies. Unnecessary. Also making them fight other bad humans was irritating. A lot of the movie is at night.\nThe good points are the ending wasn't irritating. No one likes too much self sacrifice. Kang Dong Won looks quite suitable in this role surprisingly. In the past he seemed not quite hero looking for action but here he is good. Lee Jung Hyun is quite a good heroine too.\nOkay for what it is. More conventional and less unique than the first movie. I prefer #Alive. But still an entertaining enough watch."]
