["If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't). A good job overall, but nothing great in my eyes ..."]
