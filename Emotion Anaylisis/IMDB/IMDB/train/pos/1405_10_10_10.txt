["Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction. She got recruited by her superior Duke (John Malkovich) into the company. To his dismay, she continues to ask her victims questions before she kills them. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is concerned. Ava returns to visit her family after an 8 year absence. Her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) is dating her ex Michael (Common). Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie. It ends up being a B-movie with a lot of talent who are cashing in some cheques."]
