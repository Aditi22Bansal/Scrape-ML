['Directed and written by Eli Roth, KNOCK KNOCK finds a hapless young man named Evan (Keanu Reeves), becoming a random victim of a home-invasion. Instead of a big bad wolf at the door is a couple of stone-cold foxes. The perfect gentleman helps two storm-worn young women into his home only to be tied and tortured. Woefully violated complete with blackmail photos taken of him, Evan is in the middle of a rapid twisting cat-and-mouse orgy of violence. These two hormone charged lasses, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) are not ladies.']
