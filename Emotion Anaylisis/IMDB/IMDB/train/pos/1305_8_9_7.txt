['It\'s curious that this film has been rated 15 - most of the intended audience must surely be younger than that! The premiss is that Blu Hunt ("Danni") wakes up in an institution where she is told that she has mutant powers and is being cared for until she can master them safely. Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams "Rahne" (pronounced rain) but otherwise it\'s a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up. Clearly teed up for a sequel, let\'s hope they spend more time developing their personalities next time.']
