["Estella (Emma Stone) was born with usual black and white hair. Her mother keeps warning her against turning to the evil side known as Cruella. The rebellious young girl lost her mother in a Dalmatian attack. She finds a fashion mentor in The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who turns into her rival and then her oppressor.Disney reworking their villains come with some issues. The obvious one for this character is dogs. It does come up with an interesting solution. Now I don't remember Cruella having dogs herself and that threw me off. Killing off her mother with Dalmatians seems to be overkill. At that point, I was going to murder this movie if it made the Dalmatians into villains and excuses. Quite frankly, non of that is necessary as the solution is very simple and very effective. I would have liked The Baroness to pitch the idea of 101 Dalmatians to Walt Disney but that may be going too far.In the end, this is a very good reworking but it is a lot of road to cover. I was so intrigued with little Estella that she would have been plenty enough for a whole movie herself. It would be an interesting battle between Estella and Cruella. It could have been a Carrie revenge story against her school tormentors. A young Cruella movie may have been a better option."]
