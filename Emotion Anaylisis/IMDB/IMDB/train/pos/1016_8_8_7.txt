['4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.']
