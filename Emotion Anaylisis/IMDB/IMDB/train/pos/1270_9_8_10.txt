["If you're looking for a nice Saturday or Sunday evening entertainment, this is the movie for you. Bollywood actually needs such horror comedies. Saif ,Arjun, Yami, Jacqueline, Javed Jaffee all in one and do their parts well. The atroy itself is fun, with comedy all through. Yes, the climax could've been shortened a bit, but it's ok, I am already looking forward to this been made as a franchise of sorts. It could actually breathe some new life in the tired Bollywood Horror genre, which is none.Full credit to the director too."]
