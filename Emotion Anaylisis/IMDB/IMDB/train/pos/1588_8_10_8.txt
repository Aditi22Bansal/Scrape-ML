["I didn't even know Coppola directed this when I started watching it. I selected it from one of my online subscriptions only because Murray was in it.Twenty minutes into it I was totally uninterested in Dean, Laura's hubby, alleged infidelity and Laura's boring and stressing life as an upper class NewYorker with two young kids.Enters Murray, as Felix, Laura's eccentric father, bringing some sparkles to the stale story. Yes, Felix is a womaniser but he's also charming and sophisticated and basically the only interesting character of the whole movie.Felix forces Laura to go into a private investigation on Dean and the two share some bizarre conversations about the eternal male-female struggle.Half way through, I got a hunch of how this was going to end and caught the bull's eye, so I lost interest because the whole chase is just an excuse to debate trite issues about relationships, with a politically correct twist.On the positive side, the photography is nice, with some beautiful settings but that's all and even Murray cannot save this boring and predictable truckload of cliches.It is now final: Sofia Coppola has nothing left say. She's even started pilfering from Bridget Jones' story line..."]
