["It's definitely derivative and it almost certainly has some issues with the choices it takes in the last 15 minutes, but The Little Things succeeds with tension, atmospheric creepiness, and the performance of Jared Leto. I think we all would have hoped for a little more from the 3 of these leads, but it still contains some fantastic cinematic moments.6.9/10."]
