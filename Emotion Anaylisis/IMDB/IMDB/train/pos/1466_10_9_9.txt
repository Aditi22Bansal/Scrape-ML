['There have been several movies "Call of the Wild" but this is the first time one has told the entire story in Jack London\'s book. The real main character is the big dog, Buck, and his transformation from house pet to sled dog to alpha male of his own hybrid Timberwolf pack.This movie in its form could not have been made with real dogs. Instead they used state of the art motion capture to generate realistic animation for the animals. This is covered quite nicely in a series of "making of" extras on the movie disc.Harrison Ford, almost 80 now, is very effective as the narrator and the old prospector that befriends Buck. This is a really good movie, at first the sight of an animated Buck threw me off but soon it made no difference, the story is so good.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.']
