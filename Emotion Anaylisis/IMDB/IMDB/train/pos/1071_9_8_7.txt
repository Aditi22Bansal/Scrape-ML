['I had never heard of the Jungle Cruise ride until I heard of this movie, and that Disneyland was removing racist caricatures from the ride (well, they kinda have to at this point).As for the movie "Jungle Cruise", it was what I expected. Lots of action reminiscent of every adventure movie of the past forty years, and no shortage of CGI. Very much a summer movie. Sure to entertain the tykes.']
