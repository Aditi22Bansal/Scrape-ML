['Generally Regarded as one of the Better Horror Movies of Recent Years.It\'s one that Slow-Burns and Creeps Under Your Skin and into Your Head.Debut Movie for Writer/Director Ari Aster (followed by "Midsommar" (2020).The Film is Highlighted by some Incredible Camera Work and a Bravura Performance from Toni Collette.The Other Actors Deliver Riveting Roles that are Demanding and Essential to the Power of this Haunting and Harrowing Movie.Not Without some Issues, like the Over Two Hour Running Time that is Pushing the Limits of such a Nerve-Racking Template to the Extreme.The Ending can Alienate some Viewers with a Cultish Trope that can be Over-the-Top or Downright Bizarre.There is No Doubt that this is a most Unsettling Film.It is Not an Easy Watch, it\'s Presented with Painstaking Images with a Rhythm and Style at a Pondering Pace .Viewers with Patience will be Rewarded while others may Head for the Exits.Not for Everyone .If Cerebral Horror with a Slow-Burn is what You Seek, Look No Further.This is a Well Crafted Exploration of Generational Dysfunction with an Infection of Supernatural Evil.']
