["While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films."]
