['I went into this movie blind, which definitely made my experience better. I had a good time. It has some cool ideas and concepts that make me think. I was into it throughout. And it has some very creepy and memorable scenes. I was debating between a 6 (good) and a 7 (awesome). Gave it a 6 for now, may change it to a 7 on second viewing (1 viewing, 7/26/2021)']
