["Happy couple Stewart and Davis go to Davis' parents for Christmas which is full of tradition, snobbery, family disagreements, old lovers and the father trying to get the nomination for Mayor. The real issue though is that Davis tells Stewart before they arrive that she hasn't told her parents she's gay, so Stewart reluctantly has to pretend to be her hetrosexual flat mate.As a drama about being yourself and understanding everyone's trial of life it works quite well. It is though supposed to be a comedy as well with Stewart and catty mum, Steenburgen both on good form. The comedy though switches off half way through and it all becomes pure drama, missing a number of opportunities. A well made festive drama with good performances all around, it's just that the balance is rather off kilter."]
