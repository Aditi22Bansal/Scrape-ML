['Parody of the "Scream" series and the "I Know What You Did..." series. A bunch of teens accidentally kill a man one night and dump the body and agree to never tell anyone. A year later they get notes telling them that someone knows what they did last summer. This is all a copy of the first "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and throws in some very funny parodies of sequences from the movie pointing out all the stupidity and inconsistent plot lines. However there\'s also a killer wandering around dressed just like the killer from the "Scream" movies and we get parodies from those movies too.The jokes are sometimes VERY crude and not all of them work but, as a horror fan, I found this movie hilarious. I got every reference and plot point they were making fun of it and the movie keeps moving full tilt throwing out jokes left and right. The plot doesn\'t make a lot of sense but neither did the original movies. The cast are as good as they can be saying their lines with completely straight faces and enjoying themselves. There\'s also quite a bit of nudity in here--all male! Well worth seeing--especially for horror fans.']
