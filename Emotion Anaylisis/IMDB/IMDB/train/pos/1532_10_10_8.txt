["It can be way too pretentious and theatrical at times but Malcolm & Marie is still a really good drama that's funny, stylish and extremely intimate with some insightful things to say about the film industry. John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible with fantastic chemistry. Sam Levinson's direction is really good, it's beautifully filmed and well paced. The black and white aesthetic choice really works and the soundtrack is excellent."]
