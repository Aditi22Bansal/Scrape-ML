["The new Netflix Romantic comedy started so awfully (first 5 mins) that I wanted to turn it off, but for some reason I persevered and I'm happy I did. The piot is fairly original, the two lead actors work well together, it made me laugh and in general it had a good feel to it. A thumbs up from me."]
