['Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ex-TV cowboy with a waning career. His go-fer buddy and stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has fallen on worse times, but life still goes on in 1969. They live near the Roman Polanski residence with the Manson family lurking in the background. History tells us what happens. The only question is how will Quentin Tarantino present it.I liked how the film captured the stars. You can tell whom they were even without their name being mentioned or they have a credit, such as the woman with the Joey Heatherton hair at the Playboy Mansion. Damon Herriman was not convincing as Charlie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity']
