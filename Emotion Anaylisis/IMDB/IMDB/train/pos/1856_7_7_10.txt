['A deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer (John Gallagher) appears at her window.Stephen King tweeted about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, "How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix." Now, I don\'t necessarily always agree with King. He\'s a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn\'t mean taste can\'t vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as "Halloween" (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with "Wait Until Dark" is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like "Wait Until Dark" being a radio drama.For "Hush", we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a "Buffy" reference or what?']
