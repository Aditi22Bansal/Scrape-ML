['Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in San Francisco. Katy refers to herself as "the Asian Jeff Gordon." After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng\'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death. If you love what Marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after Thanos, then this is must see.']
