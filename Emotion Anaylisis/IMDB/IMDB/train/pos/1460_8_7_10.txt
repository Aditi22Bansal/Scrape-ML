["Yet another spin on superheros, 'Project Power (2020)' posits a world in which a new drug allows users to unleash their inner power - whatever it may be - for five minutes a pop. It's an interesting premise that, essentially, takes a traditional action-thriller and sprinkles some of the oh-so-popular superhero genre on top. It may sound cynical, but it doesn't feel it. It's generally an enjoyable time, despite its uneven tone and somewhat vague plot. It also has a few stand-out set-pieces which are approached in rather unique ways, such a hectic fight sequence that's only seen from inside a giant tank. The leads all do a good job with the material - though, Gordon-Levitt seems to think he's in a comedy - and the pacing is always tight enough to maintain engagement. It isn't going to get you thinking - in fact, you'll probably notice some plot problems if you do - but it should keep you entertained. 7/10"]
