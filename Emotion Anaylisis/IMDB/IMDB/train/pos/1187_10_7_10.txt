["Been meaning to watch Freaky for awhile being horror is my favorite genre, love the cast and the director glad it came on HBO! This movie is so much fun and refreshing. The story is very enjoyable where it's a horror version of Freaky Friday with touches of comedy mashed in. The Butchers mask is so awesome/cool looking which is another great aspect about the director kinda like Happy Death Day was very original at least with the mask. Kathryn Newton is perfect I love her in nearly anything! Thanks for appreciating my review to those that have!"]
