['Mads Mikkelsen is a Special Forces guy who returns home to Denmark after his wife is killed in a train accident. Two computer geeks meet up with a third and visit the very angry but not grieving widower. His teenage daughter is not dealing with the situation well either. Riders of Justice becomes a cross between Death Wish(with much better acting) and Boondock Saints. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Mads is perfect and the supporting cast superb with a surprisingly sarcastic script to accompany the necessary bloody violence. Trust me on Riders. It is one of my top three films of 2020.']
