['Tina Fey of \'Saturday Night Live\' fame writes the screenplay for this very entertaining teen comedy. Cady Heron(Lindsay Lohan)was raised in Africa by her zoologist parents and is thrust into public high school for the first time and must adjust to the whims, deceit and snobbishness of a girl clique known as The Plastics, that gravitates around Regina George(Rachel McAdams). She finds herself being asked to infiltrate the group in order to sabotage the most feared girls in the school. She makes a critical mistake of falling for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend(Jonathan Bennett). A \'Burn Book\' containing vicious rumors and harmful truths written by The Plastics causes chaos throughout the "girl world" of this upper middle class high school. Its girl against girl and friend against friend. Who can they trust? Cady goes from \'Africa girl\' newcomer to \'plastic\' to most disliked to most popular girl in school.Fey plays math teacher Ms. Norbury and a couple of her \'Saturday Night Live\' cast mates also have roles: Tim Meadows is Mr. Duvall and Ana Gasteyer plays Cady\'s mom. Others in this quirky comedy are: Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried and Amy Poehler. MEAN GIRLS is a fun movie to watch...I guess because girls will be girls. If you haven\'t fallen in love with Lindsay Lohan yet...you will soon.']
