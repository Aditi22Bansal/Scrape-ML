["Gal Gadot returns perhaps the longest legs on the screen back into view. Why do they look sexy in the slit dress and like a tomboy in her costume? Chris Pine, her dead boyfriend also returns as I guess the Star Trek residuals are fading out. We are introduced to the invisible aircraft. A wish crystal is discovered and falls into the wrong hands. I liked the character played by Kristen Wiig. The opening of Diana as a child was great, but didn't tie into the overall film that well, and yes it is supposed to. The script was generic fluff and I still don't know what she did during WWII. Nice end cameo by Linda Carter. Does that means she is going to be in future films? The end speech by Diana was such a bore, I was wishing for the world to end."]
