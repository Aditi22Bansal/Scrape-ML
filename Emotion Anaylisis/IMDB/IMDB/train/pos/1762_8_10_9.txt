["It's high school senior year for Bianca (Mae Whitman), and her best friends hot sweet Jess (Skyler Samuels) and hot Latina Casey (Bianca A. Santos). Wesley (Robbie Amell) is her childhood friend, neighbor and man-whore jock. At a party, he tells her that she's Jess and Casey's DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). This throws her into a tailspin. Madison (Bella Thorne) is the class mean girl. Bianca has a crush on Toby but she has trouble talking to him.This conventional teen comedy has a couple of things going for it. Whitman is adorable and believable at being overlooked. Amell plays the jock without being mean-spirited. The 'kids' are mostly in their 20s. With likable Whitman and Amell, the movie is able to maneuver the standard plot without crashing. That's not to say there aren't a couple of awkward moments. Bianca's fantasy scenes do get repetitive and one of them last too long. It's a gimmick that loses its effectiveness. The movie doesn't work all the time but it works enough. It's not quite 'Mean Girls'. The writing isn't as sharp. It probably needs a great comedic writer to add more of the better material."]
