["Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it."]
