["Sacha Baron Cohen doesn't seem to have been in a rush to make a sequel to his hit 2006 movie, but when he got around to it he created a crazed masterpiece. Once again a Kazakhstan filmmaker comes to the United States and a very bizarre culture clash ensued. Once again the fictional story is furthered by people tricked into thinking they are involved in something other than a Cohen film.This time around Borat is joined by his daughter, Tutar, played by Maria Bakalova with the same mad, fearless verve as Cohen. They both start the movie believing that women are useless animals who should be kept in cages, but exposure to America gives Tutar an interesting story arc. Along the way we meet debutantes, conspiracy theorists, and a mix of lovely and awful people (who are sometimes the same people!).The movie is hilarious and utterly insane. Check it out!"]
