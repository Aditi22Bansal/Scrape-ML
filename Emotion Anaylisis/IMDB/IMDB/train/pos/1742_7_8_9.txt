['This film tells the story of a young man who is hungry for success in Wall Street. He becomes a top trader with his remarkable sales and leadership skills. He soon indulges in the world of sex, drugs and luxury that few can dream of.I was hesitant to watch "The Wolf of Wall Street" at first because of its length. It\'s quite amazing that three hours went by and it did not even feel like three hours. The story is engaging and fuelled with adrenaline. I am very impressed by how well Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character manage to motivate his staff to become successful Wall Street elites. His high energy speeches are quite amazing, and I really feel that energy and passion. The shenanigans that the elites are up to are eye opening and entertaining, as one might have expected better behaviour! An added bonus is that there is much eye candy for everybody (yes, literally everybody). I enjoyed watching "The Wolf of Wall Street", as it has got a great plot relevant to the times, and entertaining scenes.']
