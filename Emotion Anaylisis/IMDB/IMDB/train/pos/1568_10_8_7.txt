["Man, this movie is as scary and compelling as could be. In a display of the utter helplessness of the people who get caught in the middle of political warfare, Quo Vadis, Aida? Presents the despair and determination of one woman's struggle to keep her family safe by any means necessary.It's a heartbreaking movie, truly... And one that makes us appreciate the freedom from conflict and war we enjoy. Because the moment war is something you have to worry about, then you know your life is as disposable as the others to those in charge."]
