['How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It\'s a relatively straightforward story of an hunter "Goodfellowe" who, along with his young daughter "Robyn" (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young "Mebh" (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young "Robyn" and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who\'s angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live...']
