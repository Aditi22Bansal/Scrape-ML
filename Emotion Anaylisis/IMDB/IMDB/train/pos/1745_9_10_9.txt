["This film tells how the Joker comes to be the villain he is. The problem is that it is so effective and compelling, that I really empathise with the Joker and his horrible life experiences. Batman's father is portrayed as the villain, and the Joker is the victim. It juxtaposes good and bad. How is the next Batman film going to work, when\nBatman's now the son of the bad guy?"]
