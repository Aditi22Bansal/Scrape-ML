['"Wrath of Man" had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as "H," which is short for Mr. Hill. His real name is Mr. Mace, but the names do not figure in the intensity of the action.The best scenes were those involving a fleet of private armored trucks of the Fortico Company. The opening sequence sets the stage for "H" infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film\'s opening scene. The bereaved dad stoically plots his revenge by piecing together clues about the perpetrators. Led by an operative known as "Sarge" and the trigger-happen Jan, the team, of course, is no match for "H."The secondary characters were well-developed, especially the operative named Bullett. The associate of "H" named Kristy could have been fleshed out more completely. But the film succeeded in delivering good location footage around L. A. and, above all, solid action around armored trucks and millions of dollars in cargo.']
