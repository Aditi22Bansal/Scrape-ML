["I am glad to see that this was actually a Hollywood re-make that improved on something already established, as re-makes tend to be tedious and unnecessary money machines.However, this 2017 remake really upped the game a lot in terms of horror, violence, blood and pure weirdness. They definitely went for a more evil and sinister feel to the movie, and Pennywise shed his family-friendly skin (that he wore in the 1990's version) and draped a cape voven of pure dread.The storyline is much familiar, if you have seen the 1990 edition, but there is so much more added to this 2017 version. It does the novel much more justice.The CGI and special effects are good, and do add a lot of spice to the movie.Pennywise was adequate, although it was a bit difficult taking him serious with those buck teeth and the way he kept pouncing towards the children. The scene where Pennywise was dancing below in the caves was also a bit too comical for my liking.The children were really doing amazing jobs with their characters and roles in this 2017 version.It was definitely worth the wait and the hype. And for once, a Hollywood re-make that didn't turn out to be a questionable re-make spawned only by utter greed, pointlessness and a lack of creative thought."]
