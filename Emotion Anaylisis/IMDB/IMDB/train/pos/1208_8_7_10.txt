['This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill Skarsg√•rd) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don\'t call any of the characters "dude."It nicely develops many characters to give you a feel for the town folks. Most was done by narration, which I normally find annoying and poor substitute for a good scene. That was not the case here. It flowed.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity, mostly in B&W photos.']
