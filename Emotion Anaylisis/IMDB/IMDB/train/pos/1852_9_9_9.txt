['This film is about the romantic relationship between a handsome, high flying drug representative and an attractive young woman with Parkinson\'s disease.It is refreshing to watch "Love and Other Drugs", as it is set in a different background and a different tone compared to other romantic comedies. Jake Gyllenhaal successfully portrays a man with an irresistible charm, complementing Anne Hathaway\'s fragile and sensitive world.The nude scenes is probably the main selling point of the film and the main focus for viewers. This is understandable but is a pity, as it overshadows the deep emotional exchanges and the psychological fluctuations of the characters concerned. I love how the feelings of Jamie and Maggie got juxtaposed after the visit to the Convention for Parkinson\'s disease. Little romantic comedies touches on deeper feelings like this."Love and Other Drugs" is a great romantic comedy with substance and chemistry. I loved it!']
