['Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one\'s home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you\'re in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn\'t a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil\'s Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it\'s about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of "why don\'t they just leave?" Easier said than done, it seems. Oh, and that one masked girl... Holy god.']
