['The banker is a film that starts quality cast,mackie was always actor that was more for comedys and mcu guy,but here he give one very good performance maybe the best i seen him in,samuel l jackson was again enterteining and most fun to watch of all three actors,while hoult maybe overshadowed he still give solid performance,banker isnt special film by any means,it has stories that are been explored before and some of its repiptivnes was tiresome in scenes,but i can also say that this movie was good as its material was,and that is film biggest praise,if you watch you wont get something astonishing but you could still have good time']
