["Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers he has an illegitimate son in Queens who is to be his heir as his daughters can not rule by law. We first see the son (Jermaine Fowler) interviewing for a job with the son of one of the Duke Brothers (Trading Places). I am sure I missed some more homage stuff. Wesley Snipes plays the well dressed choreographed bad guy. The film is a who's who of black entertainment minus a few under contract to Netflix.The production was very funny. It speaks to woman's equality but not preachy and in that regard I wished they had developed the daughter more. The son was not what I expected. They had him as a techno geek and a small time ticket scalper, but neither one was ever used in the film. I would have expected some gut who was a street smart hustler, using those credentials to pass his tests.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity."]
