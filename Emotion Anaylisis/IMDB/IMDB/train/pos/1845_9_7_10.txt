['A pop culture phenomenon, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is unlike anything that you\'ve ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn\'t any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien\'s novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I\'ve never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history\'s most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.']
