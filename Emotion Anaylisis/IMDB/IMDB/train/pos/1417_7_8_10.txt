["I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't."]
