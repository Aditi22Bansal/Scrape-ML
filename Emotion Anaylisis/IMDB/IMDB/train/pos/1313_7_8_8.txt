['Honestly, if all hijacking-depiction movies/series end this way, They\'d be in big trouble (all characters involved).Nevertheless, a great movie with very good acting by all the cast, full of basic instincts & emotions (especially Elias and Nadja), realistic creatures\' movements, suspenseful score and an amazing flow. Had it not been for some dismal technical/physics big "holes" destroying the logic of events, it would have surpassed many productions out there and would have been one of the truly unique productions in the genre as depicted in that confined space.So, summing it up, a very nice try for that budget, huge effort put in by all the cast and crew (Netflix Europe/Germany section) and above all, 2 hours of thrilling entertainment, nearly glued to your seat.Well done and expect more high-level productions from them, hopefully with bigger allocated budgets.
