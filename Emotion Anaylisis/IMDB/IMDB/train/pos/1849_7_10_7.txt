['this film is the perfect answer. for the memorable scenes. for the impeccable way of revenge. for the great performances. and for many others small details who are axis of a film who represents just a trip of the viewer in the heart of the director universe. at first sigh - nothing new. or surprising. or unpredictable. at the second - a clock mechanism who remains impressive again and again. because, like each film by him, Django Unchained is a homage to the masters. like each of his films, it is a splendid demonstration of action, irony and the perfect cast. and this does Tarantino to be himself. in each occasion. because it is not only a lesson of cinema. but a travel across the cinematography history. so, nothing special from him.']
