['Co-helmed by the guy who wrote Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out and directed the latter 2, Soul is yet another amazing film. It goes deep, covering the nature of existence, the important of dreams and life, the need to find meaning. It goes funny, with crazy gags that leave you breathless. It goes visually stunning, with remarkable imagery. And the plot is constantly moving and shifting and surprising.Seriously, just watch it.']
