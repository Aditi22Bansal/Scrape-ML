["The fictional biopic goes on the theme of 'women empowerment' and has delivered it quite convincingly. The casting is too good and everyone has given their best performance. The interactions between J and Samuthrakani take the scenes to next level. Dialogues from Karky esp. For Karuna's character is just brilliant. Good entertaining film adaptation!!"]
