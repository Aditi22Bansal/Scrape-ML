["Gunpowder Milkshake is beautiful, I crave the amazing cinematography and to top it off the action is awesomeness! Girl power movies are usually so damn good I'd say 65% of the time. The music is god tier throughout I really like it! Karen Gillian is perfect as a professional killer. I don't use Netflix as much as most but I wish I saw this sooner."]
