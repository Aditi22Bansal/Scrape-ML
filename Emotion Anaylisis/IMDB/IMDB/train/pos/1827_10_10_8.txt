["This is Pierce Brosnan's fourth stint as James Bond and probably the best Bond flick in long time. This loud, action-packed adventure has 007 taking on an enigmatic agent (Halle Berry)to help take on a madman with a satellite-laser weapon. An ego troubled diamond broker; a power hungered North Korean terrorist; an ice fortress and a world as we know it to protect...gorgeous girls, fascinating gadgets and beautiful locations equal a top shelf Bond movie. Also in the cast are: Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Michael Madsen and a cameo by Madonna who also sings the theme song. Maybe a little long, but this is fun and James Bond."]
