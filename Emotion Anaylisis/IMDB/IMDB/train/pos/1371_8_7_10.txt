["Former lawman George Blackledge (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) suffer a great loss when their son die in an accident. Their daughter-in-law Lorna, with their grandson Jimmy, remarries to Donnie Weboy. The couple leaves town without telling the Blackledges. Margaret is desperate to find them. The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women."]
