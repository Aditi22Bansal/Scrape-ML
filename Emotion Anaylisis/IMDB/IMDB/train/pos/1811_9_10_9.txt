["Thank you Michael Dougherty for writing and directing this treat that mixes a bit of suspense with gory goodness. A blend of several little Halloween stories that don't disappoint one bit. Anna Paquin plays a young college virgin that goes off to a party as Little Red Riding Hood looking for just the right guy. He finds her. Kind of comical and evil is Dylan Baker as a school principal with a serial killer attitude. I love the scene where he takes his obnoxious son into the basement. A couple returns home and the woman(Leslie Bibb) wants to blow out a jack-o'-lantern and take down the decorations in the front yard earlier than her husband would like. And a group of trick or treaters get more than they want when investigating an old Halloween tale of a school bus and rock quarry. Brian Cox is an old hermit that is visited by a very malice trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.Some very nice graphics and situations. You don't have to watch too close to see how the stories are interwoven. Not overly slice and dice, but just enough believable fright to share. Also in the cast: Samm Todd, Alberto Ghisi, Lauren Lee Smith and Rochelle Aytes."]
