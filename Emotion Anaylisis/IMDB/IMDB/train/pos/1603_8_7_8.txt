["Somehow the first film was under my radar. Elle (Joey King ) spends the entire summer before her senior year in High School having premarital sex with her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi ) before he leaves for Harvard. Elle then spends too much time with Lee (Joel Courtney) which causes drama with Lee's girlfriend, Noah has a hot female friend at Harvard which causes teen angst and Elle has a hot dance partner which upsets Noah. The drama was comical for a guy my age, but I am certain the teen ladies ate it up.Not for me. Let me know when Joey King gets her nose fixed."]
