['Now we\'ve all come across sequels, or remakes - reimaginings or reversionings - and wondered why? Well, this has to be one of the worst in recent times. Eddie Murphy\'s father - the luckiest actor in the film, James Earl Jones, is dying - but before he goes to spend more of his Darth Vader money, he presents his successor with a son he didn\'t know he had, who lives in California. Off he goes to fetch this young man "Lavelle" (Jermaine Fowler) and his larger than life mother "Mary" (Leslie Jones), brings them back to meet his all-female family in his Kingdom of Zamunda and all hell - accompanied by some horrific musical parodies of just about everyone from Gladys Knight to Nile Rodgers, with a bit of John Legend and Prince desecrated too - breaks loose. To be fair to Fowler, he is a good looking lad with some bemused attitudinal charm (particularly at bath-time), and there are some wonderful facial expressions from JEJ as he awaits death/relief from his coffin, but the rest of this just misfires on a pretty much continuous basis. The first film was very much of it\'s time, and that time is well and truly past...']
