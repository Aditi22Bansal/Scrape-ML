['"Luca" is about a race of merpeople??? Luca (Jacob Tremblay) is a young Italian merman/merboy who dreams about life on the surface. His parents, Lorenzo and Daniela Paguro (Jim Gaffigan and Maya Rudolph), however, are deathly afraid of the surface and don\'t want Luca anywhere near it. Luca defies his parents with the help of another merboy named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer). When he gets to the surface he finds that he becomes an air breathing, tail-less, human boy. He enjoys every minute of surface life, but he has to keep his true identity secret if he wants to stay safe from the townsfolk who are afraid of sea monsters.I enjoyed "Luca." I knew the moment would come when he and his friend Alberto was discovered, but it wasn\'t as dark and ominous a moment as I expected. Even with the somber message, "Luca" never got too down and depressing as I\'ve seen some other animations get.']
