['Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water "Kepler" drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity.']
