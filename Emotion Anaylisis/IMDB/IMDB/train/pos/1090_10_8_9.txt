["Don't Breathe 2 didn't need to happen but with the way the first ended I'm happy the story was continued. It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one. Stephen Lang did so great as the blind man that has to deal with a new group of home invaders and a little girl he care-takes. Love or support my thoughts I highly recommend Don't Breathe 2 to horror fans!"]
