['"Escape from Pretoria" will never win any Oscars but this heartfelt, social-conscious thriller, based on a true story and set in a South Africa under Apartheid, is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. As the title tells us, it\'s an escape movie, (obviously), and by their very nature, escape movies usually make for good thrillers and this is no exception. It\'s very exciting while not afraid to show the horrors of the South African prison system at the same time.Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber are the two young white members of the ANC imprisoned for distributing anti-government propoganda and Francis Annan\'s film is about how they escaped from Pretoria Prison. Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It\'s a very compact little movie though it\'s unlikely to cause Bresson\'s "A Man Escaped", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Papillion" cause for concern. That said, this is still edge-of-the-seat stuff, very skillfully done, and the performances throughout are first-rate. In the end, you might just say, it does what it says on the tin.']
