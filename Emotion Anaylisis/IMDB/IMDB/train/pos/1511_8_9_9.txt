['Upfront, I think it\'s fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson "J.D." (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it\'s parts.']
