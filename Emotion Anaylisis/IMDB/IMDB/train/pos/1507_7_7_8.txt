['It is the Hanna Barbera cinematic universe. Already familiar with me, as a kid I used to watch the All Star Laff-A-Lympics cartoons.Made in CGI, you have the origins of how Shaggy met Scooby Doo. They even recreate the original title sequence in CGI.If you are eagle eyed you will spot references to Scooby Doo and other Hanna Barbera carton characters such as a poster of Hong Kong Phooey.More prominent is Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, Captain Caveman, the villain is Dick Dastardly and in due course Muttley makes an appearance.Dastardly is after Scooby Doo who is the last descendant of a dog that belonged to a famous warrior. Dastardly plans to use Scooby Doo to unleash the three headed Cerberus.The fun is Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the Mystery Machine gang. It is updated with plenty of pop cultural references.I thought Blue Falcon was the weak link, the plot was a bit naff but my children enjoyed it.']
