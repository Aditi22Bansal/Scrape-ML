["Have been anticipating this film since Halloween 2018 which I found to be a bit of a let down & lacking, but when I heard of this film, I was hoping for it to be better & boy did I get it!The film continues on the events from the last film directly & sees the whole town of Haddonfeild clubbing together to take down the monster Michael Myers for good!I found the film to be good, ok, not quite as gory, but still pretty damn close to it that's for sure! The violence was pretty epic for what it was & the scares were ace! Yes, there's no focus on a specific character, but hey who cares!? The story is simple also & straight forward, that's not an issue! Moreover is the fact that the film continues on directly after the film & sort clears uyp loose ends & back tracks to 1978 also which was good! The violence & body count are revved up in this sequel & put the 2018 film to shame! The eye candy is good also!Overall it's an ace sequel! Don't listen tot eh haters, watch it for yourself!9/10!"]
