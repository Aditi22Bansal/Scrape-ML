['I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book "The Hunger Games" or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!']
