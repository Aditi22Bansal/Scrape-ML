["Nicolas Cage (Robin) is electrifying in Pig much better than a lot of his oddball roles! I don't think it's much of a thriller except a few parts, more of a drama that is quite impactful on emotions and crystal smooth writing. I'm offended a couple people I talked to thought Pig was a name for someone no it's actually about the animal which was so well filmed in every aspect! I wasn't sure why people were so mean to Robin but he handled it all superbly. I absolutely loved this movie, I highly recommend it to anyone."]
