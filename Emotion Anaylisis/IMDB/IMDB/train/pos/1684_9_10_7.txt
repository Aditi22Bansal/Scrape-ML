['It was a good film. Not the second coming of Christ as many procalime it to be but it was intersting and simply perfect eye candy. Denis Villeneuve truely knows how to make a film visually attractive and he is quite in line with Christopher Nolan in that regard. Also his directing style more and more becomes similiar to that of Nolan although he is a little darker.I never saw the origianl and never had the ambition to do so I cant really compare them but I also dont think they were supposed to be compareable as this is a new interpretation of the source novel.Acting wise it was good. I liked Timothee Chalament who made more out of his character than the screenplay offered him to do. Nice character development. Rebecca Ferguson is always good to see in a majro role. She had some really good moments. Zendaya was a bit one note but very pretty on the eyes. Josh Brolin was kind of wasted although he had a very interesting approach for his character. Oscar Isaac and Jason Marmoa were both good. The best of the supporting cast was undoubtly Javier Bardem.I loved the cinematography and the visual effeets are some of the best of the recent years. Technically it was clearly a masterpiece and I dont think anything will beat it in this regard in 2021.']
