['It times feels like two movies at once, Tom and Jerry stepping out there comfort zone and into the real world, playing off the live action characters, like Chole Grace Moretz and Michael Pena.\nA fun time for anybody is a Tom and Jerry fan, animation was good, not for everybody I mean building a movie around this is not easy, the original Tom and Jerry cartoon is just a series of shorts. so it can not be those two going at it.']
