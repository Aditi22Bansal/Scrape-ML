["I hesitated watching this movie, because the story was so ridiculous and I didnt much like some of the really gross bloody scenes (not suited for below 16!). But half an hour into it, I did get the hang of this violent story and started to like it more...The good: the computer game like action is fantastic and over the top, with some really gruesome scenes that made me look away though (extracting your own teeth!). But all the violence is portrayed in a lighthearted, funny way, just as in a computer game, so I could cope with the gruesome violent scenes. More good: the story (however ridiculous) does have a really nice twist to it, that is rather charming. To top it of, Mel Gibson is back in a great bad guy role, with some cool oneliners and a couple of good jokes. This is simply good old fashioned action fun, with many great looking special effects!Any bad? The leading actor looks like a B-movie hairdresser, without any charisma. But who cares, this is a computer game movie, with only macho fighting stereotypes. It's all about the fun of continuous figthing scenes with a lot of gruesome killings...The story: fight, fight, fight. A man has to relive the same day, every day of his life. And that particular day just happens to be a day in which he gets attacked by dozens of assasins! Will he ever get out of this repeating killing maze?"]
