["Greetings from Lithuania.While with 9 th film in the series they threw all physics and realism out of the window, i would lie if i would say if it wasn't entertaining flick for a boring evening. It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see."]
