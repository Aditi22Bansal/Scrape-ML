["I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn."]
