["It was really nice movie. I can't say that this film is masterclass or masterpiece but it's standing above average,ordinary movies. Plot was interesting to watch and easy to fallow. Acting was on point,high quality. I would like it to be a little bit deeper and maybe had more harsh moments but it didn't disappoint me. The best film of 2021 so far."]
