["Kate(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a hit women living in Tokyo, suddenly realizes that she was poisoned, and has 24 hrs to avenge it, and does not care how many bodies she has to step on to get to the person responsible, but will she before it's too late?Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a pretty good performance as tough hit woman with no mercy, but then shows she also be very vulnerable. The girl Kate teams up with is also great. Woody Harrelson brings his boyish charm as V, Kate's father figure boss. Kills are quite brutal, and fight scenes are quite intense. If you are into that, please give Kate a look."]
