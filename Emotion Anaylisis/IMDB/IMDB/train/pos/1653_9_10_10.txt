["Tone, Script & Story: The story is about brewing romance between couple who have witnessed cancer. First 70 percent highlights the young nature of romance full of masti. The next 30 the emotional side.I have seen the English version as well. The bollywood version fell short of 25 minutes. It created doubt. To add further we even have songs. But then trust me quality was not compromised.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The execution is precise. The couple along with other actors and filming locations look great.Music: The song maskhari is played along twice, the first time it hits the right notes. Second time however it is played when emotions run downside, trying to cheer. Overall even after coming from Rahman music was average.Acting: Sushant stood exception. All others were justified.Final Verdict: A story which promises balanced destiny and maybe a good afterlife if we see the bigger picture accompanied with faith. It's a top notch romance one must not miss."]
