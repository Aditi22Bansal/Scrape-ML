["Undermined by leaving some big questions unanswered and a frustratingly abrupt ending, Stowaway is still a really good sci-fi drama that's emotional, engaging and tense. Anna Kendrick, Toni Collette, Daniel Dae Kim and Shamier Anderson are all incredible with excellent chemistry. Joe Penna's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The visual effects are impressive and the music by Volker Bertelmann is great."]
