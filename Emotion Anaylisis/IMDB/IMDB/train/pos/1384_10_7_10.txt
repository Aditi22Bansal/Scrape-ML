["Genuinely funny, surprisingly heartfelt, and entertaining from beginning-end, Bad Boys For Life has to be one of the biggest surprises of the last few years. There's nothing quite like a throwback buddy-cop film, and Smith & Lawrence have once again proved to us that the franchise should be here to stay. Aside from a Fast & Furious style ridiculous twist and some hit or miss jokes, Bad Boys For Life is a thrilling action film that will surely lead to more sequels, for better or worse.7.7/10"]
