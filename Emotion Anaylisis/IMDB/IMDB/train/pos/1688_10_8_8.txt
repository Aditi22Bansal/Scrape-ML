['This is what do you know? A movie based on an original idea! The premise is that Blue Shirt Guy is an NPC in a video game and comes to realize that he\'s a video game character. He falls in love with a real life person in the game who\'s trying to find evidence that the real life creator of the video game stole his idea from them. The best part is easily the ending, because you find yourself so rooting for this character. Ryan Reynolds is absolutely amazing.The funny thing is that the beginning with more of the action is the weaker half! We get into a ton of great character development as the film goes on and we get a great sense of being in another world. This earned its PG-13 rating and would have been rated R if they had just made the scenes bloodier. I think it\'s better than something like "Ready Player One" because it doesn\'t just rely on pop culture references for jokes. It had a lot more of an original feel to it, which is rare nowadays. Please check out this funny, smart and emotional movie! ***1/2.']
