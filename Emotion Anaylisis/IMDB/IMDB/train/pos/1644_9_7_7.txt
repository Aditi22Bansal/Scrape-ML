['"The Lovebirds" is a Crime - Comedy movie in which we watch a couple getting into a murder mystery by mistake and the are trying to find out who is behind that murder. In the meantime they don\'t know what to do with their relationship because they think that is over.I found this movie interesting and funny, it is a good average movie to spend your time with. It has a simple plot but with some plot twists that makes it very interesting. The direction which was made by Michael Showalter was good with many nice scenes combined with action and comedy. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention Issa Rae\'s interpretation who played as Leilani and she was simply hilarious, and Kumail Nanjiani\'s interpretation who played as Jibran and he was equally good and funny in many moments. Finally, I have to say that "The Lovebirds" is a good, funny and interesting movie to spend your time with.']
