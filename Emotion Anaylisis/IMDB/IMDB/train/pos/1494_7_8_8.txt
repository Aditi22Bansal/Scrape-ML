['Cosmic rays give a few sociopaths superhuman power which is used to disrupt Chicago as if they would notice. Emily (Octavia Spencer ) is a geneticist who develops a method to give normal humans super abilities. Her blue collar friend Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally gets strength leaving Emily with invisibility.This is a popcorn flick. For those who missed the overweight humor of Melissa McCarthy, it is back. Pom Klementieff who played Mantis in "Guardians of the Galaxy" plays the villain Laser. Jason Bateman has a silly role with crab hands. I enjoyed the low brow humor of it all and the 80\'s music.Guide: No F-words, sex or nudity.']
