['I had only seen the first one, but I saw a review of the second one. Yes, it was the Nostalgia Critic who showed me that one. Anyway, this movie features Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter reprising their roles decades after the first movie. That deserves credit by itself. The plot features Bill and Ted saying that at 7:17pm of this night, they have to write the perfect song or else time will be destroyed. They go to themselves in the future when they make the perfect song.Like the first one, this relies mostly on creativity as its strong point. It really seemed like this didn\'t have that much on comedy as the other ones. It\'s still enjoyable, because it gets very creative. I will admit that it did get a little boring at times and even for a movie that\'s an hour and a half, it could have been shorter. The characters (and actors) are still likeable, which is another strong point. I\'m so glad to finally see a new movie released in theaters since "Sonic The Hedgehog: The Movie"! ***']
