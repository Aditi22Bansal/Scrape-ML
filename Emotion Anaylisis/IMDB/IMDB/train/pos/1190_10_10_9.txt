["THE HUNT (2020) *** Betty Gilpin, Hilary Swank, Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Amy Madigan. Part pitch black comedy cum horror film part political satire with a dozen strangers finding themselves being hunted down without any idea why and who among the reasons of a diabolical revenge plot. Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's screenplay has larger aspirations with its pinprickings of every social strata in 'merica however the characters are more or less caricatures and with names like 'yoga pants' obviously not interested in developing their backstories. Gilpin is the wild-card as the shrewd final girl and her battle to the death with the event's villainous Swank is one of the best recent cinematic fights ever. (Dir: Craig Zobel)"]
