["I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills."]
