['Moxie nails it in so many different aspects.Firstly it has a fantastic plot. It is well thought out, well executed, well scripted, and just enjoyable to watch. It will make you angry and frustrated at the world but will ultimately leave you with hope and promise after building to a heartwarming ending. The comedy elements work, the romantic storyline feels relatively authentic by teen movie standards, and the feminist message is well executed and powerful.The characters were all well done. Some were a little over the top and on the nose and I think it would have been interesting to bring in a few more male characters to explore more subtle instances of sexism and micro aggressions, but this is a relatively small criticism all things considered. The cast were all pretty solid, particularly the central performance of Vivian.The direction from Amy Poehler was great, carrying a great tone and style throughout the film. I loved the soundtrack as well which I think always elevates a teen movie a little more.I had a great time watching this film and think it delivered on its purpose very well.Most definitely worth a watch!']
