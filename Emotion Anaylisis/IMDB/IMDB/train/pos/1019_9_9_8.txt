['I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson "Romanoff" character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so "Yelena Belova" sounds like one of Ian Fleming\'s innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil "General Dreykov" (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it\'s escapist nonsense - it\'s not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it\'s a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again.']
