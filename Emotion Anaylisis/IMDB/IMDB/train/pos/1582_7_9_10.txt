['This is one insane Bollywood thriller - you\'ll might love the movie after seeing the unexpected finale. The film is enjoyable to see for its clever use of 135 minutes to blend suspense with sarcastic humour.There are actually three winners in the movie. Apart from Taapsee Pannu\'s powerful performance and Vikrant Massey\'s brilliance, there is Kanika Dhillon\'s writing which is very brilliant.Yes, there are flaws in the script and the story but despite its flaws, "Haseen Dillruba" is a pleasant watch.']
