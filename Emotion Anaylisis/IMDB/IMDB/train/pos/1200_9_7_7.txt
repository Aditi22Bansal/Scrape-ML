["Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told."]
