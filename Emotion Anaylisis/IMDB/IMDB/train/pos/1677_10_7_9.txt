["Aktar is convincing as the rugged henchman turned into a boxer.His moves in the ring are genuine and he never fails to impress with his physical transformation.His talent as a subtle actor makes the already dramatic movie yet more realistic n he naturally blends the violent goon turned into a civilized boxer who is madly in love with his wife.This may be a movie about boxing but I was mostly in awe by the potrayal of the prejudices n biases against a particular community, most filmmakers n actors lacks the courage to show the harsh realities plaguing the diverse n amazing India.The movie has fascinating economic and cultural underpinnings.Director Rakesh Mehra continues to blow us away with his direction. The guy knows how to reinvent genres and do things in new and interesting ways.One repeated effect that I really enjoyed was the way the director handled the boxing choreography.Most of the reviewers who gave negative ratings n reviews are the fascist bigots who all are jealous.I am 101 percent sure that the fascist bigots who gave negative reviews and ratings are jealous cos they don't have good physiques, they have short and flaccid assets."]
