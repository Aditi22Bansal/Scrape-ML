["Well made movie all around. very funny and fun. great pacing and kept me invested throughout.i already said it was very funny, but i need to specifically talk about jim carrey and the pure gold that is every scene he's in. his first scene in the movie had me crying, no exaggeration. it wasn't that hysterical for the rest of his scenes, but when he wasn't hilarious, he was so awesomely over the top. a perfect role for him, and a perfect casting choice since i can't imagine anyone else making such an outlandish character believable. jim carrey, you are the GOAT (1 viewing, 5/10/2020)"]
