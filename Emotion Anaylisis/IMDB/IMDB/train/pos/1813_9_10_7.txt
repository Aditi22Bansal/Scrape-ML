["A fine cast is the inspiration for this 2013 engrossing film where 2 little friends are kidnapped and the extremely distraught father of one of them, Hugh Jackman in a fine performance, tragically goes way beyond what someone should do in this situation with much tragedy resulting.Maria Bello is his distraught wife and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis add to the drama as the other parents. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-nosed detective who is always able to crack cases but is bewildered by this one.Melissa Leo has some scene stealing scenes as the aunt of the accused.The film shows Jackman's deterioration into lunacy as he kidnaps the man he feels responsible for what has occurred. Howard and Davis are reluctant participants and the ending is eerie but purely Alfred Hitchcock-like."]
