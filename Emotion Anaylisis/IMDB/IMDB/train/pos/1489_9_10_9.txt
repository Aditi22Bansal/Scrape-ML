['I can\'t do it any more. Almost every time i watch a netflix movie, it\'s the same feeling: pointless. I am a self-proclaimed movie fiend. I watch hundreds of movies each year. And yet when it comes to having any kind of intrigue, netflix is completely incompetent. How many times can they make a movie fiend ask himself "why am i watching this?"as to this specific piece of netflix garbage. It\'s two parallel stories with some connections, but they\'re not dependent on one another. The characters might be (not really) but the stories are not. With a couple tweaks, each can be told without the other. So rather than feeling like one big story with two parts, it feels like two different movies. Neither of which are the least bit interesting or entertaining.I can\'t understate how boring this movie is. I had to force myself to finish it. They did an awful job of making me care. At all. About anything. Or anyone.The only thing of value here is some cool space shots. The end.I forgot to mention how many things it tried to steal from the GOAT movie Interstellar. Key word tried. For anyone who thinks this movie is good, i implore you to watch Interstellar. You will no longer consider midnight sky a movie (1 viewing, 6/18/2021)']
