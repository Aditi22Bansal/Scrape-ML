["Again, totally blind into this Netflix just been told, watch it, it is good. And so it was.I just came back from Tokyo and it was shot in the district I stayed so I did recognized a few things, like the Godzilla head for example, And Lawson, and the sound of the red lights...memoriesKate is a pure revenge flick, exagerrated as there are so many at this moment. In fact, if you did like Nobody (2021) then you surely are going to like this one. And if you are into Yakuza and martial art, well, this is it.It's brutal, and bloody and messy. There's of course CGI, used for the car chase, also over the top but hey, it's so typical for these flicks.Kate is out there on flix, it's number 3 in my country so it does say a lot.Gore 1,5/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 2,5/5\nStory 2,5/5\nComedy 0/5."]
