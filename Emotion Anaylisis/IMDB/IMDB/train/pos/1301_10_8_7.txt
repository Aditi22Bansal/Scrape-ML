['First off, this movie is subtitled; but don\'t let that make you miss this movie. A Korean family living in California in the 1980s moves to Arkansas for the rich soil. Patriarch of the family Jacob (Steven Yeun) wants more than life to be a farmer. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) and children have experienced culture shock and disappointment as they try to get accustomed with the "hillbilly" form of life..Husband and wife get jobs "sexing" young chickens, because the males are considered worthless. Jacob spends every spare moment trying to grow the biggest garden possible. Be on the watch for Alan S. Kim, who plays young David.Let me stop to not spoil this wonderful film. Beautiful scenery and characters build before your eyes.']
