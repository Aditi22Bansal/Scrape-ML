['Run was a well acted thriller that had some very good psychological chills in it that were able to impress me in a sort of a way.Before watching this film i thought i will witness another cliched horror film with psychological drama that i saw a million times before but i was actually surprised by this film in a good way.Actresses give a very good job expecely Sarah Paulson who was very creeepy in some scenes and in end she did a god job.Kiera Allen is a actress that i dont know much about but she also did a good job.Run was a nice surprise for me and i was happy with it']
