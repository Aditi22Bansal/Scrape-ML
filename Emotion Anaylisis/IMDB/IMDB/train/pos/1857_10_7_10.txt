["this film surprised me in a good way.it's taut,suspenseful and thrilling.it's a bit like the movies Hard Target(jean Claude Van Damm) Surviving the Game(Rutger Hauer,Ice-T),or the classic The Most Dangerous Game(1932).the only difference is this one's on a smaller scale and our main character is deaf.it's unpredictable and I wasn't sure how it would end.as for the acting Kate Siegel(who also co-wrote the film)stars as our heroine Maddie.Maddie is a very sympathetic character and you can't help but root for her.after watching The movie The Invitation(which I found uninspiring and sorely lacking any thing good) just prior to this movie,I was relieved that the nite wasn't a total loss.for me,Hush is an 8/10"]
