["This is actually one of the best teen movies in the past few decades that I can think of.First of all, the screenplay is great. Tina Fey did a great job, she is definitely a great comedian. Besides her we also have many other actors from SNL so it is not surprising that it is so good.The storyline is pretty clever. Of course since it is not documentary but comedy it does exaggerate what high school is like but one still can connect to the issues it presents. And it is full of quotes that are just classic now.The characters are all well done to represent different kind of students and parents. And the main characters have a deeper personality, one starts to understand them and their actions the more one gets to know them.Acting is very good as well. Everyone did a great job. I especially want to mention Rachel McAdams who was Regina, the meanest girl o them all. And she was perfect in this role.There isn't anything bad about this movie that I can think of. It is funny from the very start and throughout the movie."]
