["After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original. I'll just now say we both highly recommend A Quiet Place Part II."]
