['"Da 5 Bloods" is a Drama - Adventure movie in which we watch five veterans returning to Vietnam in order to find and retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader. They will also search for a gold they hid there when they were fighting.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot with plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was very good and I believe that he did a great job on combining some dramatic moments with action. He also did something that I have not watched in any other movie, he kept the same actors to play in some flashbacks without making them look younger, something that I found very interesting and new. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Stormin\' Norman and it was one of his last interpretations. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clarke Peters\' who played as Otis, Delroy Lindo\'s who played as Paul and Isiah Whitlock Jr. who played as Melvin. Finally, I have to say that "Da 5 Bloods" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone could gain something by watching it.']
