['Greetings from Lithuania."Promising Young Woman" (2020) is one of the most daring movies i\'ve seen in some time. This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won\'t forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to "movie" for me. I really liked it, but it wasn\'t like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, "Promising Young Woman" is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise. The more it revealed the more i felt for our main character. Here is a one movie you won\'t forget soon after seeing it.']
