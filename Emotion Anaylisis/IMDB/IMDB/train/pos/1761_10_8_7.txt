["Though both don't give here an usual performance, if you compare with what they did before. Nothing at all. This looks more like a Walter Hill's film than a Ritchie's one. In the style, it is far far closer to EXTREME PREJUDICE than to SNATCH, in terms of narrative grammar. Definitely. At first, I was sooo scared when they talked about a remake of Nicolas Boukrief's LE CONVOYEUR, so scared...Of course it is different, but maybe even better, and I would have never bet a dime on it. So, what a surprise, in this topic, very unusual, where you deal with several groups, several points of views, where Statham, for once since CRAZY JOE, doesn't play Statham, where you have no good vs evil men, everyone is more or less rotten, and no romance either. Yes, it is a damn good remake, I am nearly ashamed to have been angry about this remake before seeing it; but LE CONVOYEUR is an iconic movie for me. The military robbers group is very well shown, with their families, birthday party, with wives and kids, so we feel empathy for themn though they are the Statham's enemies. That's precisely what I love. Yes, yes yes, tha's the first Guy Ritchie film that I love, and unfortunately maybe the last. A terrific crime flick. A lost gem from Australia and made in 1979, MONEY MOVERS, offers also a very close topic, with also a bloody climax taking place in a security complex facility."]
