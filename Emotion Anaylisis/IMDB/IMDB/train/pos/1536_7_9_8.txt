["Yes day is a comedy family drama that shows what it will be like if parents were to allow their kids to have a day where they can't say no anything they ask, well of course there are some exception. This film looks nice, especially the suitably picturesque location work and the photography is never too drab or garish. The acting performance was pretty good; Jennifer Gardner was clearly having fun with her role as a strict yet lively mother of not one but three kids. Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart. It also didn't seem as cheesy or as sappy, or at least it didn't go too far on them, as other family drama films. Although the story is admittedly very predictable and has a lot of cliches, both deliberate choices with both being two things that the film is poking fun at, it for the last two acts is full of energy and charm."]
