["It's rather difficult to review Dil Bechara (My Helpless Heart) in the aftermath but from an objective view, it only manages to engage you with its fabulous music, the lively lead and supporting performances, and the camera work. It is evident that the film was bludgeoned in the editing to make it appropriate but it still retrieves the melodramatic pulp which will make it a much more emotional and touching watch for early millennials. For everyone else, it's touchy-feely with overenthusiastic characters working on a plot that has been said and told numerous times now. But still there's something delightful in Dil Bechara that reignites the magic of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars that the Hollywood adaptation lacked. TN."]
