["I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10."]
