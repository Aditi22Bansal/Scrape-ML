['"The Green Knight" is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch the classic Arthurian legend "The Green Knight". Sir Gawain who is King Arthur\'s reckless nephew starts a quest in order to face the eponymous Green Knight but first he will witness some weird facts on his journey and he will evolve as a person and he will better define his character.I have to admit that I did know the legend of "The Green Knight" before watching this movie. The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury\'s who played as Mother, Sean Harris\' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander\'s who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie\'s potential. To sum up, I have to say that "The Green Knight" is an average movie that failed to reach its high potential of becoming a great movie. Nevertheless, I recommend you to watch it because I believe that you will enjoy it but I suggest you to be patient with it.']
