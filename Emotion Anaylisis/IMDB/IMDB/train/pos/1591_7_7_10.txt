['Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day. I did not think this was Spike Lees best movie. But it was entertaining. I did have issues with how long the movie was. It was overlong and needed some editing to help with the pacing.']
