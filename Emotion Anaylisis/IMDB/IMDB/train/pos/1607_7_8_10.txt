["Inspired by true events The Banker shows how in a not that distant past black people just didn't have the same rights and opportunies as white people. Nowadays there is some progress made even though there are still a lot of people that will judge people just by the color of their skin and that without knowing the person. There always will be people that base their judgement of somebody by the color of their skin, racism is for dumb people and dumb people we will always have. That said this story is worth to be told, and definitely helped in giving everybody, no matter what race or religion you belong to, a chance to have equal opportunities and rights to make money or to live where you want. Great job from Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast, excellent acting from their part. George Nolfi made this movie most enjoyable to watch. The movie deserves a high rating and certainly doesn't deserve negative reviews."]
