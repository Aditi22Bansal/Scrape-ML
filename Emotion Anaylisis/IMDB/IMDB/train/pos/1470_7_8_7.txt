['"I hate to say this but i can say that this one is a little bit better than the first one, i don\'t know why but maybe because this is kinda my thing you know, Rock music, Classic music, Pop music, so i really really enjoyed this, and the weird thing is i got goosebumps like 4 or 5 time, it\'s crazy, i am not expecting that, and of course i really want to hate this sequel because the first one is just a great, beautiful, and fun movie but i can\'t, this is a really good and cool movie, and you know one of the coolest thing in here? Ozzy freakin Osbourne, yes even though he have a little part and dialogue he\'s still very cool here, Trolls World Tour is not a movie or a sequel that everybody can like but it can be great and likeable especially for those who love this kinda thing, highly recommended"']
