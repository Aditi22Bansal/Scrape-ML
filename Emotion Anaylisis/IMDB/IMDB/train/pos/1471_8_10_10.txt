['Since i havent seen the first trolls film i went with this one completly blind i was only hoping that this film will have some cute moments or catchy songs,so did it have it,well i must admit that it did,songs even very famous in our world in film sound different but without disrespect or some hidden messages that arent for this kind of film,i can also say that designs of trolls are very unique an their hairstyles are very colourful and it did give movie a nice dose of said colour and life that breathes fast and engaging,trolls world tour isnt great or very good film it is watchable enterteinmant but it lacks supstance in storytelling to be something more']
