['What is it about subtitles informing us, "Chicken clucking; Chicken squawking". Really helpful!\nFive stars for expressing the theme of female empowerment, and the critical thought that family honor should not determine a young girl\'s future. That equality not servitude should be the norm. That girl\'s should not be molded to be a good wife by having to show obedience, elegance, politeness, poise, gracefulness, and to serve her husband in silence.\nOne star for the poor flying wire scenes & camera edited, not realistic, fight scenes, & Mulan suddenly wearing lots of makeup with flowing hair when she exposes herself as a female. One star for Disney kowtowing to gain Chinese viewers by appeasing Chinese censorship in promoting obedience to the Emperor (Xi Jinping), and his dynasty (the CCP crackdown on individual freedom).']
