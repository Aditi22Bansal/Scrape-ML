["Sure the trailer is misleading it's more of a drama/thriller with a few horror elements so if you want a full on horror this isn't it. Jonelle Mon√°e is magnificent throughout really gives an extraordinary performance! The bulk of the movie is about trying to escape a slavery colony with some mysterious aspects mixed in there.The cinematography is absolutely incredible, would've been nice to see in the theater but at home on Halloween with a 4K TV was good enough and watched with my sister Emily along with our dog Lucas that was all delightful! Quite satisfied with Antebellum the way it plays out and I'd recommend it to anyone that might appreciates the film for what it is!"]
