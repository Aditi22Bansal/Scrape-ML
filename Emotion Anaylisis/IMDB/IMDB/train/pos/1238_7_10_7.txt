["Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work."]
