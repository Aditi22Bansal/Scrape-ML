['I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for "The Ice Road", I must admit that I wasn\'t exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in "The Ice Road" is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn\'t let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller."The Ice Road" was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating "The Ice Road" a six out of ten stars.']
