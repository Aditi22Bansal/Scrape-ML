['Or should i say slainthe, that will sooth the action seekers. its got a vary cliched story, and some very staged and practiced fist fights and shootouts, but it has also got some glorious good twists in some of the fights and battles between the crooked crooks of bad criminals, bad coppers and convicted coppers. this made me actually laugh several times so the entertainment factor is really there.production wise its not a marvel, its a fast shifting ,block jumping charade of theme shifts and camera angles, loads of barking men and also women in nonsense dialouges, some of the lightsetting management and thereoff some of the camerawork are quite amateurish, it wont reack the top of a ten story building, because the elevator doesnt go farther than the 8th floor. the 9 and 10th are for the proffesionals that use their hands feet and head to make the difference in the cinematic world.but by all means its a peerworthy and honest thinks the grumpy old man, the acting are overall good with the stars well replaced by stunters at the most spectacular takes and moves. mr wahlberg is a lucky guy with his pretty common looks and appearances, so there are plenty people to take from to do his moves and cam from behind the back shots.its a recommend and a sequel will come....']
