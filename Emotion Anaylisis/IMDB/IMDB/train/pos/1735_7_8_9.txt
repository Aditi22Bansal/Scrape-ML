['A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He\'s an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients "Lily" (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother "MacGregor" (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you\'d expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It\'s derivative, certainly - it has shades of "The Mummy" (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of "Dead Man\'s Chest" (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd.']
