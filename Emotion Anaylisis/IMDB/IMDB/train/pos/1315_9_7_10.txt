["The last few vampire movies which i enjoyed were 30 Days of Night, Let me In n the low budget Prowl.This one really nailed it.It has ample amount of tension, suspense n brutal mayhem.The scene n the place where they show how the lead character got infected is atmospheric n i hope they show more on the father son story.But alas, the way they ended, left no room for a sequel.Hope at least a prequel.It was good to see Dominic Purcell aft a long time.This one has shades of Red Eye, Liam Neeson's Non-Stop n Snakes on a Plane."]
