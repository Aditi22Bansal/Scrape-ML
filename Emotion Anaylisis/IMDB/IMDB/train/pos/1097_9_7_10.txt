["Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder."]
