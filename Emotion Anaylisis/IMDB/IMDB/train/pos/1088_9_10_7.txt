['Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the "Abbott" family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother "Evelyn" (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children "Regan" (Millicent Simmonds) and "Marcus" (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour "Emmett" (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn\'t have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn\'t enjoy it quite so much as the original, it\'s still a fine piece of cinema.']
