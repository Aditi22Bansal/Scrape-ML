['"Judas and the Black Messiah" feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee\'s "BlackKklansman" from a couple of years ago. But whereas Lee\'s film was angry, funny, and fabulously entertaining, "Judas" is more somber and feels saddled with the burden of being IMPORTANT.Daniel Kaluuya received most of the attention and the Oscar for playing Fred Hampton, leader of the Black Panthers who was assassinated as part of an FBI raid. But it\'s Lakeith Stanfield, as the film\'s titular Judas, who impressed me more. Kaluuya\'s performance consists of a series of loud speeches, but Stanfield is the character with the story arc, a man who must live with his decision to act as an FBI informant. Stanfield was at least nominated along with Kaluuya, but true to Academy form, loud and showy always triumphs over quiet and thoughtful.It\'s a solid bit of movie making, but it\'s lacking something that could have made it a blaze of outrage rather than the tsk tsk tsking history lesson that it is.The end credits song "Fight for You" brought the film a second Oscar, while it scored additional nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.Grade: B+']
