["Very story driven high octane massive budgeted fun time! Free Guy deserves praise it's so heartwarming delightful video game movie that doesn't fail to keep your attention the whole way through. I saw in RPX quality so worth it for this blockbuster type. Free Guy has so many great parts especially more fun for a gamer for the last couple decades if anyone uses PlayStation add UniqueGranule, important note is I have autism! Anyway about the movie more the comedy is spot on and the effects are good enough to not distract your mind from appreciating everything at least I didn't think so. Probably the best aspect is the empowerment of Guy (Ryan Reynolds) throughout.Sorry for my whacky writing if it helps I have autism."]
