["This is one of the best third installments in a series I've ever seen. It was perfect. The right blend of nostalgia and old faces with fresh blood and modern technology. It was jam packed with action, touching moments, and laugh out loud humor. It was indescribably good. Lawrence and Smith have undeniable chemistry and make this movie flow seamlessly. This series was brought beautifully into the year 2020. I can't wait for more."]
