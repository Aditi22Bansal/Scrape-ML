["Sloane (Emma Roberts) hates being stuck at the kids table during another family Christmas. She meets Jackson (Luke Bracey) at a store return line. They both hate being single on the holidays and decide to be each other's Holidate.There are some good rom-com ideas. The meet-cute is good. It's almost a good rom-com. There are issues with the construction. The stakes are never that high since the ending is always inevitable. It's not all one thing and it's not all down to one person. The actors are fine. The filmmaking is functional. The premise has some problems and the writing is just a little bit off."]
