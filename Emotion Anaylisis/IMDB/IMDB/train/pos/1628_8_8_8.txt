['What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han "To All The Boys I\'ve Loved Before". While not as strong as the first movie, this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean\'s romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean\'s) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey\'s wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn\'t delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter\'s relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine\'s tribute!']
