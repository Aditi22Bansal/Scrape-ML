["For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment."]
