['2017\'s The Babysitter remains one of the most unexpectedly entertaining Netflix Originals ever, given that it was co-written and directed by none other than hack-for-hire McG.And while this recently-released sequel doesn\'t match the original\'s inspired level of gory insanity, it is nevertheless a follow-up unafraid to go balls-to-the-wall in the pursuit of knowingly trashy thrills.As much as it\'s a totally "unnecessary" sequel, it arguably justifies its existence through its self-aware, goofy tone, and commitment to splashing the screen with as much ridiculous gore as possible.']
