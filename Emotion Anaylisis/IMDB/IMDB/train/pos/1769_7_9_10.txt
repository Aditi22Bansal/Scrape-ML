["I haven't seen many Zombie movies, but Zombieland (Woody Harrelson) is one that ranks highly. So does Last Train To Busan, a frenetic and emotionally moving addition to the genre. The ending was very emotional, and you never really knew for sure which characters would survive the last stand. The special effects was incredibly impressive, and the acting top form."]
