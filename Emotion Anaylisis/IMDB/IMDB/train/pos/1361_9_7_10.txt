["As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better. But I'm not going to complain, Greyhound was entertaining for me. If you like movies like Das Boot give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed."]
