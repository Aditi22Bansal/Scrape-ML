["What a brilliant story! It is a horror film that keeps a high level of tension, suspense and mystery. It really keeps me having palpitations for minutes so the end of the film. It stands out from the rest of the horror films because it doesn't follow the formula, doesn't require loud noises and doesn't require sudden movements to make you feel scared."]
