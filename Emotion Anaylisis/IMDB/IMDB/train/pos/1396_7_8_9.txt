['Sci-fi is extremely rare in French cinema ,but Netflix lent a helping hand and presto ! An estimable work well acted by reliable Mélanie Laurent.Mélanie\'s fate,in the first part of the movie , may remind you of Ryan Reynolds\' in the excellent "buried "(2010); what does it matter if Reynolds is buried alive in a coffin by a group of Irakis and if Laurent is locked up inside a cryogenic chamber with the highest technology? ;both try to communicate with the outside world , both are more and more anxious because their oxygen is running out ; and voices they get tell them to take it easy ,but actually makes them more terrified by the horrible fate which lies in store for them. Ryan \'s got only a mobile phone ,Laurent has plenty of paraphernalia around her,but most of the time,it backfires against her : "the charitable euthanasia" trick almost verges on black humor .There\'s an unexpected twist halfway through which explains why the heroine is stuck in her chamber,followed by awesome pictures which pack a real wallop .The second part is not as gripping as the first one ,and there is a certain blandness infiltrates the story .But it\'s so rare to see French actors in sci-fi (too bad that Malik Zidi \'s part is so small) that it\'s cause for celebration.']
