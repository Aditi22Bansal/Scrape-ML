["Dani (Florence Pugh) and her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) join a few of his buddies on a trip to a small remote Swedish village for its midsummer festival. Dani needs a distraction from her parent's deaths. This little trip is surreal and a profound distraction. This movie is a different type of scary. And involves a different kind of fear. A bit slow, like having one hand tied...but you are afraid to untie yourself.There is some full nudity and traumatic imagery. For sure worth your investment."]
