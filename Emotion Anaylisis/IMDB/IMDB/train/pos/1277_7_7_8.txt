["Watching a review on YouTube by Double Toasted,I was surprised to hear them mention a code for free 30 days on the streaming service Shudder. Signing up,I decided the film film I'd unlock to view,was one I've heard a lot about under Lockdown.View on the film:Zooming into production during Lockdown, co-writer/(with Gemma Hurley & Jed Shepherd) director Rob Savage displays a inventiveness in creating chills,whilst filming under social distancing, via sudden close-ups on the screen capturing how helpless the others are in being unable to help out.Wisely kept to a lean runtime of under an hour, Savage dials this Found Footage with surprisingly creepy special effects, where the limited bedrooms location gives the moving chairs and shattering glass,a invasion of personal space eerie atmosphere.Making Haley regret her prank on the call, the writers take the major plot point from the interesting Hammer Horror title The Quiet Ones (2014-also reviewed),and wastes it,with little drama coming from the accidental conjuring,instead going for Found Footage jolts and jump-scare crashing sounds, over poor performances across the call,with the cast failing to create the impression of being mates before the call is cut."]
