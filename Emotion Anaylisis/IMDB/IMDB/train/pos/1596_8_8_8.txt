['"The Prom" is a Drama - Musical movie in which we watch two self-obsessed theater stars trying to help a high-school girl going with her girlfriend to the prom. They have to change their behaviors and truly help the girl if they want to change as persons.I liked this movie because it presented very well a serious social topic from different perspectives while it consisted of some sarcastic scenes about celebrities and famous people in general. The interpretations of both Meryl Streep who played as Dee Dee Allen and James Corden who played as Barry Glickman were very good and they both did a very good job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jo Ellen Pellman\'s who played as Emma Nolan and Keegan-Michael Key\'s who played as Principal Tom Hawkins and they were equally good. To sum up, I have to say that "The Prom" was not exactly what I was expecting but I have to admit that was good and I recommend everyone to watch it.']
