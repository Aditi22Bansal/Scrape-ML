['It\'s been quite a while since I felt the Oscar winner for best actor actually turned in the best effort... Well, there is absolutely no doubt here that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on fine form as the elderly gent who is struggling to keep a grip on reality as he suffers from dementia. Coupled with a sparing contribution from Dame Olivia Colman who plays his daughter "Anne" and who is also excellent as the woman trying to juggle her own life with the responsibilities of caring for her father - sometimes lucid, sometimes less so... The performance from Hopkins allows him to build on his substantial stage experience to present us with a deeply thought out portrayal of a man dealing with psychological issues he (and sometimes the audience, too) is largely unaware he has, and he excels. Regrettably, the supporting cast let the film down rather - Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell could have done so much more as actors and with their characters - though, to be fair, their appearances seem to serve as little more than a bit of light relief for the audience from the intensity of Sir Anthony\'s contribution. The extent to which Florian Zeller has referred to any established clinical templates or practices when directing his own play for the big screen doesn\'t matter - this reeks of authenticity and engenders frustration, empathy and sympathy like no film that I have seen for many a year. A must watch, I\'d say...']
