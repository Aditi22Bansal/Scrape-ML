["It's amazing, the Movie too but that in a moment, that People go to see a Tony Scott Film and then complain about the frantic Editing and the constantly moving Camera and the Ultra-Stylish Direction. This IS Tony Scott. It's what made him an always interesting Director. The pulsating rhythm and the flourishes that have now become clich√©d is a Style He helped create.This is one of His best. It is a gritty, bloody, very Violent Movie with an underlying motive for Revenge that few could argue. It is an eye for an eye Story that delivers a fiery Yarn that is a surreal study of Good vs Evil with heavy doses of Religion and Philosophy.It is a finely Acted Movie with Denzel, Dakota, and all, adding to this already engaging roller coaster ride. It is a severely saturated Sangre, especially in the second half. There are Industrial Music Samples counterpointed by the sweet vanilla sounds like Linda Ronstadt and the Soundtrack is just one of the many exciting things that the always playful Director uses to Entertain.This is an Action Fans Film with a Heart and the palpitations never end making this a unique, uncomfortable, yet satisfying Movie that never ceases to display itself as an Artistic Vision of a Real-Life tragedy."]
