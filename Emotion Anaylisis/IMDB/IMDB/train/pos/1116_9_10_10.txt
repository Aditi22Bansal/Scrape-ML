['"Fear Street: 1994" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the first movie of the "Fear Street" franchise, in which we watch a group of teenage friends trying to solve a mystery behind a series of brutal murders that frighten Shadyside for more than 300 years.I enjoyed this movie because it had a very interesting and mysterious plot. The only think that I did not like were the unnecessary jump-scares but thankfully were very few so, they did not ruined the image of the movie. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak was very good and she presented her main characters very well along with their history. In addition to this, she did an excellent job on the way she connected the history of Shadyside with the present time. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Kiana Madeira who played as Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Kate, Olivia Scott Welch who played as Samantha Fraser and Fred Hechinger who played as Simon were very good and their combination as a team worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that "Fear Street: 1994" is a nice horror movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of horror movies.']
