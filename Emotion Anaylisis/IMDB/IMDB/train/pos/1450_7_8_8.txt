["#ALIVE is a South Korean film with a very simplistic and familiar presence - a young man hides out in his apartment during a zombie apocalypse - that some have linked to the French indie THE NIGHT EATS THE WORLD. But then it is a very generic kind of premise that I had the idea of writing myself a decade or so ago. In any case, films like this live or die depending on the execution, and the good news is that #ALIVE is a winner thanks to plenty of hard work on the part of the director, who wrings maximum suspense, humour and action from that premise. It's fast-paced and engaging, saddled with an annoying but realistic lead who grows on you as the story progresses, and a great female supporting character. The zombies are the scary ones you'll remember from TRAIN TO BUSAN and KINGDOM, making this all the more gripping."]
