["Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things."]
