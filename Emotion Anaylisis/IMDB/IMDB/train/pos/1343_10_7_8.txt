["DreamWorks will forever be my favorite studio for now on, Disney showed it's TRUE self during the pandemic didnt release anything we could see in the theater and only caved and released them but on THEIR disney streaming service. I will NEVER go to a disney movie again!! But DreamWorks gave us a phenomenal film it was full of adventure, comedy, had tension incredible animation and above all gave us something to see in the theater. I went twice to the theater and purchased the 3d bluray!! I will buy any DreamWorks bluray that is released and will see every film they release in the theater!!!! THANK YOU DREAMWORKS!!!!!!!!!"]
