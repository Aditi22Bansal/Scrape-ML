['Greetings from Lithuania."Sputnik" (2020) was a very good sci-fi movie. It reminded me heavily of "Alien" and "Arrival". Its like an "Alien" and "Arrival" smashed into one and also set in a different place then usual. The place and time is 1983 and its Soviet Union - setting of sci-fi movie you simply won\'t see anytime soon. And this movie kept my attention during its whole 1 h 50 min. Its not just a "monster" flick - like i said the whole wibe of this movie reminded me heavily of "Arrival" - you kinda feel that there is more to it then it shows. Acting by two leads Oksana Akinshina & Fedor Bondarchuk were amazing in my opinion. Music at the end was haunting and directing of the whole thing was the thing that kept it going.Overall, "Sputnik" is a very good sci-fi / horror gem set in a very unique place and time. It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - "Alien" and "Arrival" - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked "Sputnik" on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb.']
