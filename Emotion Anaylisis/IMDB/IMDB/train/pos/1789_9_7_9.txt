["The movie starts with the arrival of the monsters. Then it proceeds to immediately after the first movie and the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski). Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her three children seek a new refuge. They stumble upon old friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) but he doesn't believe that he has enough supplies for everyone. He wants them out.This is a good sequel and builds upon the first movie. It's filling in both sides of the story and the franchise could continue with more production. The girl continues to be a standout among some great veteran adult actors. I would double-down more with the silence concept. I would strip the foley work to a bare minimum and some of the movie background music. Let the silence haunt this movie. Let's go all natural. That would be my biggest change. The other change is when they find the new sanctuary. They need to locate the target right away. They wouldn't take too long of a break. I would have them wake up from exhaustion and rush around trying to find the target. They could stumble upon the boat while on the search and the movie would end the same way. All in all, this is a very solid sequel to a compelling and unique franchise. I would just steer into the uniqueness of the franchise and go even more quiet."]
