["So, some Pirates of the Caribbean, some Jumanji, some Mummy, some Lara Croft, some Indiana Jones. . . . But . . . I really had fun. Dwayne was Dwayne ;) I think the casting was good. I really enjoyed. Yes I agree, it wasn't a good movie but what did you expect? This is a popcorn movie.7 out of 10."]
