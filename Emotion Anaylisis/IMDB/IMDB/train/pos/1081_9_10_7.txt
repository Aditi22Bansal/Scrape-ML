['I saw "Escape Room:Tournament of Champions", starring Taylor Russell-Words on Bathroom Walls, Lost in Space_tv_2018; Logan Miller-The Walking Dead_tv, The Bling Ring; Deborah Ann Woll-The Punisher_tv, True Blood_tv and Lucy Newman_Williams-London Has Fallen, Everest.This is a sequel to the 2019 minor hit-it cost $9 million and made $150 million-so with numbers like that, there was bound to be a sequel. If you are missing the Saw movies, this should fill the gap. It puts people in escape rooms where they have to solve puzzles to get out and continue along to the next test. Taylor, Logan and Deborah are survivors from the first movie and get roped back into the games. Lucy is a therapist that Taylor is seeing-because of the events in the first movie-that is trying to get Taylor over her fears. Taylor & Logan get on a subway train and the games begin anew. They also find out that 4 other people on the train have been through the games before so that\'s why it\'s called the tournament of champions. The ending leaves room for a sequel-if they make big bucks.It\'s rated "PG-13" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.It\'s a little better than the first one with more elaborate traps-probably because of a bigger budget-but I don\'t think I would buy it on DVD. If you liked the first one, this would be a good rental.']
