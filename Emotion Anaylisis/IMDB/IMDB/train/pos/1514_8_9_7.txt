['. . . (or its singular pronunciation) in her mouth, but that\'s exactly what many of the Haters seem to be doing with GRETEL & HANSEL. The only proper way to see this flick is AFTER you\'ve stayed up too late the night before (that is, when you\'re suffering from not getting enough sleep). That way, as GRETEL & HANSEL unspools and you\'re fighting to stay awake in one of those new, ultra comfortable plush reclining theater chairs, you\'ll be able to empathize perfectly with the challenges facing title heroine "Gretel" throughout this film. Like her, you\'ll be constantly wondering, "Did I just see THAT, or was it only a dream?" Just as a certain type of person used to enjoy those "John Wayne" Westerns with ALL punches pulled, what\'s there NOT to appreciate about a "horror" movie in which EVERY bit of foreshadowing and gore might turn out to be figments of someone\'s dream (either yours, or the film crew\'s)? So as the old witch is slowly incinerated at the end, pinned to the wall of her killing room, who can say that this scene is any more horrible than a piece of wood burning during one of those Yule Log DVDs?']
