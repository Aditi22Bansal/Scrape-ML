["I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."]
