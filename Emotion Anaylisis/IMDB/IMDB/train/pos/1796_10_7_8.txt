["It's 1984 and Diana Prince is working at the Smithsonian in Washington. A new shipment of artefacts has come in, one of which is a seemingly innocuous, not-very-valuable stone. However, failed businessman Max Lord recognises the stone as the Dream Stone, a stone that grants wishes, and quickly steals it and starts abusing its powers. This puts the world in jeopardy.I'm not a fan of super-hero / comic book movies but didn't mind the first Wonder Woman movie so much. It wasn't brilliant but did have more of a plot than most films in the genre and initially limited the fantasy / sci fi nonsense. The film did revert to type towards the end, with a lame plot and superficial CGI-driven action scenes but for the most part it was entertaining.Wonder Woman 1984 follows roughly the same path: decent plot and set-up in the beginning but then unravels and becomes quite superficial and clich√©d towards the end. Gal Gadot's performance in the first film wasn't a problem but here it does set the film back slightly. Maybe there's more dialogue in this one, that's why.Overall: not great, not terrible, entertaining enough."]
