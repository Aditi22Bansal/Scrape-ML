["The Kissing Booth 2 had had plenty of ups and downs. First, Lee and Rachel. Their relationship was not what I expected after watching the first movie. I actually was extremely annoyed by her and thought she was trying to make him decide on his best friend or her.\nSecond, Elle and Noah. Their relationship was a mess but the chemistry was on point this time around. I felt myself liking them a lot more, which is funny since they broke up in real life when filming this. The whole situation with a Chloe and Marco was just a disaster and nothing is really explained. It definitely felt like something was missing. Noah's facial expressions were not matching with what he was saying at all.\nThird, Lee and Elle barely had any screen time together. I wanted to see more friendship moments with the two of them.\nAnd lastly, I didn't feel it with the new cast. Marco and Elle I was just not liking at all. I mean clearly he was the better guy but I just didn't feel any chemistry. Chloe was flirting way too much with Noah. It was honestly disgusting.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the real life situations being used on this movie."]
