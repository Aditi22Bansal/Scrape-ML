["It's truly unfortunate the marketing campaign for this film couldn't have been stronger because this is a far cry from the childish films (and some of them work quite well) that illumination puts out on a year-year basis. Onward presents story beats that rival some of Pixar's best over the years with a touching final 15 minutes that catapulted this film up the ranks on this studio's finest work. And most of all, I think the film's ultimate message is one of utmost importance and something we can all learn from. Sometimes the very thing you've been looking for has been right there in front of you the entire time.8.8/10"]
