['Like many Disney movies these days, I was more-or-less obligated to watch. My daughter was excited about it and wanted me to watch it too. As they say, "If you like it, I love it." Well, not quite. I fell asleep for a spell. I think one of the druuns got me and turned me to stone for a few scenes."Raya and the Last Dragon" takes place in a fictitious land called Kamundra. Without going into the detail of the hows and whys, the main character has to collect pieces of a broken crystal ball in order to bring back all the people turned to stone by the druuns (a plague based upon the discord of people that took physical shape). The main character, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), is aided by the dragon Sisu (Awkwafina),The movie was funny and upbeat, just not enough to keep me fully engaged.']
