["You know that tingling feeling you get when you get a fright - a bit (I imagine) like getting a little electric shock? Well don't expect anything like that from this haunted house yarn. In this case, the malevolent spirit seems to have emigrated from Japan to wreak havoc on any who enter it's house. Andrea Riseborough is the new cop in town who sets about getting to the bottom of the mystery. It's not an awful film, it's just neither scary nor funny. It's great that movies like this continue to drive fans to see it at the cinema, and it doesn't drag - it's just a mediocre effort at best."]
