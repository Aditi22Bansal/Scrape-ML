["I don't know what the deal is for a video game adaption this Mortal Kombat is the closet thing to accurate in my opinion. Got to see this in RPX which is an exhilarating theater experience glad I didn't watch on HBO it wouldn't have been as epic! I absolutely love how brutal the fights/murder scenes were. Some of my reviews don't get enough appreciation so at least take the positivity from me."]
