["So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable! This sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was meant to be released last year, finally comes & to be honest it wasn't bad!The film follows Eddie Brock & his new buddy companion Venom as he tries to navigate life with him! But when a super villain also gets a new buddy companion called Carnage, polar opposite to what Eddie Brock has does it get real & it's up to Eddie Brock & Venom to stop him & his girlfriend with super screaming powers!I found the film to be pretty good! It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10."]
