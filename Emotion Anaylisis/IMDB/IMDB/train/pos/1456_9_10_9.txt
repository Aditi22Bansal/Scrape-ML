["Fatherhood is a 2021 Netflix/Columbia Pictures Comedy Drama starring Kevin Hart,Melody Hurd,Deborah Ayorinde and Alfre Woodard. Directed by Chris Weiz(who was\nthe writer for About A Boy) and based on a novel by Matthew Logelin titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir Of Loss and Love. The story is about Matthew Logelin(Hart) an African American who's been with his wife Liz(Deborah Ayorinde) since they were kids. However when Matt's wife is pregnant and has to go under a C Section for her baby,tragedy strikes when Liz dies leaving Matt heartbroken as he is left to rear his daughter Maddy(Melody Hurd) on his own without a mother figure for his child. While struggling with Maddy,Matt later meets a woman named Swan(DeWanda) and he strikes a relationship with her. But is he moving too quick or will he learn the challenges of being a single parent as well as facing obstacles along the way?Alot of people may be baffled as to why they cast an African American for Matt Logelin instead of a Causcian but I didn't pass any remarks on the casting for this film.Kevin Hart was very good in this film(he also served as a producer too with Chris Weiz), as I am so used to seeing him as the wise cracking buddy of Dwanye Johnson and being typecast in alot of his films.I've always loved Kevin Hart so that's why I watched it. If your a fan of Kevin Harts do check it out on Netflix.B."]
