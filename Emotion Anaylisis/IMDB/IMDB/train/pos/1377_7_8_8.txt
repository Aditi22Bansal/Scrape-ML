['Seriously Mr. Apatow... 136 minutes of "too much filler, not enough substance"? This was way too long and way too slow. The only reason I didn\'t fall asleep, was Davidson\'s fine balance of pathos and humor throughout the film. His story was very relatable and he performed/portrayed it quite well. The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would\'ve been a real hit. Still, mad props to Davidson for telling his story so well. Too bad Apatow didn\'t write and direct it better.']
