["Greyhound (4 out of 5 stars).Greyhound is a good war film that follows Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) as his ship escorts a group of cargo ships during WWII. Which they come across a nazi submarine that plays cat and mouse with them. As they battle to survive.This film is very fast paced. With very little to none on the character and story development. Occasionally having Krause having flashbacks of his wife played by Elizabeth Shue. The film is non stop action which you may have to buckle up for this wild ride. The plot is good. About Krause captaining Greyhound ship and trying to escort others.The direction does deliver a chaotic battle sequence. Putting you right in the crew's perspective with the action. As they see a sub ascending with a torpedo coming towards them or seeing a ship flashed from an explosion. The action is big, loud, and chaotic which you have to see on the big screen. The music score was great as it created that intense feeling and mood when a threat is near.I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks script which did not have any character development or characterization with anyone. The script is consist of crew members yelling out orders or demands on the ships actions. Which was thin and lacking for about anything else for a war movie.But it was one wild ride that will have you on the edge of your seat."]
