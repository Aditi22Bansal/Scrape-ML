['Greetings from Lithuania."Mortal Kombat" (2021) was a bit of surprising fun. I expected it to bad, but it turned out to be fun flick, and definitely not a bad one. It has cool fights, cool kills and fun writing. I liked characters but that is because i played these games a lot back in the day. If you are not familiar with lore, you won\'t get much excitement from it I\'m sure.Overall, i liked this flick. The decision to make it R rated movie was a very good decisions. I kinda wish they brought guys who made "Raid" movies fights for a next film - i hope you know what i mean. Also outcome in this movie for what it was came way to quick. Acting was pretty descent for this material. All in all this is fun flick especially if you like the source material.']
