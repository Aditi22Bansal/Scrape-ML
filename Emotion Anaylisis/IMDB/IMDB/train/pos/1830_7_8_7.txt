['I watched this twice, 3 weeks apart, at home on DVD from my public library. Unfortunately there are no "extras" regarding making of the movie.Ewan McGregor is the grown up little Dan Torrance from "The Shining." He has had a difficult life including turning to alcohol in struggling with his innate ability to "shine." Unlike the first movie, which was almost entirely in the lodge in the winter, this one is set at various locations across the USA, but getting back to the lodge near the end is necessary to wrap up the story.Although this is not my favorite genre, and I\'m not a big fan of "The Shining", I really like this movie. It has lots of complexity and interesting characters. Even though it runs a bit over 2 hours it never seemed long.Good movie and Rebecca Ferguson is also very good as Rose The Hat who with her band of shiners capture children who shine and absorb their steam so that they may live almost forever. But Dan and Abra have something to say about that.']
