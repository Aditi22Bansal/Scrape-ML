['"The Father" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called "Kitchen Sink Drama"--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, "Who am I?"It wasn\'t entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne\'s "husband" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.']
