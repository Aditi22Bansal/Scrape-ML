['\'Dune\' is a stunning, gourgeous looking Sci-fi Epic that faithfully adapts source material into the Big screen with class and craft. Villeneuve shows why he is a masterful filmmaker. This movie deserves to be witness in the biggest screen with the loudest sound system possible, not on TV. Because of its impressive photography and scenography. Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that\'s a flaw easily forgettable. And this is world so Big, so ambitious that as Zendaya says closing the movie: "This is only the beginning".Warner, don\'t be stupid and make Part II as soon as possible. I want to see how this story goes further.']
