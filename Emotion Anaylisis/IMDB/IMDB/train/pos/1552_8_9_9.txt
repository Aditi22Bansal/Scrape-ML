['When a space mission goes awry, the craft crash lands leaving only one survivor - the captain "Konstantin Veshnaykov" (Pyotr Fyodorov) who, on the face of it appears ok. The military authorities draft in accomplished psycho-analyst Tatyana Klimova" (Oksana Akinshina) to give him the once over and she discovers he is harbouring a symbion that has a bit of a penchant for human flesh... I actually quite enjoyed this. It has an authentic, almost bakelite, style to it - and that helps sustain quite a suspenseful sci-fi drama with the odd twist in the tail - and an alien that is a little more creatively designed that the usual bug-eyed nonsense. There is an half-decent sense of jeopardy as the look of the film, too - dark and dingy - helps generate an extra bit of menace. Certainly, it is a cannibalisation of a great many films that have come before; but that doesn\'t make it awful - indeed, though basic in it\'s premiss, the production standards are quite high and it sends a salutary signal to Hollywood that their days of producing derivative, old hat, sci-fi will have to change if they want to keep ahead of the game...']
