['Rich man Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) brings back life from a passing comet. These life forms combine with humans and form a dual life. Reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes one of those that combine with an alien. This is a different kind of superhero, more on the order of Deadpool who crosses lines of good and evil. Like most of the Marvel series, the film has great special effects, a long dragged out climax fight that is too long, humor, and a Stan Lee cameo. This one also has 1 F-word.']
