["It delivers. It doesn't limit itself to be just an action/drama/revenge film, it gives important lessons about choices, about relationships, about grief and about forgiveness.Once again, Mads Mikkelsen has a fantastic performance (that moment on the bathroom, god damn!) but all the supporting cast do a very good job."]
