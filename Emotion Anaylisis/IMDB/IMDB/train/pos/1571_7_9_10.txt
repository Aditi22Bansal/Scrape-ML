["Powerful story told very well. The emotion was just amazing. I knew nothing about the real world events that this film is based on, and I feel like that's a problem. A lot more people should know this story. This is a difficult watch that is bolstered by top tier filmmaking and acting. Overall, I thought this was a great film. It's a very important story told very well, and it definitely deserved its Oscar nomination."]
