["In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes. The cinematography isn't bad with interesting camerawork at times. As for the acting I thought the two major characters played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku were very believable in their roles. Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie."]
