['I\'ve seen this movie because of its controversy, wanted to see if it\'s really as shocking as everyone says. I don\'t know, maybe I grew up in Indonesia\'s culture, so it\'s so provocative for me. Good coming of age story, but no matter the "message" of a story, for sexualizing children (even in acting) is wrong, but it\'s 2020 after all.']
