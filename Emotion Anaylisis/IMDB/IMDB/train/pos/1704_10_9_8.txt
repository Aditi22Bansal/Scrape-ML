['Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I think this is one of the best James Bond films ever made. I wasn\'t a fan of Daniel Craig\'s "Bond" before this.....but I am now. He was outstanding, as was the whole cast. So was the photography (Roger Deakins - one of the best cinematographers in the business) and the action scenes were extremely entertaining. Sure, some - like the opening - were over-the-top but that\'s what we\'ve all come to expect and enjoy with the Bond movies. This opening scene ranks among the most astounding.Javier Bardem ("No Country For Old Men") makes a fascinating villain, even though he doesn\'t appear for the first hour of the film.I\'ve watched the movie three times in just over a year - which is unusual for me - and enjoyed it each time.']
