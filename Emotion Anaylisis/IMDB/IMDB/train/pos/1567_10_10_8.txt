['Now I am not familiar with the novel/source of this and when or how this was created. What I do know is that it does try hard to encapsulate and "rip off" Harry Potter and live off of that success. Now fair to say and as you can tell by the rating at the moment (which I matched), that most think they did not meet that standard by a longshot.Having said, the cast is not bad at all. The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this. But the cocky teenager that is fron and center here does not bode well, even if he has some good points he\'s making. So I don\'t think there\'s more to be said ... except that it looks unlikely this will get any follow ups soon ... (and watch the pitch meeting on Youtube which is as all their other Meetings super funny)']
