["What a movie for us to feel patriotic on this Independence DayThe makers have really worked hard on this plot the director Abhishek has left no corner to cover about this sequence of warIt is shooted so widely with great VFX work you will feel as if you are seeing a Hollywood movie like top gun..the air fights are extremely mind blowing..the airbase and army base with the firings shown gives a thumping punch with background scoresAjay's voice gives a effect of a true brave soldier and he acted at his best with sanju baba and othersIt is far better than shershaah and offer our salute to our national hero's by watching this movie."]
