There is nothing new to this story either and there are a few pretty implausible plot turns, that prevent it from becoming a spectacular thriller.

Despite some predictable and implausible plot turns and despite a predictable happy end, there is still enough action and suspense to keep me entertained. Rather impressive firestorm photography tops it of...The story: Angelina Jolie protects a kid who witnessed a murder, during a firestorm. Will they survive both the fire and the killers who are chasing them? Duh...']
