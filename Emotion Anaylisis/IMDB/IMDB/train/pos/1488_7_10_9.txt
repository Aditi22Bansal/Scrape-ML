["Absolutely incredible cinematography probably the best aspect about it! I guess others are right about the story going nowhere but it was definitely nice to watch spontaneously with my mom which I don't usually well with being an aspie. The cast and epicness that occurs is magnificent! Definitely left me feeling uncertain in parts and slightly bored regardless I love a large portion of it."]
