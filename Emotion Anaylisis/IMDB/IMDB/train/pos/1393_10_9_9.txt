['"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga" is a Comedy - Music movie in which we watch two musicians having a dream representing their country Iceland at the world\'s biggest song competition, Eurovision Song Contest. They succeed on taking the chance to represent their country and now they have to prove to everyone that they can win.I liked this movie because it had a simple, nice and very funny plot combined very well with some romantic scenes. For one more time Will Ferrell who played as Lars Erickssong was simply hilarious and his interpretation was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will like it and you will laugh a lot.']
