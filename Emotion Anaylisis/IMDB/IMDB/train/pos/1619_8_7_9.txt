["I knew nothing about this film before watching it except that it sexualised children. However I wanted to know what the hulla baloo was about because Hollywood has been sexualising them for years.\nAs it turns out i think this is a fantastic film with a really strong message that the overly dramatic and faux moralistic brigade will have missed because they don't think further than a Sun headline.\nI could talk all night about how this film simply shows in very clear terms what society is doing to our kids, but the ones who need to listen won't.\nIf you want this type of film, which reflects real life, to stop, then stop Rihanna who's very highly sexualised moves has inspired young pre teen girls for years. Stop Rihanna, stop Miley Cyrus, stop all of the people who basically sell their sex and inspire ever younger children to emulate them.\nThis film does not sexualise young girls, it shows how the world is sexualising pre teens. If you want to find fault find fault there."]
