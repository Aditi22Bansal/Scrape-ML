["Mortal Kombat has been rebooted as a gore laden and a more serious action packed movie.It is surprisingly entertaining but a predictable film. The director makes effective use of some visceral battle fights.It starts off in 17th Century Japan. Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) kills the ninja clan led by Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. He kills Hanzo as well as his wife and son.Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's infant daughter to safety.In the present day. Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten tournaments known as Mortal Kombat. If Earthrealm loses the tenth tournament, it can be conquered by Outworld.An ancient prophecy that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will bring a new generation of Earthrealm's champions. One such person is a former MMA fighter named Cole Young (Lewis Tan.)The movie needed a bit more humour. I thought Kano (Josh Lawson) who provided some of the banter quickly became tiring.The big problem was the lack of a well known star so this really is a B movie fodder. However for a movie based on a computer game franchise, it is still one of the better ones."]
