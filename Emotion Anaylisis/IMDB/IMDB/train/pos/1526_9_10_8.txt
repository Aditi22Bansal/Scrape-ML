["I'm really surprised by the relatively low ratings this movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what people expect nowadays from movies like this one? A movie based on a true story, but most of all an incredible story, very well written and directed by Francis Annan, clearly someone who knows how to build a tension with just minimalistic elements in the plot. I sat at the edge of my seat for some parts of this very enjoyable movie. The cast was also great, with a Daniel Radcliffe that proves again that he evolved from Harry Potter to an all round actor. He can play about anything and he did a great job again. To me Escape From Pretoria is definitely going to end in my top ten movies of this year. If you're a fan of escape movies then you surely won't be disappointed by this one. It belongs in the list of great prison escape movies, and it's based on true events what makes it always better. The negative critics on here have no clue about good movies, just ignore them and give this one a shot, you won't regret it."]
