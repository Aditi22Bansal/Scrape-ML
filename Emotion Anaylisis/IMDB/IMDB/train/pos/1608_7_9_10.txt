['"The Banker" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the real story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who built their business empire by hiring a white man pretending to be the head of their businesses.I liked this movie very much because it was based on a simply amazing true story. The direction which was made by George Nolfi, it was very good and I liked very much that in the end of the movie showed us real photographs of the real people. The interpretations of both Samuel L. Jackson who played as Joe Morris and Anthony Mackie who played as Bernard Garrett were very good and I was really surprised by the interpretation of the last. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Nicholas Hoult\'s who played as Matt Steiner. To sum up, I have to say that "The Banker" is a nice movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it because everyone needs to know about this story.']
