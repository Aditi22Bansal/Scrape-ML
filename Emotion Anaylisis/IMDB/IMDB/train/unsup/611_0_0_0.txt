["Archer is James Bond in sitcom form. Unlike Bond, Archer's mother is the head of the secret service agency he works for. And this mother and son couple do not get along at all. They find joy in the other's humiliation and/or pain. This show is incredibly entertaining, and while the animation is impressive in detail it feels weird to watch at times because it doesn't have the same 'flow' as cel-animation. That's probably because it's done on Adobe After Effects and/or Flash.Spy fiction is a creative pool writers can screw around with endlessly: they can dig into the many clich√©s of James Bond films, The Bourne Films, and just being all-round nostalgic for films of the 60s. It's like if Ian Fleming teamed up with Mel Brooks, Trey Parker and Matt Groening.Very good stuff, and guarantees your full attention and enjoyment."]
