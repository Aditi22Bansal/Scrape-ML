["A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****"]
