["I'm still so annoyed with BBC3 for switching to online only, I still enjoy watching the show on my lunch break at work, but it doesn't beat watching it on the box.Fleabag is one of the best shows to come from BBC3 since the likes of Gary Tank Commander and Cuckoo. I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved. Olivia Colman can do no wrong, but it's nice to see her cast in a very different role, so often playing a 'sweet' character, she shows her versatility. Bill Patterson great also,"]
