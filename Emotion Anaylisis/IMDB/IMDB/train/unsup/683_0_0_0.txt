["Riveting performances all the way through, many parts give me the best goosebump feeling! Jodie Comer is gorgeous and one of the coolest assassins to me! Very well deserving every award, praise and otherwise supporting it! Sandra Oh is an outstanding actress; her acting is sublime perfection. I'm blown away barely anyone hasn't recommended Killing Eve to me before. If anyone wants to watch one of the greatest shows ever made with incredible suspense this is the perfect treat for you, if not at least I put my thoughts out."]
