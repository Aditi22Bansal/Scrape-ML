['This was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. The script is really dreadful and the premiss that an Amazonian daughter of Zeus heads into the 20th century to help the Brits during the First World War is as far fetched as it goes. That said, there is some chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and David Thewlis is quite menacing at times as "Sir Patrick/Ares". The CGI isn\'t too oppressive and the (frequent) fight scenes though lengthy, are quite well staged. It\'s all just a bit of fun - quite comedic at times - and fine to watch on that basis.']
