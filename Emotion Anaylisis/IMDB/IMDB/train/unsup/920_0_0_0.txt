["Positives:\n1. Addresses, mostly from a teen perspective, bullying (w/suicide); social conformity & attracting attention; drugs/alcohol etc.; parenting; educational process including administration at the high school level.\n2. Acting & events/situations were just barely accurate, just overacted for dramatic effect.\nNegatives:\n1. Dragged on w/too many editing flashbacks; time filling trivial; needless over indulgent acting & made-up situations not likely to be seen at a school.\n2. Mentioned above the overacting & over-characterization for dramatic effect (made for TV so what to expect?) gives a misleading portrait of your typical high school behavior.\nMost importantly was the inaccurate portrayal of the counselor (and other school administrators, and teachers). Counselors & teachers have many legal impediments in terms of pursuing topics of a personal nature to students. They also are heavily restrained from physically touching the acting-out student even when said student is very disruptive or just a little harmful.\n3. Contrary to the movie's characterization most students are actually boringly good conscientious students. Although many know how far they can go to take up class time with talk & swagger.\n4. Next season they could go the gun angle since they showed a student w/a weapon; an unfortunate obvious topic. Or it may be too sensitive a topic."]
