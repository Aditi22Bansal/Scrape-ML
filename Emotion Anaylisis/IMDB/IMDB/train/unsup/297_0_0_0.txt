['It\'s gotten to the point where all of Tom Cruise\'s movies are essentially the exact same story with a different setting. He always fights danger, barely avoiding getting killed. Usually it\'s an urban setting with car crashes, but "Oblivion" is set in an irradiated post-apocalyptic world with killer robots. Even if you\'re concerned about nuclear proliferation and figure that this movie might warn about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust, "Oblivion" comes across only as a movie produced with the aim of making a zillion dollars. This is one movie that deserves to get forgotten very quickly."Mom, Tom Cruise won\'t come out of the closet!" - one of the boys on "South Park"']
