["It Really is Hard to Imagine Anyone but an Eight Year Old Girl (apologies to eight year old Girls) Deriving much Entertainment from this Movie, or the Franchise. It is so Dumbed Down, Illiterate, and Dull that it Never Creates any Sparks, let alone Catches Fire.From the Story that is All Surface about Totalitarianism and Fascism, to the Shallowness of the Whole and God-Awful Gaudy Costuming to the One-Dimensional Characters, Anyone Seeking Anything of Substance Here, will Discover Nothing, Except in the Most Superficial Display.The Repression and Starvation are Shown as Dirty Faces and Tattered Clothes with the Downtrodden Insights Reduced to Staring Sunken Faces. Nothing is Ever Contemplated or Explored. This Thing is so Excruciatingly Shallow and Lightweight it can't even Manage to Sink from its own Excesses.The Final Bit, the Actual Games, are so Recycled and Unimaginative as to Boggle the Bean. The Grand Finale has Blood Rain, Diseased Fog, a Spinning Clock, and for the Big Bang...Baboons. This is what Passes as Epic Entertainment and Large Scale, Teen Friendly, Rah-Rah these Days. Wispy, Unengaging, Bland, and Embarrassing this is one of those Blockbusters that in Ten Years will hardly get more than a Casual Glance and that Only to See what all the Fuss was about. Good Question."]
