["ID4 works as a sci-fi action film with humans against aliens.  But the story is used from other alien movies and the characters are thin and usual for these movies.  Still, this is a big action apocalypse that hs attracted audiences all over the world.  Most likely though, this film hasx a message. What message i it?  Well, the scene where the White house and Empire State building shows how if you are in the theater, you'll cheer like FDR was president forever.  Maybe the message is were already in apocalypse, and only Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum will save us.  Great entertainment all around.  A"]
