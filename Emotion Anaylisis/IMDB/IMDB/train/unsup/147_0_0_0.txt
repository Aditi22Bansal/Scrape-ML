['When I agreed to watch this Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film with my movie theatre working friend today, the "Skip It" reviews of Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott were still on my mind but since I\'d like to make up my own mind about anything, I thought, "What the Hell." I\'ll admit also up front that while I almost fell asleep sometimes during this, by the time of the Big Revelation, I was wide awake and wanting to learn more. Also, despite my almost sleepy demeanor, I was enthralled by DiCaprio\'s lead performance, by Scorsese\'s direction, as well as fine supporting performances by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Michelle Williams. Nothing much more to say except this was another very compelling opus by the great director and his frequent leading man that I highly recommend.']
