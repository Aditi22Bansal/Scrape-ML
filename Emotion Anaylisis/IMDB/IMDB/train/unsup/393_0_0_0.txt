['I\'ve read a lot about how "Shaun of the Dead" borrows a lot from a TV show called "Spaced". I have to admit that I\'ve never heard of "Spaced". But even so, this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it\'s sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it, and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I\'d never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing "SOTD", but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline\'s wife in "Cry Freedom") and Bill Nighy.']
