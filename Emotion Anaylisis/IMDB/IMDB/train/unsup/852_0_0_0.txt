['This was a quaint little show that could featuring the comedic day to day misadventures of Eric Forman and his small group of friends as they grow up in the otherwise dreary awful \'me\' decade of the 1970\'s. I wasn\'t sure if I\'d like this show before I watched it. But thankfully all the crappy 70\'s nostalgia was kept pretty much to a minimum and it thankfully allowed the characters some breathing room (this is why the polar opposite "That 80\'s Show" failed dismally). Sadly after 3 or 4 seasons the show became a pale parody of itself culminating in a simply unwatchable 8th season. If the show only lasted half that long it would\'ve been fine with me. That 70\'s show was never anywhere close to classic in any way, shape, or form and other comedies of the \'90\'s could and did run circles around it, but in the beginning seasons it was a fun enough time waister. By the way the best part of the show was definitely Eric\'s father, Red.My Grade: C']
