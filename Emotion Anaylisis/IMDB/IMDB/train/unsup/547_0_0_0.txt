["The main problem of Riverdale is it does not make any sense. I would not be okay even if they were all in college. But guess what, they are in high school. I love high school dramas. But I couldn't love Riverdale. Because it is so funny and absurd in every way possible. I liked the first season. They had a purpose to find who killed Jason, Betty being a highschool girl etc. It also had it bad moments but I was fine with that. Then came season 2 and slowly the series began to crash. I didn't know if it could go further bad after watching the final episodes of season 2. Then came season 3 with more bad writing and bad moments. The 21st episode gave me a small hope though as they slowly unveiled the mysteries. But the final episode just was the same old Riverdale which sucks. I don't know what they are going to do in season 4 but still going to watch."]
