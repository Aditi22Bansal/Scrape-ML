['Fan of "Seinfeld" and watched all seasons of this series. Season 9 shows it\'s time to pack it in and retire. The episodes are not as satirical as before and greater reliance is placed on star power cameos to carry them. It\'s always best to go out on the highest note possible. That should be now as another season on this trajectory will be a disaster.']
