['It\'s weird to think that in the past 20 years, only FOX (of all channels) has aired any good shows: "The Simpsons", "The X Files", "That \'70s Show" and "Malcolm in the Middle". The last one shows the adventures of Malcolm Wilkerson (Frankie Muniz) and his wacky family. Disorganized mom Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), uptight dad Hal (Bryan Cranston), impulse control-lacking older brother Reese (Justin Berfield), and over-imaginative younger brother Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan).Every episode that we\'ve seen, we\'ve liked. We particularly like how it shows the kids raising themselves while the parents have other things to do. Probably my favorite episode was where Malcolm went bowling. It had a split screen: on one side his mom took him and on the other side his dad took him. His mom proceeded to be a control freak, while his dad let them do their own things.It\'s quite an original show. So watch it. You won\'t be disappointed.']
