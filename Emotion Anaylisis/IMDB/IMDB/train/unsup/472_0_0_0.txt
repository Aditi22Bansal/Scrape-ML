["Their are sooo many reasons why this new TV show should not work.For starters, the religious aspects of it. Then you have the done- so-many-times-before teaming up with the police factor. Then you have the typical sexist issues relevant in this show. And so on, and so on. BUT, it did work, and very well so!From the first episode, I had my doubts, but you couldn't help enjoying each character, especially Tom Ellis playing the role of the devil. Combining all of these characters, considering their respective religious earthly roles, then adding the factor of solving crimes, was actually very entertaining.Setting this show in Los Angeles and its associated lifestyle/nightlife was a huge plus.As the show progressed, I was curious to see what more can happen. Well, a lot did, and it was all executed perfectly.Props to the writers and director for finally taking many clich√©s, and bundling them up, mixing them around and creating a hit TV show!I hope this show keeps renewing its seasons, and look forward to see what happens next!It's a 9/10 from me!"]
