['"World War Z", directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt\'s character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.']
