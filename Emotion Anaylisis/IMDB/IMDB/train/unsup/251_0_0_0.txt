['This film is about a stunt driver whose is being hunted by gangsters, after his heist has gone wrong.I thought "Drive" was an adrenaline fueled action film, but in fact it is anything but that. It is more an art house film, but does not succeed in impressing me because of its slow pace and manufactured atmospheric scenes. There are so many times when I just stare at the counter and see how long scenes are unnecessarily stretched to. After the attack in the motel room, Ryan Gosling spends 20 seconds staring into space. Ryan Goslign and Carey Mulligan spends a full minute kissing in the lift. There are so many overlong scenes that just bored me to death. And the heist in question does not happen two thirds into the film! "Drive" is seriously boring. I wish I could have my 90 minutes back.']
