['One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners, and surely one of the most over-rated movies of all time. (Not THE worst, that honour definitely goes to the 1931 version of Cimarron). Historically inaccurate anti-English propaganda, with wooden over-the-top-macho-hero acting. The only good part was when Wallace was executed.Plot summary: Mel Gibson sets out to make an anti-English movie, because that was the phase he was going though (The Patriot was even worse), and wins a few Oscars in the process.Also a great example of how clueless the people are who determine the Oscar winners. In a year that brought such fantastic movies as "Leaving Las Vegas", "The Usual Suspects", "Dead Man Walking", "Twelve Monkeys" and "Richard III", they gave five Oscars, incl Best Picture and Best Director, to this piece of crap.']
