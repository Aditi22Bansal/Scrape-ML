['This show is absolutely great. The pilot episode is not the best in the series, so don\'t let that stop you. This show is full of jokes, puns, whit and nostalgia for anyone in their 30s to 50s to enjoy. James and Dule play very well off each other and the entire cast has great chemistry. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is a fan of sitcoms as well as crime dramas.\nThis show centers around Shawn Spencer, a man in his mid to late twenties that has issues holding down a job. His dad, a retired detective for the Santa Barbara police department had trained Shawn as a kid to be hyper observant. Shawn had been using this ability to help police solve crimes by phoning in tips. In the pilot episode this ends up having Shawn pulled in for questioning. In a panic, he tells the police he is psychic. They test this claim out and he uses his powers of observation to solve a crime, and he opens a detective agency with his childhood friend Burton "Gus" Guster. Unfortunately the show only lasted 8 seasons. It is definitely in my top ten favorite shows. Be sure to check out Psych the musical!!!']
