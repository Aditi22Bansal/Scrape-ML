["There isn't anyone in this movie that I would ever say I wanted to see in a movie. The entire cast is completely unknown, so I can't have any preconceptions.Of course, it did get a lot of Teen Choice nominations, which would make it a movie I wouldn't go near except it may possibly make it on the expanded Best Picture list next year, so I have to sorta watch it.The funniest parts of the movie were the supporting cast: the wedding chapel manager, the cops (Ken Jeong & Cleo King), the doctor (Matt Walsh), the naked Japanese guy, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the tiger. There was not one funny moment involving the main characters except for the escape in the cop car."]
