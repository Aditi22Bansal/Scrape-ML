['Over the years, I had heard of many superheros: Superman, Spider-Man, the Hulk, the X Men. However, until Jon Favreau\'s "Iron Man" came to theaters, I had never heard of Iron Man! That made the movie even more of a treat. I liked how they incorporated world events into the story: in this case, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) makes weapons for the army but has misgivings after his experience in Afghanistan. I\'ll admit that I\'m not really any fan of superhero stories. But I do think that they did a good job with this movie, so I recommend it.Also starring Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sayed Badreya, and of course Stan Lee in a brief appearance.']
