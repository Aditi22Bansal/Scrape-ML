['Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police chief that takes charge of picking up the pieces of the crime that has come unraveled.Strong violence and foul language go hand in hand with the awkward and hilarious situations. You will certainly be eager to watch this one again immediately.']
