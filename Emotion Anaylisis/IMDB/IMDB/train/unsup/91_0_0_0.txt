["If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!"]
