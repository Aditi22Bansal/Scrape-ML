['Amongst the sea of crime shows clogging up the air waves, this one is better than most. The casting, acting and writing are above average. Personally though the gratuitous use of graphic gore gets to be tiresome. It seems like the writing staff sit around and compete to see how they can introduce more disgusting situations each week when in reality bodies do not decompose at the rate they depict and for the most part are intact. This, in addition to how the squints can pinpoint locations and facial recognition from some of the most far fetched ways detracts from what is basically a pretty good series. There are some interesting characters, but also many inconsistencies in their behaviours/development. As the seasons progress, there tends to be an overemphasis on their sexual personal lives which is typical of Hollywood agendas.']
