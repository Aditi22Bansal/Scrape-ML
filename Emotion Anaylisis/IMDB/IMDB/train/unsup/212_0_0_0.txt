["Just watched Thor in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and while I admit I fell asleep during some of the beginning parts, by the time the title character's brother Loki reveals his intentions, I was riveted the rest of the picture. Kenneth Branagh is fine directing the dialogue and action sequences and the one picked to play Thor is quite charismatic especially when talking to the mortal Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema. Oh, and Loki as the villain is very compelling when he's revealed as such and one more thing, look for creator Stan Lee in a cameo since this is a Marvel-based movie of a character he created..."]
