["If i remember right, an important detail in marketing Boardwalk Empire has been the involvement of Martin Scorcese and Mark Wahlberg as executive producers. There were others, but not as important as these two.Now, Scorcese's projects in the past decade or so ranged between barely watchable (Gangs of New York) over mediocre flicks (Wolf of Wall Street) to exciting dramas (Shutter Island, The Departed) and even nice documentaries (George Harrison: Living in the Material World). Judging by this track record, Boardwalk Empire could have been anywhere between a disaster and a masterpiece.Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, has been the man behind Entourage, one of the lamest TV shows i've seen. But i didn't want to be judgmental and gave Boardwalk Empire a try.Probably the most important thing is to understand that Boardwalk Empire successfully interweaves facts with fiction. Looking at the storyline, each season kicked off rather uneventful and roughly after the first half the writers changed gears and headed toward the finale. The series is laced with violence and a fair amount of gore and female nudity. It would be interesting to understand whether the viewers wanted to see those three or the producers decided that it would be good idea to focus on them.Needless to say, the hype surrounding Boardwalk Empire was very strong, although the product was mediocre."]
