['I can\'t believe that it took me this long to get around to seeing "The Sopranos". I had heard a lot about it, but I can affirm that with this show, "Six Feet Under" and "Game of Thrones", HBO revolutionized TV in the 21st century. A gritty look at a mob boss and how he tries to balance his work life and family, this show pulls no punches. One of the points that it makes is that there aren\'t really any "good" or "bad" characters. People do what they think best serves the family.I don\'t know if I would go so far as to call it the greatest show ever - my personal fave of HBO\'s series is "Six Feet Under" - but the writing, acting and direction combine to make something that you won\'t get on the networks or basic cable. If you want to understand some of the best that TV can provide, then you owe it to yourself to watch "The Sopranos". Great show.Too bad that James Gandolfini, Nancy Marchand and the recently deceased Frank Vincent are no longer with us.']
