['I was able to watch the Sixth Sense on DVD on its first release today. As enjoyable as this movie is, the \'extras\' on the DVD make it twice as enjoyable. Included is a fine interview with the writer/director that helps put the whole story in perspective, which includes his personal and family influences.The votes currently place this movie at about #23 on the top 250 movies of all time. That\'s probably a bit of an overrating, considering all the other fine movies in the list. However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My "review" doesn\'t really say anything about the story itself. That is because it is best viewed if you know nothing about it first. Except to say that it is one of the very few movies that gets high ratings from viewers of all ages, and genders! If you haven\'t yet, then see it. The DVD version if you can, and watch the extras after. Jan 2007 update: I watched it again yesterday. Even though I knew the basic story, and how it would turn out, it was still a worthwhile re-watch. Night may never match his first effort.']
