["If this season six is a parody on the genre of clich√©d/trite hauntings from wronged past inhabitants who once lived in a rundown New England (or thereabouts) mansion followed by unexplained disappearances & murders with ghostly images, closing doors, things falling/flying and oftentimes filmed using the shaky camera redux technique then I give it three stars. Because, it had all that. Furthermore, it also had the overused shaky camera horror interviews of those who survived (or maybe didn't, but a filmed archive did), and even a shaky camera film crew meeting their demises from the ephemeral inhabitants. Otherwise, too much time spent on talking heads and everything else predictable."]
