['The DVD version is very well done, sharp video transfer and good soundtrack, but you need a system with a subwoofer to get the full benefit from "mood" music.This is *not* a movie for those looking for a nice story and a message.  The characters are all crooks.  They beat and shoot each other. They plot to steal each others\' money and guns. They use drugs.  They have no morals. My wife walked out half-way, but she doesn\'t usually like British movies. \nHowever, if you can get past all that, there is lots of funny stuff in this movie.  You find out from the extra DVD information that some of the crooks really are crooks with some acting experience, and it comes across that way.Imagine Trainspotting  meets Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and you\'ll have the gist of this flick.  I give it a 6 of 10.  But then, I thought The Waterboy was about the funniest movie ever!']
