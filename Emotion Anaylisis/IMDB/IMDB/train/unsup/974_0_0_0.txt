["The first season was interesting and even with some logical errors in the script I continued to watch. However getting half way through the second season I started to see a pattern with the script. Whomever was writing this crap just kept spreading the story too thin. It was as if they needed to stretch stuff out because they didn't have enough content to make the episodes interesting.There are too many deus ex machina devices being used. The characters are supposed to be these amazing geniuses in the field of computers but they end up being morons. Too many episodes where they do stuff which isn't realistic or logical. Too many contrived scenes which feel like a square peg being forced in to a round hole.The predictability of the script was terrible too. I could watch the opening scene and then skip to the ending and miss nothing in the middle.I ended up stopping towards the end of the second season. I couldn't handle the predictability of the characters or the overacting, the terrible dialog or the lack of logic. A good analogy would be like watching Family Guy which often uses filler scenes of Peter farting for sixty seconds."]
