["Crassly-funny zombie flick constructed by director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick to play out like a violent game of pinball, batting viewers around. Disenfranchised youth Jesse Eisenberg and Ã¼ber-macho, Twinkie-eating Woody Harrelson take on flesh-eating zombies in a virus-ravaged 21st century. Mostly threadbare comedic thriller, though occasionally prodding and amusing. The filmmakers are hopeless when delineating Eisenberg's lack of romantic skills with the ladies (it's a tiresome story thread), and the second-half falls off sharply from the first, not helped by an unfunny cameo from Bill Murray playing himself. The showdown with the zombies at an amusement park is limp, but Eisenberg's dryly self-assured presence brings out a sassy side to Harrelson which makes the actor more tolerable than usual. Otherwise, it's just mindless destruction: predictable, obvious and repetitive. ** from ****"]
