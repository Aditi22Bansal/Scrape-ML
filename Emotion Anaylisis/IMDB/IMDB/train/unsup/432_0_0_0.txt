['This movie wasn\'t made to satisfy the critics. It was made for the fans of the first Pirates movie (and of course for the Captain Jack Sparrow aficionado in most of us!). But still why do some people despise this movie? It\'s simple they point out, that it\'s not enough story to justify the running time. Although this is right to a great extent, it\'s not what you should be looking for in this movie. This movie was made to entertain, nothing more and nothing less. And although other movies do try that too (some fail others succeed), this one has Johnny Depp. It\'s as simple as that. Of course other actors are good here too, but the main attraction is Cpt. Jack.If you have seen the first one, you will eventually see this one too, so don\'t resist the urge to see it and don\'t listen to some of those critics, telling you it\'s a waste of time! It\'s up to you to decide, if you like it or not! (a last little note: The fabulous line from the trailer said by Will Turner: "Never mind, let\'s go!", has gone awol ... A shame, because it was great joke, but they kind of explain that on the audio commentary on the DVD)']
