["This show started not to long after Friends ended but I thought i was a perfect re-placement for Friends. I not lot fan don't like me Comparing both shows, both are set in new york and their daily love lives. I loved first 3 season, I thought every episode had in laughing and loud for 30 mins each week! Those series really well done as pace was really good in those series and there not many filler episode (This current season) After season 3, I think that when really start to lose it's charm , it did have some good decent and now again, I which really enjoyed. The next few season were a really mixed bag and this latest series is to me as been really bad, I have worst series yet, I don't think there was on decent episode I liked this year! I hoping this is the last season but those Kids on those couch have their own kids! 6 out of 10"]
