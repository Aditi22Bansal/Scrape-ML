['A fun if imperfect show. One of its MAJOR flaws is that it was driven a little too much by its fandoms. One of its bravest story lines at one point had former teacher Ezra Fitz as a possible "A" but due to the backlash it was quickly and quite badly backtracked. The same with Ali. Bad Girl Ali was one of the most interesting and entertaining characters on the show but by the end the need to pair her with good girl Emily had the show paint her as redeemed to the point of her being almost boring. That is and will always be the main drawback of the show. Forget the implausibility of many/most of the story lines. This was never billed as a very plausible show. It was a fun entertaining psychological thriller and stayed that way throughout. It was just that there were certain pairings that a large number of the fandom wanted as "endgame" most notably Ezra/Aria and Ali/Emily and writing into that made for some of the worst late series story lines. Still I would recommend the show to anyone who liked a good psychological thriller.']
