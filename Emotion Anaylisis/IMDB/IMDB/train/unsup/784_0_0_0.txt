["It's not necessary to ask the actors do the straight, gay or lesbian love-making, intercourse scenes, totally unnecessary. Viewers who appreciated this series don't actually needed those stuff. Asking these actors doing these unnecessary love-making scenes was not kind to them, 'cause it's the on-going interviews of the extremely violent, vicious, twisted-minded serial killers and the gradual development of the profiling science of the FBI that interested us, not the licking, grinding, kissing love-making sexual scenes between the straight or the lesbian persons motivated us to watch this series.The 2nd season spent too much episodes on the Atlanta serial killing investigation, I was a bit getting tired of these episodes. I also sympathize the actors who in order to show how people chain-smoking in the 60s, 70s and 80s, they had to smoke so many cigarettes in every episode, hope them won't get lung cancers after this drama series. Those who did the supporting roles in all the episodes, either smoking or inhaling the 2nd handed cigarette smoke in the restaurants, all the public places, in the airplane cabins, Jesus, what a disgust and shameful scene to watch.All the actors did superb fantastic acting jobs, salute! The scenes of 70s, the settings just looked so real, absolutely impeccable. This is a very serious and honest production, I salute to all of the people and praise them did a great job. Awaiting and craving the 3rd Season. I'm a fan."]
