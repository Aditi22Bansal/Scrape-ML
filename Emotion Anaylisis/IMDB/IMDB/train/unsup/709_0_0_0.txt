["This is a good ensemble-cast show (with a lead role) made in the same vein as the office. It generates plenty of laughs despite the lack of a laughtrack-it doesn't need one. Amy Poehler is perfect in the lead role as Leslie Knope, the head of the Parks & Recreation department in a small town in Indiana. She does her best to head her job and her department-often with hilarious results. Rashida Jones heads up a terrific supporting cast. Whether something going on in the city or someone in the department, this comedy finds some sort of hilarious situation in each episode, and the cast clicks perfectly as a workplace type sitcom. Amy Poehler strikes gold! *** out of ****"]
