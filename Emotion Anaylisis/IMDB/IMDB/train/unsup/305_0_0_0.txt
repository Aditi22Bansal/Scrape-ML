["Zombies are everywhere. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner and that may be why he is surviving the zombie apocalypse. Also he has come up with a list of rules to live by. On the way to Columbus to find his parents, he gets a ride from zombie killing Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who has a Twinkie obsession. He refuses to know anybody's names. The guys gets robbed by sister grifters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). They head to an L.A. amusement park that is rumored to be zombie free.It's an irreverent zombie movie in line with 'Shaun of the Dead' except not as much jokiness. Ruben Fleischer, mostly a TV director before this, is able to bring a quirky style to comedy writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. There is a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray. Even the kills are wacky. The four leads are eminently likable. The last act does turn into more of a straight up zombie fight. If the world does turn into Zombieland, I wouldn't mind riding with these four."]
