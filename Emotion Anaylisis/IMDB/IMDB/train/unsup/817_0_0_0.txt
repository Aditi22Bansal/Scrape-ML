["There are so many ways this could've gone totally wrong but this series is handled with seriousness and poignancy. Moreover the prison is full of rich, diverse characters with faces that the movie experts do recognize---Natasha Lyonne, Kate Mulgrew, Taryn Manning--- but most of them won't be recognized and recognizable, which is fine, because there's not a single Mischa Barton in this giant ensemble. These 13 episode are often quotable, very funny, occasionally violent and completely engrossing. Overall a perfect series, combining humor, drama and a bit of violence as well."]
