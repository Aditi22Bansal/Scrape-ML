["It's just almost halfway through first season but I can easily say this one of the best high school series I have ever seen. The direction and cinematography of this series is groundbreaking. All the performances are pitch perfect and Zendaya is simply one of the best young actresses. The series talks about many themes which are difficult to take but the creators did a great job. There's high rate of profanity which may trouble some but one can easily understand that it is needed for this series."]
