['If you don\'t know what mental illness is like, you might think this is a hilarious picture. It actually is in many respects, but if you haven\'t had any experience with people or family members dealing with mental health issues, you may not get the full impact of this film and what it means to remain in treatment and faithfully take prescribed medications. The writers either had that real life experience or did their research very faithfully, because the reactions of characters like Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are ones I\'ve observed personally with members of my own family. It\'s not always easy, and one must remain on the defensive more often than is comfortable when someone you care for is tortured by erratic mood swings and delusional thinking. It was struck home forcefully when Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) tells Pat in one of their sessions that "one incident can change a lifetime". I can vouch for that and am thankful every day when the meds are working and life approaches a semblance of normalcy. I thought this was a brilliant movie in the way it offers hope to those afflicted with mental health issues of their own, and a way to deal with them effectively given the proper support of friends and loved ones.']
