["This is highly competent television, as competent as Vikings or Boardwalk Empire. Oddly I'd be more inclined to compare it to Vikings than to say, Penny Dreadful or The Frankenstein Chronicles, despite a difference in periods. Tom Hardy is perfect and highly charismatic. This is probably his best role since Peaky Blinders. His character corkscrews around in outrageous self-assurance whilst the plot delivers surprise after surprise. The sets are as authentic as The Frankenstein Chronicles or Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. The characters are Dickensian, but all seem to have a dose of Viking in them. The villains are very human by comparison, but have a whole lot more power and resources. This is a wonderful against-the-odds story. It's wonderful when a period piece such as this transports the viewer into a world that despite its age, appears new, fresh, even young.Importantly for a possibly seminal work, this series won't leave anyone hanging with a rotten cliffhanger at the end. All the same, if there is a sequel I won't be lax in jumping to see it."]
