["Let's start off with one of the best drama shows in television. I agree it may not be perfect and can be unrealistic at time but brought some good humour. The good season were 1-6 but after that it went downhill and became a soap opera but at least it got a decent ending.Most of the characters get annoying in the later seasons and the bearable ones are Louis and Harvey and Jessica. Even though I like mike and Harvey friendship mike becomes more irritating when the season comes later by complaining and whining about everything\nI like Donna in the beginning but after season 5 she became annoying\nRachel is one of the most annoying characters, I've always feel like she always plays the victim all the time\nOh my god I love Jessica Harvey and Louis they bring flare and drama without being annoying unnecessary drama\nOverall it's an excellent show not perfect but still will be an iconic show"]
