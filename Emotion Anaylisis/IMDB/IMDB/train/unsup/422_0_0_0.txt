["Outstanding and high octane action. Be ready for an elevated heart-rate and possible blood sugar spike. No matter what role Liam Neeson takes you can pretty well count on getting more than your buck's worth. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former super-spy with remarkable skills. His estranged teenage daughter Kim(Maggie Grace)and her friend Amanda(Katie Cassidy)are in Europe following the band U2 on tour. In Paris, the two girls are kidnapped for entry into the sex slave trade. Mills will rely on the full extent of his special skills to track down the abductors and conduct a one-man war with the purpose of rescuing his daughter and applying furious vengeance on the ruthless gang of kidnappers.Suspense is high. Violence is swift and without mercy. Adrenaline has your heart bouncing against your Adam's apple. TAKEN is highly recommended. Also in the cast: Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Leland Orser, Arben Bajraktaraj and Holly Valance."]
