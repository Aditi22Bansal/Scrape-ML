["I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, no new ideas, no originality, it felt like a B version of Wonder Woman.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears."]
