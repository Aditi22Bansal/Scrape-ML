['after so many time and a lot of books, films, clubs , shows about vampires, it is strange to discover the series seductive like at the first meeting. maybe naive but it is not its sin. maybe soft but it is part of different period. but the same. a new hero, huge challenges, drops of love, horror and a brave girl. nothing new but so seductive ! for a decade it remains one of fundamental marks. for today it is more than a teenager series but a form of delight. because it reflects, in right manner, expectations, emotions and a beautiful story with deep roots. a new kind of hero and her extraordinaries adventures. the structure of each fairy tale.']
