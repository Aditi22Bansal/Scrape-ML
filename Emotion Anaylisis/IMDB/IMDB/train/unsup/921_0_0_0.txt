['Congratulations Netflix, You did it again!"13 Reasons Why" was so great in season 1 and should have ended there.\nThe series was dragged for a 2nd season, OK!, as long as Hannah was in it.But that, season 3, is such a mess, especially with that Ani ! that words are short of describing the situation.\nBritish accent, terrible look, terrible acting, terrible talking, in fact nothing is there in her favor, notwithstanding most ridiculous reasons and logic to shove her in the series in its 3rd season.Why should great series continue with nonsense scripts, be damaged to the core and milked bare until no greatness is left and only muddy and trashy memories remain..Please do yourself a favor and skip season 3, unless you enjoy constantly falling asleep while at the same time grinding your teeth noisily.']
