['A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Call me an apostate or what you will, but I do not think this is the "greatest superhero film ever made" or any of the other hyperbole going around. Is it a good story? Heck yes. Is it funny? Heck yes. And are the characters interesting? Heck yes. But it is also overshadowed by some mind-numbing special effects and lightning-fast editing that could be done without.Not to say this is a bad movie. It is not. At all. Among the Marvel films made so far, it is probably slightly better than average. Not quite on the level of the "Iron Man" movies, and definitely not as clever as the second "Captain America", but far, far ahead of the disappointment that was "Thor: The Dark World" (though, to be fair, Thor is a bad character to begin with).']
