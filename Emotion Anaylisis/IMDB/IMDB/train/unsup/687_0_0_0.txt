["As for Jodie Comer making this series - for me, yes. For someone who's resum√© is basically TV series after series she definitely gives us unforgettable drama. Series fits her w/physical challenges; playing w/costuming; getting out of the comfort zone; make believe role playing. Surprising how the Brits can pull off Russian accents. The hospital scene w/the 12 yr old patient in the bed next to her will not be forgotten; set the tone for what was to follow. Increased my rating over season 1."]
