['Director Sam Raimi brings back the Marvel comic book hero, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is still coming to terms with his dual identity. He\'s now going to college, delivering pizza and taking photos of...Spider-Man in order to pay his bills. His world is tumbling down around him; he\'s having trouble at college, his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco)is strained, his Aunt May(Rosemary Harris)is being pressured by the bank, and most of all wrestles with the thought of telling Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst)of his secret identity. The web-slinging Spider-Man has recently been bashed in the press; but NYC needs their hero for the city is threatened by Dr. Octo Octavius(Alfred Monlina)who has turned himself into Doc Ock, a multiple metal armed villain.CGI perfection. Danny Elfman\'s score meets his genius standards. The story is actually good for an action flick. I could do without the "Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head" sequence, but I realize it is needed to show how the weight of the world has been lifted from Parker as he temporarily tries to disown his work as Spider-Man. The pizza delivery is pretty cool; and the train fight is pulse pounding. Of course, the close-ups of Dunst also do something for me.Also in the cast are:J.K. Simmons, Daniel Gillies and the hot Venessa Ferlito. And for continuity there are the cameos of Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson. Spider-Man 2 should please children of all ages... from six to ninety-six.']
