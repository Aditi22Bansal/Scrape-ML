["Spoilers herein.Here we have two of the most outrageous muggers of modern film: Pacino with full HooHaa and DeNiro dragging his biggest grimace.Obviously, this film was first conceived with the two facing each other at the diner, to be followed by a massive shootout. Give everyone women problems. Fill in the rest with some Mann repeats and heist mechanics. The result is incoherent, simply jelly to stick some episodes together.\nSome of these are tolerable -- any of the scenes with Diane Venora or Jon Voigt. Venora knows how to be outside and inside at the same time. Everything else is TeeVee hash.That's because Pacino and DeNiro have just given up trying. Their `method' is to find the character in themselves, which is NOT method acting, at least the Brando style. The problem is simply that these two actors are not interesting people, far less interesting than their characters might be.\nTed's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with your time."]
