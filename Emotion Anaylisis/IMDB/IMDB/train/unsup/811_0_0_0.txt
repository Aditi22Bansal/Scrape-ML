["I like the striking production values, the music which is infectious and somewhat sexy and the acting of Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral and Chris Noth. Otherwise, I am not a fan of this show. I find the characters shallow especially at the start, the writing clich√©d and unfunny with the over-analysis on relationships often making me cringe and the stories predictable and uneven in pace-often on the dull side.Overall, I can understand both sides. I can understand why those may find it addictive, but I can also understand why people find it shallow. I'm not a fan, as much as I did try to like it. 4/10 Bethany Cox"]
