["But it's more than that! The story is great, the actors enjoy their roles. And so will you, if you watch the movie! The movie has many players, but still concentrates on one central one (George Clooney's) for your attention. But I was a little bit surprised that Don Cheadle is not listed in the credits (according to IMDb) ...It's style and funny dialogues from beginning to the end. Andy Garcia is a great villain here too. Someone you like to see fall down. But the question is, does he? You'll have to see the movie for that. Be excited, be very excited! Especially if you know the Original (with Frank Sinatra and others), because this movie is an example, that a remake can in fact not only be as good as the Original, but be even better! Watch it and you'll see! :o)"]
