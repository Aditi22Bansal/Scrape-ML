['It\'s funny at first but focuses on story pretty quickly, and the funny turns into fun.The characters are alright, they\'re fun and (intentionally) diverse, the actors are good but the acting is too Hollywoody and cued. Other series pull off a more genuine atmosphere. In a sense it\'s practically more of a (very long) play.\nSpecial mention out to Ted Danson (Michael) in particular who\'s absolutely seamless. Very underrated actor. And "Janet" is quite a creative, talented actress; and the character certainly one of the best elements here and adds a lot to the comedy and quality of the show.The series does well early on seizing the attention of the viewer as it unpacks its roller-coaster of a tale with seemingly endless twists and surprises. Ironically, the twist-laden first couple of seasons seem to stuff the viewer to the point where nothing seems surprising or unexpected anymore, and it could be said the first couple of seasons defeat the last couple of seasons at that. The end seems a bit nihilistic all in all, and somehow, that doesn\'t come as a surprise given the everything goes tone of the series.The subtext is appreciable at times, but the socio-political/religious implications certainly less. Why can\'t shows just be fun and tell a good story without underlying socio-politically tainted commentary ?']
