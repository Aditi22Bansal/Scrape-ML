["This cartoon series has everything you'd want - memorable characters, funny gags and insightful stories. Each episode is like a window into American society and it shows so much about different areas of our lives. The characters themselves are so fleshed out that it's like we know then personally, which leads to some very personal and emotional moments at times."]
