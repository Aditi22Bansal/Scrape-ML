['There have been many movies about a future dystopia, but "Blade Runner" is truly one of the best. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a cop looking for renegade replicants - robots designed to look like humans - in 21st century Los Angeles. As he travels through the city, we get to see how it looks: it rains constantly, there\'s nothing but advertising everywhere, and everything is totally paved over. Grim yes, but not as grim as some of the experiences that Deckard has throughout the movie. Ridley Scott gives the movie a setting as grim as the one in "Alien". You can\'t really say whether a person is supposed to feel cynical, fearful, or whatever while watching this movie, but it is definitely a movie that everyone should see.']
