["One of my favorite shows is on the air since 1963, more than half of a century. I followed it till December 2015 when they decided to skip 2016. I turned to some other shows and forgot about it. Season 2017 is over and in a month season 2018 begins. So last night I got back to it and reminded myself why I love it so much. In meantime I started original series and saw first two out of 26 seasons. It is good, but it's not quite it. Since 2005 Doctor Who becomes one of the best series ever. I will see all of it sooner or later, but only when I'm done with new seasons. To TV series fanatics with lots of spare time I warmly recommend all 37 seasons, but this last 11 seasons are must watch for every TV series fan.10/10"]
