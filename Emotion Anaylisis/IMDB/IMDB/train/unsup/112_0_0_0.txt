['maybe, not the best movie about Shoah. but the most useful. because it reminds the small details who are bricks of normality. and it does that in a wise manner. far to be one of fans of film, it seems be a real high good job. but it presents , in beautiful manner, a side of tragedy. a not large part of a phenomenon who shows its fruits but not its deep roots. a duty of Spielberg to his people, a remarkable photography and a touching story, it is a must see not for the story, artistic virtues, memorable scenes, splendid performances but for not ignore the evil. because it is not a film about Jews or a courageous man who saves innocent people , not about war but about the science to be yourself in dark periods. a film who must see. for reflection. for not ignore. the past. the vulnerability of society face to evil.']
