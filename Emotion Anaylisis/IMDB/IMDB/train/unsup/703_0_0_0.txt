['We were not able to watch this when it was originally broadcast but my wife and I have been watching it now, 2017, via HULU online streaming. When we watch it we usually watch 2 consecutive episodes, sort of like watching a movie.We just finished season 2 and now have started on season 3. The theme of the series is terrorist threats to the USA homeland after the attacks of 9-11. The main character is Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, CIA agent. Often brilliant, often inappropriate, a highly flawed individual who is always focused on her job, tracking down terrorists and foiling their plots. Sometimes she is successful, sometimes not.Her boss is Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, always a calming influence. In seasons 1 and 2 much of the focus is on British actor Damian Lewis doing a real good American accent as Marine Nicholas Brody, captured by terrorists abroad for 8 years, presumed dead by many including his wife and two children. When he returns as a Muslim the running question is whether he is legit or whether he has become a terrorist also, waiting for the opportunity to take out significant targets.Those 3 actors in those 3 characters make the series interesting. Especially the erratic behavior of Mathison. Danes really is one of the best female actors currently, anyone who missed her performance as Temple Grandin really should look it up.']
