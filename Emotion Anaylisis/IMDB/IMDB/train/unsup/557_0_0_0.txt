["When The Big Bang Theory premiered three years ago, I was certainly skeptical since it came from the creators of Two and A Half-Men (one of the worst comedies on TV ever). However, since then, it has proved to be one of the best comedies on Television.The ensemble cast is amazing, quite amazing in every way. Johnny Galecki is a true comedy lead star, and Kaley Cuoco has gotten better since her 8 Simple Rules days. However, as great as the cast is, the shining star here is Jim Parsons. He has created one of the funniest, most obscure and interesting characters I have ever seen in a sitcom, thanks in large part to the writing and to his magnificent portrayal. It is evident that he holds the show together.Overall, this is a very likable comedy series, that while it started off so-so, has gotten better and better and has proved it's greatness over the years."]
