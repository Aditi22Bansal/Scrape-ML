["New Girl has made a star of actress Zooey Deschanel. She plays Jess, a teacher who moves in with three male friends in a loft warehouse. I caught this show on and off for the last three seasons. This show is quirky sometimes more so and can be either annoying or charming. The show isn't filmed in front of the audience and done on location in Los Angeles, California. I love Max Greenfields Schmidt character who is playing a Don Draper type character. I don't know how long this show will go on in seasons. Zooey is talented and charming as Jess. But we know sitcoms have a shorter life expectancy than dramas. I relate to Jess in some parts."]
