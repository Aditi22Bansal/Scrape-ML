["Pixar makes a cartoon about depression and it is aimed at kids.Riley is a happy 11 year old girl whose parents have moved from Minnesota to San Francisco. Being apart from her friends and her hockey team has upset the balance of her her core memories and five emotions of Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling.) Joy is the main controlling factor in Riley's life.It is Sadness though that threatens to unbalance Riley and in the turmoil the two emotions of Joy and Sadness get moved to her Long Term Memory compartment. This leaves Fear, Disgust, and Anger in charge of her brain, the Headquarter and they do not know how to control Riley now she is in her new school in the big city. Riley gets moody withdrawn and sad. Her parents worry that their sweet little child has gone.Joy and Sadness need to find a way back to the Headquarter before permanent damage is done to Riley and they do this with the of a childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind.)This is a multi layered story shown in a colourful and frenetic way. Kids would enjoy that side of it. However Inside Out is also a bittersweet film. While I appreciated the cerebral subtext of the film, as a feature length cartoon the story did feel clunky at times."]
