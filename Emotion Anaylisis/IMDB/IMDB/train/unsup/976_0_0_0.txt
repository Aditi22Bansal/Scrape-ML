['In "Designated Survivor", Kiefer Sutherland plays Tom Kirkman, the Secretary of HUD who is sworn in as President when the U.S. Capitol is bombed and the leaders of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches are killed.When voters evaluate Vice Presidential candidates, they consider how they might fill the presidential role, but no one evaluates the Secretary of HUD that way. One of Kirkman\'s first tasks is to project authority and adequacy. Sutherland\'s usual whisper-talking has a gravitas that is suitable for this problem.The show deals with the problems within Kirkman\'s family, who are moved into the White House immediately. It also deals with the struggles within government as Washington tries to regain equilibrium, political and otherwise. Lastly, the bombing has spurred challenges to American authority and resolve on a global level. Can Kirkman respond to these challenges? The irony is that he may be better suited than the two major candidates now running for the Presidency in the real world.Though conflicts and crises often unite people, the situation on "Designated Survivor"--being focused on Washington D.C.--quickly devolves into political gamesmanship, unprincipled and illegal, though totally believable.The acting on this show is excellent. My one wish is that the show can maintain a viewpoint that is not politically biased. After three episodes, it has done a fair job of that.']
