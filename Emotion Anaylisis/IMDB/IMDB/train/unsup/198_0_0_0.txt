["Either you love it or you hate it. K(Tommy Lee Jones) and J(Will Smith)are top-secret government agents, investigating alien visitations on Earth, who must stop an alien terrorist(Vincent D'Onofrio)from causing an intergalactic disaster. Witty and amazing insect-type aliens steal the show. F/X are superb. Also in the cast are Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub and the alluring Linda Fiorentino. Sci-Fi takes on a different look."]
