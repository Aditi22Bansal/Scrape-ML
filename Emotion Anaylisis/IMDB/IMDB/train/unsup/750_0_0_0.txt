['\'The Sinner\' is a strange drama, rather over-constructed. A woman commits an inexplicable crime, and has seemingly neither any understanding of what she has done, nor apparent interest in getting to the bottom of the case. But a detective, with relationship problems of his own, is interested, and eventually uncovers the story of her awful history and thereby explains the crime. But there\'s little feeling of urgency to the drama, little emotional connection to the characters and sadly little plausibility as well. It feels like someone was trying too hard to make a "psychological" thriller; but forgot that our psychological motivations are often most interesting when at their subtlest.']
