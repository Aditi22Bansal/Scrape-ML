['I won\'t begin to describe the situation, you have a synopsis for that. I want to focus on the experience itself.First, the film has the look and feel of a graphic novel. This should please fans of the book even if the film strays, or has to condense a lot of back story in a small time, as it appeared to do in the opening sequence.The visual effects were stunning, and the music and sound track were superb. Any film that includes Leonard Cohen singing "Hallelujah" has got me.Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach was a joy to watch, as was Malin Ã…kerman as Silk Spectre II.Now, I have to get the soundtrack.']
