["Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is a clever (if not too clever) film that showcases some good actors in a better than average cops and robbers movie. Unfortunately, Singer brings some flaws (not immense, after all, how would Christopher McQuarie win a Oscar for his screenplay is the film's flaws weren't immense). That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.Still, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for). Not bad Overall. B+"]
