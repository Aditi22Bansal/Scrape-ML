["At first glance I didn't know what to think but after watching the first episode and then following it, growing to love the characters in live-action form and getting addicted of the show I have to say it's one fine TV show. It's dark tone separates the animated show I watched as a kid and made this experience more mature and much more how I like shows now days, character driven stories with great character development and characters. Something the creators succeeded with is the characters, making them human and believable, Hank and Dawn was two of my favorites, well written and likeable. I also really liked Brenton Thwaites' portrayal of Dick Grayson, the brutal side of him was something that I didn't like at first but after watching I grew to love it.The choreography for the brutal fight scenes were one of the highlights, the brutal nature made it feel real. The other highlights are the characters and story, the dark tone of the story is something original, I found it very enjoyable with following the Titans on their journey."]
