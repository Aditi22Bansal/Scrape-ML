["I had originally given this show a 10/10 and have not missed an episode since day one.Everything about this show started out perfect - directing, writing, cinematography, sfx, acting, etc.My problem now is that the writing has been getting sloppy. You start getting to know certain characters, they become integral in the plot, then you don't see them for (+/-) half the season. What's worse is that from where they left off and when they come back, there's no explanation for the missing timeline. E.g. Erin Richards' character and especially Jada Pinkett Smith's character. We see Fish Money at the end of a season finale and then vanishes the next.For that reason I've dropped my score to a 9/10. I really hope the sloppy writing improves again."]
