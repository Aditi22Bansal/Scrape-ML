["So enjoyable watching Dean and Sam experience everything bizarre or mysterious! Some hit or miss episodes that were meh then others that gave me the best feeling ever that make me definitely want to keep watching the journey. CW has quite a few shows I wouldn't recommend/ care where as Supernatural is amazing and the story tends to always have more excitement around the corner! The music couldn't be better, so much epicness to purify the soul."]
