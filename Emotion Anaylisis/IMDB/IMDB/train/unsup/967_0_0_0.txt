['I won\'t spend any time here discussing the horrible way this show was marketed and broadcast--resulting in an early cancellation--except to say that I was one of the original viewers and I felt betrayed."Firefly" is my favorite television show of all time.The basic premise bears some resemblance to "Star Wars", but FF does it better. The music is great, the production values are great, the set of the ship is fantastic. The cast is terrific. But what really makes this show is the writing. The characters are truly developed and nuanced, far from one-dimensional. The plots are intriguing and different. The universe of FF expands throughout the first season.The guest stars deserve special mention. There were many portrayals worthy of Emmy nods (hello, Christina Hendricks!). Joss Whedon had created such a wonderful first season, if the show had continued, there were so many story lines to build on. I think FF would have been an Emmy factory.']
