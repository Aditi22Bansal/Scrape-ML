["GET OUT is a well-regarded modern-day American horror film that looks at race relations in an outlandish way. Styistically, it's similar to the likes of IT FOLLOWS, very well shot throughout and with an emphasis on the reactions of the actors involved rather than telling the story through flashy narration or fast editing. In terms of the story, I found it quite predictable, and it does seem to drag out the mystery endlessly at the outset when it's quite obvious what's going on. However, the ending certainly pays off and some finely-judged performances from the lead actors make this a satisfying viewing experience overall."]
