['"Justified" had real promise when it first started. It wasn\'t just a cop show, but also a bit of a Western. with old-fashioned lawman Raylan Givens chasing down modern fugitives. He\'s kind of a dick, but the best kind: a charming one. And Timothy Olyphant was (is) perfect for this role. But just beyond that first season, the show became serialized and blossomed into an honest-to-god crime drama. This is exactly why it became one of my all-time favorite TV shows; it was quietly riveting week-in and week-out. But it was also a world full of entertaining characters and a cast to match. Walton Goggins proved to be Olyphant\'s equal as his primary opposition (and a show highlight), and this Kentucky underworld is one I often couldn\'t wait to return to. Put simply, it\'s an Elmore Leonard joint, complete with his ear- candy dialog and offbeat characters; and that\'s enough for me. But they went and made it one of the funniest, engaging and rewarding shows I\'ve ever seen. 10/10']
