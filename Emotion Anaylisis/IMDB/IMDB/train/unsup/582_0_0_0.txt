["Since the dawn of television, serialized series have been quite popular with audiences. It peaked when JR was shot nearly 40 years ago and has survived VHS, cable, and streaming and video games. 24 made it real innovative with its real time episodes set in an hour (with commercials). Then in 2004, ABC kicked off its hit season with Desperate Housewives and Lost. Created by the same guy who made Jennifer Garner a sex icon in Alias, Lost is about a crew of plane passengers that crash into an island trying to find their way home. LIke seinfeld, the series finale is not as good as other finales but concludes the most confusing tv storyline ever made. I remember watching part of the two hour season premiere which at the time was the most expensive TV pilot ever made until Game of Thrones broke that record. I had a crush on Evangeline Lilly before she became the wasp as well as other movie roles and the way it was shot and sounded like felt like a movie. Even the title is very twilight zoneish. It's available to watch for free on IMDB TV as well as on Hulu, so watch all seven seasons if you dare."]
