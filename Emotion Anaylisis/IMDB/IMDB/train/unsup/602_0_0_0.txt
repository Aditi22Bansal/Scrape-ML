["Everything having to do with going against society and conspiracies I crave! Mr. Robot is incredibly filmed, written, and has such an exciting soundtrack! I absolutely love the vibes I get from all the excellent things that happen throughout. Some of the best suspense ever and profound quotes/speeches. Rami Malek has become one of my favorite actors to watch and I have enjoyed Christian Slater quite a lot. I can't wait till I can own season 4 like I own the other seasons."]
