["I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox."]
