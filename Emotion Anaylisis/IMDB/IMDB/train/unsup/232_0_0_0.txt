['Well many would strongly disagree. But this is not about the quality of this sequel (some even suggesting this being superior than the first movie, that\'s not my decision to make), it is about one of the characters spewing many memorable quote. Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That\'s another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into "reality".But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie. Effects are great, cast is amazing, some communication devices have dated though. Also a nice spin on the android-phobia from the first movie throughout the movie. Really well thought out and well made, one of the best sequels to an arguable classic']
