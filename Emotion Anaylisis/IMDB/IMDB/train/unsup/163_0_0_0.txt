["M.C. Duncan steals the picture with a tremendous supporting performance as a black gentleman, accused of murdering two children, who has a gift to heal people. No, he is not Elmer Gantry, but you know that he couldn't be guilty of such a crime by his very demeanor.An elderly man tells the story to a woman in a nursing home of when he was a guard some 60+ years before.We meet a whole assortment of condemned prisoners as well as one of the guards who is as sadistic as they come.Tom Hanks is grand as the young guard who shows compassion for the inmates.The film is also definitely one exposing the horrors of the death penalty.There is a fine supporting cast as well with Patricia Clarkson, a grossly under-rated actress, doing a stunning turn as a woman dying of a brain tumor.The film gets even better when a chain of events allows practically everyone to get what they deserved with the exception of the Duncan character."]
