['So the whole damn "Harry Potter" thing finally ends, only to leave me wondering: if Professor McGonagall could shoot fire out of her wand and muster up a whole army of suited knights all along, why didn\'t she do it a whole hell of a lot sooner? And there lies my problem with the entire movie series. If you didn\'t read the books, which I didn\'t, you don\'t understand the story\'s logic half the time. Apparently it\'s all well explained by J.K. Rowling, but if so, the filmmakers did a bad job of transferring her explanations to the screen.All of the movies suffer from laziness, and "Deathly Hallows Part 2," while much better, almost by default, than "Deathly Hallows Part 1," is no exception. It assumes that the series\' die-hard fans will fill in the blanks the filmmakers are too bored to fill in for us, so key moments, like the standoff between McGonagall and Snape, or the one between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange, just sit there on the screen instead of causing us to leap to our feet in excitement.Let\'s just say I\'m looking forward to reading the books with my sons when they\'re old enough. Maybe then the whole story will make more sense.Grade: B']
