["Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool."]
