['A very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order. But while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It takes its time and while you might wish there was more personality behind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the "other" voice (Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you\'re watching this in the original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost everything than the actual human being.The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this "romance" (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie is not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is anyone who is to blame one way or another, it\'s the person using the technology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I meant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this movie. Enjoy this trip with some very interesting ideas']
