["If you are a fan of the popular comics about the mutant super heroes, then you'll love this movie. It is mainly focused on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who meets outcast mutant Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin) and they both go to a secret place which has all young and old mutants studying, and of course, the headquarters of The X-Men. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier, the commander of The X-Men, he believes that Rogue and Wolverine can be part of the team, along with Jean Grey (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry). Meanwhile, the evil Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) along with Toad (Ray Park), Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and the gorgeous Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) want to find Wolverine and make him part of his team. Personally, the second film's better. Good!"]
