['I watched the first episode of this, which only had 2-3 stupid bits of writing in it, and the actors played reasonably well, although a bit clichéd in body language and style. The concept is pretty obvious, has been done before many times (Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte in 48 hours, etc) but there is nothing wrong with the concept.So I bought episode 2, and watched about 1/3 of it. Clearly, the writers are either different, or were intellectually exhausted by the pilot. There are so many things wrong here, so many caricatures and clichés, so many plot holes and stupid behaviour on the part of the "good guys". Do Americans really like this? Why is it so many many people here vote this up above 8.0? Truly I am amazed.AVOID THIS SHOW.']
