['Death, where is thy sting?This well-written and well-acted show presents us with death from the perspective of a family-run funeral home. There is a Shakespearian element of having the ghosts of the corpses come and talk to the living characters. Chief amongst these is the patriarch of the family who has periodic conversations with his wife, daughter, and two sons.From zany fake commercials for mortician products to deadly serious issues such as hate-crime, the show has a wonderful range of moods and stories.']
