['I must warn you a bit about "Big Little Lies". This HBO series is very violent, with vivid depictions of domestic violence. It also has a lot of nudity. In addition, the show is one that EASILY could overwhelm viewers...especially those who have been through domestic violence and rape. A tough show....but an amazing one. So, if you\'re inviting over Father O\'Malley or your mother, you might just want to think twice about seeing this one with them.The series is about three women in Monterey, California....a very expensive and swank town to live in, though not quite as swank as nearby Carmel. Regardless, the story centers on these women as well as the men and children in their lives...as well as their \'friends\' who are mostly social climbing back-biters and jerks. I could say so much more about the plot....suffice to say it\'s exquisitely written and has some of the best acting you could ever hope to see. Considering there are tons of reviews about the series already, I\'ll just end it here with an admonition to watch the show...it\'s sensational.By the way, as a trained therapist and ex-social worker, I really appreciated the writing of this show. Their portrayal of domestic violence as well as how a therapist works were both spot on and I appreciate this.']
