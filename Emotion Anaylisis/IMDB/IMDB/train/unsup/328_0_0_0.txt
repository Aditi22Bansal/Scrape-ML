['This film is about four magicians who team up to perform the most spectacular magical heists ever seen in history."Now You See Me" tells the story of how four magicians perform the unbelievable heists while on stage, such as robbing a bank in Paris while they are on stage in Las Vegas. They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it\'s magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic."Now You See Me" is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza. It kept me amazed and engaged throughout, and I enjoyed every second of it.']
