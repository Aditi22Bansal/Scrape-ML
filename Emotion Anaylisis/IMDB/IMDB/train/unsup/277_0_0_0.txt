['Star Wars Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace (1999) * 1/2 (out of 4) I thought the first three films were great even though I\'m certainly not a fan or anything but this sucker here was just horrid all around. Thankfully the thing got bad enough to where I could just sit back and laugh at it but without the laughs and the nice pod chase then this here would have been without any merit. The dialogue was insane and it\'s hard to believe any of the actors kept a straight face but I\'d go also say the poor dialogue made most of the cast just milk their performance. All of the "stars" in this film have given plenty of great performances throughout their careers but they\'re all bad here, especially Portman who\'s on of my favorite actresses. Whoever played the young Luke was also terrific but at least I got several laughs out of him.']
