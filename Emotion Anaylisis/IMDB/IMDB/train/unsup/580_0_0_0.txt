['You know that feel when one foot fell asleep and you try to "bring it back to life"? That\'s what happened to my brain every time I tried to endure an episode of The Handmaid\'s Tale while figuring out why this show gets so much approval. Diagnosis: one of those shows or movies who are praised for their message only - the quality of the other parameters (story, production, directing, acting and so on) are then a completely irrelevant matter, because you know, the message is important ;)']
