["I remember this being so unique and cool when it first came out, and it still gives off the same vibes today. The action and CGI are amazing, the acting is well done, the actors and robots are well cast. It's a Micheal Bay movie, so of course it's just a bit too long. But the action keeps amped up throughout the entire movie. A one of a kind action/robot movie. Auto bots, roll out."]
