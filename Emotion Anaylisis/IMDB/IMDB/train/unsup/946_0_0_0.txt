['But this season truly was outstanding. It\'s been such an amazing year for TV, and I think this, Mad Men, Fargo, and Hannibal all stand on top of the drama pack in terms of their last seasons. I get why Hannibal won\'t make a splash with the Emmys, but how didn\'t Season 1 of this and how will it not again? Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are giving some of the finest TV acting, especially Russell. The characterization and plotting of this season is pretty impressive. Season 1\'s emotional core was the Jennings\' marriage, and this season was their relationship with their children, more specifically Paige. Seeing the new doors that the finale opened up, I can\'t wait for the next season. The show\'s truly found a perfect balance between all of the "thrilling" stuff and everything else around it, it never feels bogged down and it always gives enough emphasis to the characterization, in a way that could really test people\'s patience. Also, no other current show does musical montages like this one. Season Grade- AAlso, the ratings for this seem to be pretty awful, how the hell did it get renewed for another season? Regardless, I\'ll take it!']
