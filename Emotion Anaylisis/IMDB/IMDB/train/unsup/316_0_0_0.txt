["The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever."]
