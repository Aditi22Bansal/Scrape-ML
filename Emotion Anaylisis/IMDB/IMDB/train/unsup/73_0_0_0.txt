['What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary \'Eggsy\' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world\'s population. If it had been less "dirty" it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.DVD from my public library.']
