['Upon first learning of the AMC series "The Killing" I was a little confused since Stanley Kubrick directed a heist-themed movie with that title. But this is a really impressive series. Adapted from the Danish series "Forbrydelsen", it focuses on a Seattle police detective (Mireille Enos) investigating a murder amid a political campaign. Various and sundry secondary and tertiary characters assist in the investigation. There\'s a little bit more revealed on each episode, but never so much that it gives away the whole plot. The result is a very good show. I do hope to see the original Danish series.* *Other US series based on foreign series were "All in the Family", "Sanford and Son" and "Ugly Betty".']
