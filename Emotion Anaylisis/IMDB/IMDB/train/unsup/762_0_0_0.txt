["Scrubs is a show with 4 main leads but really it's the overall ensemble that makes it the great show that it is.The leads were J.D., Turk, Carla and Elliot. But you also had The Janitor, Kelso, Cox, The Todd, Nurse Laverne, Jordan, Snoop Dogg Intern and Dr. Beardface which helped makes the show so great. The characters play off of each other perfectly. The series wasn't afraid to poke fun at its main characters, like J.D. always drinking his Appletinis.After so many serious hospital shows like ER, Chicago Hope, St. Elsewhere, Hawthorne(which were all great shows), it's still nice to see a doctor show that doesn't take itself so serious. Not to say they made the doctors out to be clowns since they still really cared about their patients and saving them but they brought along humor to lighten the load when need be."]
