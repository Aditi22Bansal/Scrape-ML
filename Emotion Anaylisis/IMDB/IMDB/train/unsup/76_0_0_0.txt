['At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what\'s funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I\'ll just say colorful sprinkle, you\'ll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this "getting out of hand", being unrealistic/over the top.But that\'s it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it\'s always on some other level "flying" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don\'t mind this being "British" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you\'ll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing']
