['"Independence Day" is essentially one big cliché after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie. The story is generic and predictable, yes, but it still has a lot of entertainment value. And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie cliché and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie. The spaceships were a nice design. But the aliens, both in and out of their exo-suits were really impressive, and they alone make it fun to watch the movie."Independence Day" is a star-filled movie, boasting talents such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Viviva A. Fox, James Rebhorn, Brent Spinner and many more. People did good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is a fun and fast-paced movie that is well-worth watching if you enjoy action Sci-Fi movies, just look past the American propaganda and endless clichés. Take it for what it is; an enjoyable action Sci-Fi movie.']
