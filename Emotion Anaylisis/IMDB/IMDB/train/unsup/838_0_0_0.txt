["Spartacus (Andy Whitfield/Liam McIntyre) was a Thracian who refused to fight after being lied to by Roman commander Claudius Glaber. He is enslaved as well as his wife Sura. He is eventually purchased by Batiatus (John Hannah) as he is thrown into the world gladiators. The house of Batiatus is full of intrigue led in part by his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless). He would rebel and bring Rome to the brink.It's a Starz production. It's blood splattering gore. It's full on sexuality. The violence is over the top. The fights are slow motion poetry. The story is human depravity at its finest. The show took a look at any restrictions and laughed at its face. The first season ends with the breakout of the House of Batiatus. Andy Whitfield was Spartacus. However he got sick, and the show next did a six-part prequel without Whitfield. When he died, the show continues with Liam McIntyre as Spartacus.If this was a simple exploitation fare, I wouldn't rate it so high. The story is just so fun. John Hannah and Lucy Lawless really have a lot of fun playing the devious duo. The twists and turns come fast and furious. It's like an earlier 'Game of Thrones' with more nudity. The last season is hamstrung by the fact that it's history that Spartacus dies."]
