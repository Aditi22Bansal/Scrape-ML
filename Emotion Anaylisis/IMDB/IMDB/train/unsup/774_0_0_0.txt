["I gave this three seasons.It started out OK, in the first episode it looked like we had a strong heroine. That ended with the start of the second episode.From episode two on through the end of the third season the plot line falls back to the old damsel in distress clich√©. Sookie gets in trouble, Bill &/or Sam rushes to save here. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.But there's more. Every character is a cry baby. Even the villains. It's a series written for the emo crowd. It appeals to One specific part of the American culture: You know that one guy at the party, that guy in the skinny jeans, with the effeminate hair-cut that guy that for some unknown reason has an emotional melt down & crumbles into the fetal position to cry his eyes out while everyone else is having a good time.Yeah. The show is written for that guy. For that crowd.Don't be part of the crowd.Pick up the remote control & change the channel before the show gets into your psyche & you start crying over spilled milk."]
