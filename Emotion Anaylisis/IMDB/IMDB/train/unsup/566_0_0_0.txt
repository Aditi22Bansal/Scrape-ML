['After hearing the departure of Matt Smith, as there will be somebody that will play yet another witty doctor. As Doctor Who is as old as any of us can count.Show has wit, charm, and knows when to be serious and when to be funny. Anybody who plays the doctor, knows that you have to have humor, be a great actor, and really know the emotions of the character.I grew up with the Tom Baker episodes. And kind of had a crush on him with those curls and offering jelly beans. When I lived as a kid in Fla. But still, no matter who plays the doctor, it will keep on continuing.Hats off to the longest ever BBC show in their history. Keep on doing what you are doing.']
