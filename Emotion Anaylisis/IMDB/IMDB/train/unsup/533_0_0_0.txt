["At least it has Simon Pegg in it, who Hugh was based on. And I kind of can't picture the show without his involvement.It's not as Garth Ennis as I think it should be, it's not as vulgar and offensive and fun as he usually is, and certainly as The Boys was in print... but it comes really close to making that mark, and that is a breath of fresh air given the way that both comic books, and the movies they are based on are going.Ultimately, it's still vulgar, offensive, bloody and funny, even if it could have been more.And it's only 8 episodes, which seems a lot like they aren't trying to drag the story out just to add more, and that is also refreshing.Ultimately, it's a cure for modern comics in a very late 90s British Invasion kind of way"]
