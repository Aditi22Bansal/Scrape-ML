["The first Spiderman film was good fun, and managed the rare feat of appealing to both comic book fans and just people who want n entertaining film with a good story when they go to the cinema.This third outing though is so bogged down by what has gone before that it takes a good hour before the plot really kicks in. I know there were plans for a 'Spiderman 4' with the same cast, but it does feel at times like the director is trying to tie up all the loose ends.Maguire and Dunst do well in their roles as ever, and what's nice is that various people who have appeared across the series return.It's a decent film, albeit one that like many sequels before it is trying to do far too much."]
