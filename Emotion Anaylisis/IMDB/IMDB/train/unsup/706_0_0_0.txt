["Actually my mother was a fan before I became one of this show. I can't wait to see it regularly in syndication. The chemistry between CHarlie Sheen and Jon Cryer is absolutely perfect. The Harper brothers are both opposites. The casting of Angus Jones as Charlie's son Jake is quite brilliant. He is so naturally funny to watch on the show. I love seeing Holland Taylor but we don't see enough of her as their domineering, critical mother who could put Marie Barone to shame. She's not that kind of mother who will bake cookies and take her grandson to the zoo. She's a more contemporary grandmother. Anyway it's great to see Conchetta Farrell as the maid, Bert. She's more than just the maid, her timing is just about perfect. I love seeing Melanie Lynskey who I didn't recognize from Heavenly Creatures as lovesick stalker of Alan Harper and neighbor. Her role of Rose is not to be ignored at all. She is quite the up and coming actress. I would have never guessed that she was a New Zealander herself. There is no trace of a Kiwi accent. The show itself has come along way from the beginning and I hope to see more in the future."]
