['Hugh Laurie master of being head doctor, jerk, sophisticated, and quirky! This show is so enjoyable it gives me goosebumps often. House M.D. is so well done very much deserves the 2 Emmys earned. Filled with complex circumstances that are bumpy with many accurate or mishaps but more wins than not throughout. The characters go through a lot which is intriguing and always entertaining! Even the simple patients are always worth seeing. I love the show and all interesting facts around it!']
