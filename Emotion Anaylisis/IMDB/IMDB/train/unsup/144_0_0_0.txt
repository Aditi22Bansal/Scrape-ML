["An extremely complex structure/movie, that might be too much for some people. Too much information, a too confusing plot line, not enough action, too slow a pace. All things that could be said about this movie. But it's still gripping. Even if you don't get what it means, after watching it the first time (I didn't), it still is a mesmerizing experience.In a time-line that doesn't seem clear, in a world that looks like ours, but feels entirely different, this movie gets its strength from the plot, which as well can be it's weak point for many. If you're not appalled to the strange, feel free to experience this movie ..."]
