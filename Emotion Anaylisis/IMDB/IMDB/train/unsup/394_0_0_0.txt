["This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience."]
