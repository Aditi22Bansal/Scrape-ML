['Actually, it\'s better than the first!First off, see "Fellowship of the Ring" or you won\'t be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There\'s battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn\'t impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can\'t wait for "Return of the King"!']
