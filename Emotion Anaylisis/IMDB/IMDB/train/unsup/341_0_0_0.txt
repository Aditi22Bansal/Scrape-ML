["Utterly inane farce about a princess who has the ability to keep things mighty cold and lead her kingdom into what is described as perpetual winter. This almost leads to tragedy for her sister and causes the former to go into a self-imposed exile while her kingdom freezes over.Funny that this tale of woe ends with the queen never getting a guy while the sister had two opportunities. Treachery abounds and it's shocking to see who is involved in this evil. Of course, there are parents, the king and queen who are lost at sea to bring further misery and mayhem to the situation.The singing voices,especially by Idina Menzel are wonderful and the songs are catchy."]
