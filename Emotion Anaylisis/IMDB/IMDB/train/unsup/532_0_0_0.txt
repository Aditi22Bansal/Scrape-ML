['Funny enough got into show twice , first when aired on TV and. Got to end of mid season 2 as life gets in the way , I lost track and could not get into it.Early in the year I got Netflix and got back into there series . I would say first 2 season were the best,Season 3 and rest were really enjoyable and great to watch and the sone if final season shocked me to core.Lao msny great twist and turns that I did. Not see coming , which kept me on toes to see the next episodes.There were nights I could stop watching ep after after ep and bad gripped.I liked the first al season of the show , I was not to sure what to make if the ending at all I did not love but I did not hate either']
