["21 JUMP STREET (2012) *** Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle,Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, Nick Offerman, Caroline Aaron, Joe Chrest. (Cameos: Holly Robinson Peete, Peter DeLuise, Johnny Depp) . Big-screen adaptation of the cult classic '80s TV series gets the comic overload reboot with Hill & Tatum as former high school nemeses who find themselves in the police and faced with undercover duty back to school to infiltrate a new drug pusher whose wares are causing some alarm. Better-than-anticipated yet still stupidly funny the film is far more entertaining than it should be thanks largely to the comic duo's chemistry and shrewdly incorporating the stars of the series in fun cameos. Hill, who co-scripted with Michael Bacall, executive produced with Tatum as well and Phil Lord & Chris Miller's forays from animation clearly evidence for the live-action shenanigans suggesting a Looney Tunes short at times. Nice chase scene with non-exploding vehicles as a tongue-thru-cheek attitude prevailed throughout makes a loser into a winner."]
