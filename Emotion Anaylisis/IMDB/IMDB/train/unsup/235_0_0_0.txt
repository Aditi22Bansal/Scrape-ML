['Let\'s start from the actors. We have Uma Thurman (a great role for her to display her "power"), we have the recently deceased David Carradine getting a chance to shine one more time. Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let\'s loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she\'s doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It\'s a shame, because quite a few things were promised. But then again, the "Grindhouse" experience hasn\'t hit home cinemas either ... we\'ll keep on waiting then ...']
