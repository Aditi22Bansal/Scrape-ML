['Had they toned down the sarcasm, and flip attitude, this might have been watchable. I tried hard to get through the first season, but the incessant attempts to be humorous were brittle, not funny, and wore me out. It took the fun out of what was a great premise, and though I love this genre, I could not get past episode four.Also, the woman lead was a bit too "me too". She had zero connection with her femininity, and way too much shame about appearing semi nude in a show that took place years ago. She was essentially playing a good looking man.This could have been so much better.']
