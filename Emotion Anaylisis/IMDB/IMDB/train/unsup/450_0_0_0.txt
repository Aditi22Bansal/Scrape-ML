["The Walking Dead, up until after the Season 7 premiere, was a show that I looked forward to every week. It was a really well done drama with great performances from the whole cast, walkers included. This did not just apply to a handful of the main cast because some great characters came and went. Every time we lost a good character, we most often were introduced to a just as good if not better character. Not only that, but it was faithful to the themes of the comic books. The only downside was the quality of the CGI effects, but that's understandable seeing as how it is a cable show and probably does not have the same budget as say Game of Thrones. However, this doesn't detract too much from the show. After the season 7 premiere, the show began to falter. The story arcs seemed way to stretched out of the point where a good half of the episodes were filler and it seemed like it lost its worrysome sense that anyone could go at anytime. However, Season 9 brought the show back to its roots in a sense. That danger became a reality once again and the episodes no longer felt like filler. If they keep up with this, the show could regain its footing it once had a few seasons prior."]
