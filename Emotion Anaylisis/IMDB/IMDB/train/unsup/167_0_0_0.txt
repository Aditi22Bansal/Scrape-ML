['Starting in 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) with the help and money from his roommate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) first create a website called "FaceMash" where pictures of female students are pitted against each other to create a ranking. This got him into trouble with the school, and recruited by Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) to work on their social networking site. However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as \'Facebook\' with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks.Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin. The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg. Fincher\'s directions infuse the movie with energy. And Garfield creates humanity in his character. This Zuckerberg is a stand-offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority. It is an unique character and an unique film.']
