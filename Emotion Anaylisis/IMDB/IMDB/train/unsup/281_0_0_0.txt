['Rewatching this I can\'t help but wonder: What would today be possible? In creating a world and havng someone in that world being oblivious about being just a pawn ... being a "prisoner" ... I\'m not sure I need the ", but you understand surely what I mean.I had watched this, but it was a long time ago, so it was interesting to rewatch this and understand how relevant this still is today. Or rather even more relevant than it was back then. The movie takes us into a town that is artificial ... to so many extras in a show ... I mean if you think about many things, there may be some issues (holes in the internal logic it has or hasn\'t, the father thing that seems to be a problem, just to almost be totally ignored towards the end, without any explanation - maybe deleted scenes?) .... but if you do not let those things muddle your impression/effect the movie has ... you will be more than entertained. It may even be able to make you question some of your own choices ... because after all, this is not just a stab at society in general, but also choices we make ... the limitations we set ourselves ... imprison us.A classic in so many ways - and showing that Jim Carey can do more than just being crazy ... he can actually act.']
