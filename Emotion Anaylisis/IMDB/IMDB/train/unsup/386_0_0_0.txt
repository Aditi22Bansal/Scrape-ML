['This Oscar winning film of 2012 is a true story dealing with the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-80, the ultimate crisis that made Jimmy Carter a one term president.Angered by the acceptance of the cancer stricken Shah of Iran to America, the Iranians invaded our embassy there and took many people hostage. The story deals with the attempt of our CIA launching a covert action to free the 6 people in the embassy who had fled at the time of its take-over and were granted asylum in the Canadian Embassy.The plot involves a phony movie production of "Argo," a phony film which would be used to get the six people out of the country.Alan Arkin and John Goodman really provided comic relief by working with our government to create this false attempt at movie making so as to fool the Iranians.As the 6 prepare to leave, tension builds in some very grueling scenes, as they appear to run into roadblocks in their attempt to flee the country.']
