['"Skyfall" is a good film and it made a buttload of money. Whether or not you love it will depend on how much you love stunts, explosions and chases. If you adore them and can\'t get enough of them, then this film is for you! It\'s more like "Die Hard" in many ways than a traditional James Bond film. As for me, I don\'t particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn\'t a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn\'t boring.I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don\'t feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it\'s a decent film but nothing more.']
