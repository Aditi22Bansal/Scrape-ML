['This film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreak.Shaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction. Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one.']
