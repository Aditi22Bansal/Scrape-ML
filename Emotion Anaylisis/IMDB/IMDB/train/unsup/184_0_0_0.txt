["An amazing and sad statement about American values, about having the courage to change your life totally when you feel you have nothing to lose, about finding out what's important just as it's too late.  A wow of a movie with so many dimensions, amplified by sensational performances. How can something be so depressing yet uplifting, be about parents who have screwed their lives up so horribly and yet give you hope that the young people have a chance to evolve?  I guess that's true genius."]
