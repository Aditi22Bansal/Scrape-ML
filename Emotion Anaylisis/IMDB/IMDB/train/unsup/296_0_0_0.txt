["Much style, but limited substance. Great special effects and decent initial plot. Story looked set to be quite interesting.However, from a point it just becomes hard to follow. The plot seems to take twists for twists sake, not much is explained, and nothing much follows from before. It just...happens, without rhyme nor reason.Ending was a tad predictable, but then that wasn't really the ending (one of the many wtf moments I had during the movie). Tom Cruise does his usual action-hero stuff. Does it well, but it's nothing new. Olga Kurylenko is stunningly beautiful, as always, and puts in a decent performance. Morgan Freeman seemed to be on autopilot (I guess he sensed from the start this movie was hardly going to demand much of his considerable acting talents). Disappointing."]
