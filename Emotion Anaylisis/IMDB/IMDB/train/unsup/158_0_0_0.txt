["DEADPOOL 2 is the sequel to the surprisingly funny superhero spoof starring Ryan Reynolds. Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed. The X-Men parallels are fun and the plot keeps you guessing, with a string of quirky supporting characters proving a match for our hero. Hardly a ground-breaking movie, but it does entertain and that's what matters."]
