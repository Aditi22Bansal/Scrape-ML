["I read some of the reviews and thought this might be worth watching. Perhaps it's time to put an age on reviewers ???the angst of an adolescent realising they aren't normal and are actually part human, and also a werewolf.sadly, it isn't... it's suitable for teens and sub teens... it's got the boy sees girl, girl likes boy and...it's all really predictable and lame...it's suitable for kids who like buffy etc... it's so not for adults... shame...the story lines don't develop and neither does the characterisation either...suitable for kids..."]
