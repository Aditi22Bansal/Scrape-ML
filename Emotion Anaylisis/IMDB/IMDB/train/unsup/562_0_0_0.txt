["I remember watching the American movie of Doctor Who years earlier but thats about it.For those who have no idea who the Doctor is; let me just say he has become a part of British culture, just like Bond.I didn't pay attention to the first series with Eccelston but during the second season I watched the episode 'Tooth and Claw' it had a dark and grim mood. Then the episode 'The girl in the fire place' was very dark and scary; it really shows how much a good script can do. The show has some great episodes and good villains; Tennant does the role justice even though he seems at times, over-acting...But as the series goes on it seems that Russel.T.Davies is trying to make the show into something like 'Buffy'; which I happen to be a very big fan of...and Davies fails.And it seems that bits of the show are pieces of Hollywood movies...Overall this is a good show but is let down by some of the plots; and acting."]
