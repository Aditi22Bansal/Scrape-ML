['This crime mini-series is very watchable, but after seeing "Big Little Lies" and "Sharp Objects" recently, the bar has been raised very high lately for this sub-genre, and "The Sinner" is a notch or two below those shows. It has a very intriguing start, but peters out somewhat at the end (the final episode is rather anticlimactic). Also, the direction is not as stylish. But the performances of Jessica Biel, Bill Pullman and Nadia Alexander are amazing; in fact, Biel is the main draw of this series for me, and her absence from the second season is the reason I don\'t think I\'ll be watching it. *** out of 4 for season 1.']
