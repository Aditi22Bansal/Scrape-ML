["Any civilization that can construct such gigantic walls, hundreds of miles long, surely possesses the technology to wipe out the titans; unless I missed it, this is never explained. The graphics are striking, especially the action sequences, and you never quite get used to the titans' facial expressions; they look like bored people waiting for a bus, which is all the more discomforting when they casually pop a human being in their mouth. About that FF button: there are long, long sequences of character development dialogue that could have been shortened considerably in order to tighten the storyline; sometimes this development goes on for several episodes in a row. The classic escalating argument/arrive at a conclusion storytelling armature is rather stretched to its practical limits, and repeats itself many times during the course of the show, long after your patience is exhausted. The entire female titan story arc is rather thrilling and suspenseful, and the payoff is worth the investment of time. Eren can't speak without screaming, so I had to turn my volume way down whenever his face pops up. The whole 3d maneuvering device thing was pretty cool. Overall I loved this series, well what I've seen of it so far, and I'll continue watching."]
