["Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"]
