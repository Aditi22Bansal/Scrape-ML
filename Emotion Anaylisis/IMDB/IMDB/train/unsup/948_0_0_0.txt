["As i went through each episode i couldn't help but start predicting the scenes. The scenes werent only predictable they were illogical. Take for example Three Robots which had three robots on vacation traveling around taking vacations to see post apocalyptic civilizations.Two of the robots had mouths, one digital, one mechanical, both used for talking, but when they looked at human food they... nevermind. It isn't logical and it is a lack of attention to detail.Every episode had these logical errors which dragged down the story. So overall while the idea, the art, the motivation were interesting, the series of short movies failed to keep me entertained."]
