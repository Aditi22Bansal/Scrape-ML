["Avatar: The Last Airbender deserves some serious credit for introducing a new generation to the anime genre. It is extremely hard to not enjoy this series. It has lovable characters, real dangers, plot development, perfectly-timed comedy and a really well thought out storyline.This series is perfectly suited to adults and children alike. Don't kid yourself there are serious issues dealt with but many children will miss those themes and will just appreciate the comedy.If you find yourself enjoying this series then I also recommend you watch The Legend of Korra too. Korra is much darker than Avatar but just as entertaining and intelligent."]
