['During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.This film was released over twenty years ago (I write this in January 2014) and still remains iconic and embedded in the consciousness of the American movie-goer. The attorney on the toilet, the cartoon DNA molecule, and Jeff Goldblum\'s career-defining role (even more so than "The Fly")...I need to see this movie again to really get a handle on it critically, but how do you say anything bad about this picture? Special effects and CGI today cannot compete with what they had then... how have we gone backwards?']
