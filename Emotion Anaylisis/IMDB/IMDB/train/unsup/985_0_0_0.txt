['I grew up watching this cartoon and I have to say I enjoyed it. My favorite episode was Frankendoodle. I thought the first 3 seasons were the best. After Hillenburg left though, like many people I felt that the seasons seemed to lose their charm with each episode. They weren\'t bad but I felt like something in the humor was missing. Instead of clever puns or gags they decided to just use gross-out humor which if done right can be funny but now it\'s just overkill. Most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional now. Also Spongebob\'s more annoying due to his even more high pitched voice and antics. It\'s amazing how oblivious he is to things sometimes like a pet he brought home named "Puffy Fluffy" who turned out to be a monster despite Gary\'s warnings.With that being said it\'s not bad but it almost seems like a shadow of its former self. The animation\'s brighter and better but the stories seem to be hit or miss. It seems like some of them aren\'t really finished or even recycled from previous episodes. If you have little kids they\'ll enjoy it just fine. If you\'re a fan of the show still more power to you. Dive down underwater and see for yourself.']
