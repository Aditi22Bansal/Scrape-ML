['Crime investigation television series do try hard in order to find an interesting theme to accompany the crimes with. Jane\'s story though is quite entertaining, that his case alone would have made a good show. I actually can\'t believe that the Red John case took so long and still had me hooked till the last minute. And even after that, the two seasons after RJ were good as well. Maybe it\'s because Jane has a unique way with dealing with the cases he has to solve. And it is really interesting to watch him "read" his suspects and create his plots. The romantic part though wasn\'t that good; it was more awkward than interesting. So, 6 out of 10.']
