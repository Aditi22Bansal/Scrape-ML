['"Gone Girl" is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband\'s family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple\'s marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in "Gone Girl" to engage our interest except for Fincher\'s jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****']
