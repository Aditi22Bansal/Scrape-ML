['The well-Hyped "prequel", whatever that means, is a pretty good film, I give it "7" of 10, but to me no where near the first three in overall IMPACT. This one came out 22 years after the first "Star Wars" movie. It attempts to show the development of the characters we saw in the others.  AFAIAC, they should have just skipped this one. What we originally knew as the "Star Wars Trilogy" will forever be the real Star Wars movies.Liam Neeson and the others do credible jobs, but they have no where the interest and excitement that Harrison Ford and his cronies had.  I didn\'t fully appreciate back then what a prototypical "action hero" Ford was. Without Darth Vader, without the Wookie, without Han Solo, without Princess Leia, without Chewbacca, without the grown up Luke Skywalker, and without the wise old Ben Kenobi, this is just an ordinary action movie.  Like they say, "you can never go back!"']
