["Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet."]
