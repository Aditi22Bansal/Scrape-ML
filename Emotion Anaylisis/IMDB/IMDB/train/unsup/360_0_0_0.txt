["The old song that every cloud must have a silver lining is so very much appropriate to this 2012 film.Bradley Cooper, as a bipolar man recently discharged from a mental institution, gives a stellar performance in trying to reconnect with his unfaithful wife, the latter driving him to his outrageous behavior and subsequent institutionalization. He meets up with Tiffany, played in a sparkling way by the perky Jennifer Lawrence. They are both tremendous in their emotional outbursts and find through their multitude of problems that they're the perfect couple.Robert De Niro had his best part in years as Cooper's book-making father who wants to use watching television football with his son as a means of therapy. As the mother, Jacki Weaver received a totally undeserved Oscar nomination in the supporting category. Note that the above 3 thespians were all nominated with Lawrence winning and they were all deserved for Oscar consideration.Anyone suggest that Cooper and Miss Lawrence dance in Dancing with the Stars?"]
