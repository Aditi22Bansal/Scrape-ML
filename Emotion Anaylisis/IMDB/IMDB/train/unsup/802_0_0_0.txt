["Showtime, with its addition of Outer Limits and Total Recall - the Series, has done more for original s.f. programming than the Sci Fi Channel. However, Showtime's crowning achievement is Stargate SG-1, a well-developed s.f. series that takes an okay movie and takes it much further.  The characters are well-rounded, various aspects of their galactic travel are explored, there is a wide range of continuing plotlines and costarring characters.  After a somewhat rocky start in the first half of the first season, as they hit all of the standard s.f. cliches (a character ages, they visit a parallel universe, they land on a planet where the female character must combat anti-feminism), they've broadened quite a bit, expanding the backstory of the Stargate itself, the enemy (the Gou'ald), and Earth's role to come.  Highly entertaining, with great performances by Richard Dean Anderson and Christopher Judge in particular.  Catch it now that it's in syndication, if you don't get Showtime."]
