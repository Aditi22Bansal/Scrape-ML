["My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered."]
