["Went to college with rich kids who had nothing to do but use drugs with money their parents gave them. They may think this is some kind of profound story to tell people, but to the rest of us, this isn't.For those of us who were raised well, we were told to stay away from drugs. And I mean, I can see people who were addicted to drugs and know that it's trouble. It's kind of sick that Hollywood glorifies losers like Rue. We were told to stay away from people like this. What happens to them never ends well.I have no idea why Zendaya would take this garbage. She's better than this. Hopefully this show doesn't last long so she can find better gigs to take. This is a show by rich kids who are enamored by the lowlifes they didn't get to spend much time growing up with. I did, and I actually work around them, so have at it! I want no part of this.It's not even a trainwreck you can't stop watching like Fleabag either. Hard pass."]
