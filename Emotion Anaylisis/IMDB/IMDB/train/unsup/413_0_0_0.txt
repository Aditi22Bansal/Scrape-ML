["The story of Amelie will either grab you or it won't. Certainly this is one of the greatest looking films, with a witty frantic style that is a pleasure to look at simply because there is so much to look at. Those wanting to study how to make a film from a visual stand point should put this on the list of films to study.The story is a mixed bag. I know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life. I on the other hand was pained from the get go, finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile. To me it wants to be applauded for being off center instead of being good.Try it, you may like it, or you maybe like me and wonder what all the shouting is about."]
