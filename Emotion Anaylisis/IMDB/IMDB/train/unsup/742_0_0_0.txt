['South Park is HILARIOUS!It is very much a satire, but it being animated gives the creators and writers freedom to do practically whatever they want, and there are NO restrictions in this show. The story lines are constantly funny and amusing, and always entertaining. This is a better show and satire than The Simpsons and Family Guy, and hopefully it continues to bring more episodes for a long time. Also, the way that time never really moves or the boys age is part of what gives it freedom to do whatever it wants. This is a show not afraid to make fun of ANYTHING and not afraid to do whatever it can to make us laugh.']
