["Definitely a show with a few really fun characters.\nWhat's best about the series is precisely its main character, U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens.\nWalton Goggins is great as Boyd Crowder, as is Nick Searcy as Art Mullen.\nEach season is fun and interesting in its own way, and the characters become more fun and layered over time.\nIt's quite a real rarity to see characters like Raylan Givens and Art Mullen on television.\nA fun and interesting series that is definitely worth watching."]
