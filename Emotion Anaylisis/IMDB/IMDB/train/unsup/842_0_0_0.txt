['The production values of Narcos are quite high, and the acting very good. Pablo Escobar was larger than life, and his story is fascinating, so anyone setting out to portray it gets a huge head start. Wild and amazing, yet true! I have watched a couple other Escobar depictions, and this one focuses on the DEA officers involved in his pursuit and take down.My only substantive complaint is that the narration is excessive and unnecessary. It would have been possible to dramatize most of what was said by the narrators, and in some cases the narration was insulting to the viewer as it was evident from the images on the screen what was going on. I am not sure why directors are insisting on using this technique. It works for some films but is sometimes annoying, as in this case.The unwanted overvoice narration notwithstanding, Narcos is overall very good.']
