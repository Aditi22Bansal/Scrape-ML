["I still don't know what the hoopla is all about with this series. It's a costume drama set in 1912 in fictional Downton Abbey where there are plenty of servants and an aristocratic family. The cast is first rate led by Dame Maggie Smith among others. She is a scene stealer. The costumes, art direction, and sets are first rate. I have seen other British dramas with costumes and sets. This drama doesn't seem much different and I'm surprised by its success. I believe class differences between servants and the family to which they serve is considerable. The servants can be cutthroat and vicious. Just look at poor Bates in the first episode. There is plenty of drama going on in the servants quarters while their employers worry about their futures of their three daughters where marriage is the only answer."]
