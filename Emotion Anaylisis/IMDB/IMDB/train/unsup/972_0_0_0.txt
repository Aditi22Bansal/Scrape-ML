['American Dad!: An obvious rip-off of a rip-off!Seth MacFarlane seems to be the most unimaginative guy in the world of the animation. I guess that if I were a Family Guy fan then I would like this too since "American Dad!" have exactly the same kind of jokes and the same stereotypical characters. There is no way than this couldn\'t be more unoriginal: Here we have once again the reactionary father, the liberal daughter with his hippie boy-friend, the stereotypical housewife mother...And like in "Family Guy " the jokes don\'t have any connection with the actual plot from each episode, and there are the same tired cultural references ... But what makes me hate this show more it\'s that instead of improve it,they still recycle the same ideas again and again and try to convince us that they made something completely new. I guess that "American Dad !" won\'t be in my list of favorites.']
