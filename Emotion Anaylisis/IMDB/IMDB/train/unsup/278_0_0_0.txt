["Home Alone is a Christmas family comedy about a young boy named Kevin, who is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season.It stars Macaulay Culkin together with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. It was written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. Kevin McCallister is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. He initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighborhood. Eventually,Kevin tries to contend with the burglars on his own in this slapstick comedy.The film was the highest grossing comedy when it was theatrically released.It definitely provided a lot of joy,humor and entertainment.There was also no dull and boring moment.The cast did a marvelous job in their respective roles.While the movie at present as this review is being written may find this film somewhat overstretched as a comedy by today's standards,it will always be a good family entertainment."]
