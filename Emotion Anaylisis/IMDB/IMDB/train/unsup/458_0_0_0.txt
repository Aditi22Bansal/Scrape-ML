['"Seinfeld" has inserted relevant phrases, words, characters, situations into pop culture and American way of living. No kidding. This sitcom is a highlight in 90\'s culture.I\'m not exaggerating when saying that the situations in "Seinfeld" are seriously taken from real life but only in a funnier way. There\'s humor for all tastes: we get black humor, plenty of sarcasm, laughing at yourself (come on, you can be identified with ANY of the 4 lead characters), double sense, sexual humor, scatological jokes, and more.I enjoyed every single character. The guest appearances added that extra something that sitcoms need. But you never get tired of Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, or George. All of them have elements from any person with a regular life. Heck, when "something" in the likes of "Murphy\'s Law" happens to me in real life, then I immediately think about "Seinfeld".What I\'m trying to say is that this is a very important t.v. show. It set the rules for situation comedies, sarcasm, and more. I have thanked this series for making my life better, happier. I always laugh out loud no matter what episode is. This is definitely the best and funnier sitcom ever. No doubt about it. Forget about the 80\'s corny humor and moral messages; the 90\'s "unique" humor will survive the course of time. If "nothing" means hilarious, then I\'m demented because I laugh everyday with this!']
