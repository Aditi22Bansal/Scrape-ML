['I bailed on this show after watching ep 2 of the second season, as I felt a contempt for every one of the characters.I just watched the latest S3 ep 9 with high hopes there had been a severe culling of the cast or any improvement at all...to my disappointment, it\'s an even more unappealing show now than when I last viewed.This is a lazy, pathetic leeching off the awesome original show, "The Walking Dead", trying to trick viewers into believing the words "the walking dead" equalizes the two. It does not!I am a zombie fan and even enjoy watching old black and white zombie movies, but out of the dozens and dozens of anything zombie I\'ve ever watched, this is by far outstandingly the worst!My advice to the writers and producers, you have the perfect venue to smoothly get rid of the original cast and start with a clean slate. Start over with a new group, and hopefully you can redeem yourselves a little, from this garbage product as it now stands.']
