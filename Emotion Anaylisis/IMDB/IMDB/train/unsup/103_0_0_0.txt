['Having a son who really loves these comic book movies stretches my appreciation for such presentations. We did watch the first one together years ago and it was decent. Since I\'m way past the time when I would have read a comic book featuring most of these characters, I treated it as a movie, only using what happened in the first one as a reference point. I have extensive knowledge of the classics and a long time interest in world mythology. You folks who are all bent out of shape that the mythology got screwed up in this movie need to realize that it is totally screwed up in the comic books. Except for excessive battle scenes which eventually seem to be the same old same old, I rather liked the humor and the plotting. I may even go and see the next one. I\'m hoping I don\'t have to keep saying to my adult son, "Now, who is that guy?" Oh, I did like the guy made out of rocks.']
