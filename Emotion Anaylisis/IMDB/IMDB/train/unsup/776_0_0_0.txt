['I love vampire movies and series, I really liked true blood when it was on, for me season one was fun but not the best season for me, season two was a improvement, season three was great, season four was good but a step down, season five is my favourite season actually, I loved bill turning dark and losing his way, him and Eric working together was great, season six was mainly good, I loved them bringing back human vs vampires, season seven I liked it. It had good moments the only bug problem was honestly there was not credible big bad, true blood is a fun ride with blood gore sex horror campy comedic moments all rolled into one and is a once in a life viewing, one of the best shows HBO ever produced']
