['one of series who are, in profound sense, special. or different. or unexpected. or great. or surprising. because it is not exactly the crime series who could be familiar. it is not the psychological drama who propose mysteries and solutions and brave heroes. it is a gray story about ordinary people, in a Belfast who has the chance to be any town. a precise picture, almost too neutral, about vulnerable people, about a case and about a hunt with double sense. and this small facts transforms it in a admirable work. because it has the chance to be a trip among cold slices of reality.']
