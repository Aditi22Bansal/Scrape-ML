['I finally got to see this as it\'s running on Prime and am surprised at its popularity. The opening scene featuring slashing swords and a body littered battleground which was as devoid of real blood and gore as was the A-Team series . And there isn\'t a lot here with plot either: Ragnar wants to find the fabled "English Coast" so he can kill monks or whoever he finds and add to the Viking hoard of loot whereas the Earl says no. So Ragnar sails off anyway and upsets the status quo. As hokey as it was I found the Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas film The Vikings at least a hoot. Guess if you like your pseudo history easy to follow and accompanied by decent production values then this is your cup of mead.']
