['Except maybe Ari and Lloyd NONE of the boys who make up the little movie star entourage of buddies can act in this show. Vincent\'s actor has struggled after this show to find work in particular because he\'s such a boring actor you can\'t believe any of this good fortune is happening to. However the actor who played Vince\'s older brother Johnny ever found work in Hollywood is beyond me why anyone thought he would be a good idea in it. Except maybe one season everything good happens to them one episode after another like "God" needs Vince\'s permission for it to rain and ooh look another washed up celebrity cameo! Wow. This show has one of the worst opening songs ever and I like a lot of 90s rock. I used to watch this when I had nothing else to watch waiting for a new season of this or that show. At least it wasn\'t as bad as the movie. The movie was not needed at all. The only thing saving this from a 1 star is I did enjoy it somewhat and the series ended really well. However the movie was absolute garbage. Excuse me while I watch Eminem\'s cameo in season 8 on loop.']
