["Keller and Grace Dover's worst fears come true, their six year old daughter Anna and her friend Joy go missing, suspicions point to Alex Jones, the driver of an RV which was parked near by. Detective Loki is in charge of the case, he has no choice but to release Alex, having only circumstantial evidence to hold him on. Desperate father Keller decides to take matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex, hiding him behind a false wall and battering him regularly into a confession.This is one of the darkest, most bleak films I can remember, almost slightly too bleak in terms of tone, a wee bit too harrowing in parts, that said it was exceptionally well acted, well directed, and definitely one of those films that stirs the emotions. I wish it wasn't so long, it seemed to go on forever.Far from being a feel good film, it's violence with linger with you long after the credits have rolled.Paul Dano was brilliant in his part, such a good actor, possibly the best element of the film, although Jackman puts in a stellar performance too. Gritty, heavy and full of suspense, definitely worth a watch. 8/10"]
