['Sigh. Having read through some of the IMDb user comments, it\'s clear that the new Battlestar Galactica is another one of those cases where the audience is split down the middle, one side loving it to high heaven and the other hating it with a vengeance.I am one of the ones who love it, and I just can\'t understand the incredible bashing that the haters are giving the show. It\'s probably the best SF TV-show there ever was. Filled with strong characters, strong actors, strong writing and brilliant storytelling structure.Gaius Baltar is the greatest "crazy scientist" this side of Dr. Frankenstein; his increasingly schizoid personality is superbly rendered.There are only two things wrong with this show: One, we don\'t see nearly enough of Starbuck. Two, there is apparently no budget for the astronomical side of things - when they get water from an ice moon, we see nothing of it. We\'re just told that it happened. I wanna see some planets and alien environments! Come on, it can\'t be that expensive!But overall, an unspeakably great show with lots of story of a quality that doesn\'t insult your intelligence. This is fantastic space opera! History will be the judge, and this show will be utterly classic.My rating: 8 out of 10 - it was 9 in the first season, but I think the quality has trailed off.']
