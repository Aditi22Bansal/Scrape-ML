["I watched all of season 1, but season 2 was not so interesting and I failed to watch all episodes. But now, 2019 in season 3, I am hooked again. It is 1960 and Midge is branching out to do shows outside of Manhattan, and even goes to Vegas to work with a more well-known entertainer, a fictional singer, Shy Baldwin.I watch the show because Rachel Brosnahan is so good as Mrs. Maisel, 'Midge'. She is far from perfect, she gets divorced and doesn't seem to care much what happens to her two kids, often being cared for by the grandparents who have their own issues. I really like Tony Shalhoub as her dad, Professor Abe Weissman.Also really good is Alex Borstein as short, spineless Susie Myerson, a friend who serves as her manager, rarely taking a strong stand on anything but needs the 10% she gets from her clients. She has a very funny style about her, her character is a goofball in a very nice way. But I also must say her overly dirty mouth gets tiresome quickly.The late-1950s, early 1960s is done very well, that was the period when I was a teenager so it brings back good memories of a simpler time."]
