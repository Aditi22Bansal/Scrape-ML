["The show starts with a crashed jet on a deserted island. The survivors find the island is not so deserted and one of many mystery. On its surface, it is simply a scripted version of Survivor, the popular TV reality show. But as it develops, it shows itself to be much much more. The vast and varied cast is led by TV veteran Matthew Fox. They form a great family group of many individual skills. Their chemistry is truly compelling.This is J.J. Abrams' best creation of all of his many projects. The pilot is terrific and I love the first season as we follow the various characters. I don't want to give any spoilers. This is must-see TV."]
