["The 1990's was a mediocre time for sci-fi series in my opinion. Stargate SG-1 was one of the few good series.Like so many good shows what helped Stargate SG-1 was it's awesome cast; Richard Dean Anderson as Col. O' Neill, Amanda Tapping as Captain/Major Carter, Michael Shanks as Dr. Jackson, Don S. Davis as Major General Hammond and Christopher Judge as Teal'c.All the characters are brilliant. The chemistry between them is great. Some of the Stargate SG-1 plots have been a little bit weak but you wouldn't notice because of the brilliant cast. The SG-1 team kind of remind me of The A-Team from the 80's because they stick together, they're good friends outside work and they always do the right things.The villains in this series could rival many of the villains from Star Trek. We have had the SG-1 team fighting the likes of the G'ouald and the replicators. The storylines have been consistently good throughout.All in all, this is a good series. My only criticism is the fact that the talented Teryl Rothery who plays Dr. Frasier hasn't had any good storylines of her own."]
