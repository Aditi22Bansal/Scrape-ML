['I see it as one of most inspired films about faith. The faith to an ideal. The faith as expression of love. And duty. that does it special. And defines Mel Gibson as a great director. The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene. Impecable made. Great using each detail. A film about the essence of freedom. And about the price for give to it sense and form and blood.']
