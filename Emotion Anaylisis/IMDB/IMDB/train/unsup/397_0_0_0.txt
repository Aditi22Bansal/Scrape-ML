["Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old Korean War hero who recently lost his loving wife. He's a hard cold man of a different generation. He's angry at young grandkids, his new Mon neighbors, and nosy Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). The next door neighbor boy is shy Thao who gets wrangled into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his older gangster cousin.There are lots of easy stereotypes. Clint is playing the hard man. It might as well be the man with no name in the hood. Clint is acting with a bunch of nobodies. That's the biggest problem in this movie. The other actors are not up to snuff. The only one capable is the girl Ahney Her who can only really hold her own.In the end, we love this Clint character. That's all that matters. He is compelling, and we have all grown up with this character. We know him. The movie is the better for it."]
