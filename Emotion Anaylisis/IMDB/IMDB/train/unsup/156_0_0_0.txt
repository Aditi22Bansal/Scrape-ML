["YES! A sequel that was actually better than the first installment. Now that's how you follow up a movie.Now, to be perfectly honest, I actually didn't even like the first Deadpool. I think I just wasn't prepared for how raunchy it was... well that and it wasn't all that funny. Part two is definitely as raunchy, but 1.) It isn't as sex heavy. I didn't watch Deadpool for frequent sex scenes or sex references.\n2.) It is funnier. They added some more visual humor which had me laughing-out-loud a lot more than the Ryan Reynolds' quips. \n3.) It has better action. By adding some other super powered characters we go to see some better action. \n4.) The story is so much better. Deadpool finds himself having to be selfless to save someone and it's not the bland save-the-girlfriend bit.I truly enjoyed this movie and I like the direction Deadpool is moving. It is trending upward."]
