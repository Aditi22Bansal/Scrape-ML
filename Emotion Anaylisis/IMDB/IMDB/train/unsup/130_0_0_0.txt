['John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis\' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new "Red Dawn" where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans. The original is now a time capsule. "Die Hard" remains timeless because the terrorists were "European" and not tied to any particular ideology or movement. This was a wise decision.']
