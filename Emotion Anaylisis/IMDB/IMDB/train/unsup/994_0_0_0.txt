['I\'m sorry but I couldnt even make it through the first episode with "everybody humpin around!" I\'ve never SEEN a show with SO MUCH sex! And you think they\'d be trying to draw in viewership in the first episode!!! But by the time I cut it off, I\'d already seen 3 instances of sex, a guy humping a wall, a couple having sex, and 2 women having EXTREMELY EXPLICIT sex!!! I thought I\'d rented this from the back room of the video store!!! Needless to say, I was HIGHLY offended by the amount of sex, if a writer has to pad their script with THAT MUCH sex, then they have NO confidence in their writing skills/ storyline. I thought this was supposed to be some big, innovative series, but I can see now why it got cancelled so quickly! I would have cancelled it after the first episode! The storyline is just WEAK, the acting SUCKS, the locations are great, but that won\'t save them from the sinking ship. This is the S.S Sens 8 Titanic!!']
