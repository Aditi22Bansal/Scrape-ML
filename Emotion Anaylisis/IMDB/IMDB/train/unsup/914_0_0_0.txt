["That's probably not my last comment about this tremendous TV show which reminds me ROAD HOUSE, WALKING TALL and some other stuff on this basic scheme: country side action and crime story. But that's all. For the rest, that's a typical new series where you will find nothing you may purchase in big screen pictures, about characters development - of course, you have more space and time to do it - and daring screenplay schemes, violence at a rate that, in for most cinema made films, it would be Parents Guidance rated. And that would not enhance the box office performance. But for home audiences, who cares if you have tons of brutality, that, on the contrary, enlarge, increase, the audiences and assure the show to continue beyond the first season? Take for instance a family father who wants to go and wee a brutal film in a theatre with his children; he can't, because the PG rating. But if he is at home, he puts the kids in the bedroom with a computer and he is quiet and comfortable to watch the film in the living room....It is important to understand the differences between big screen movies and TV series."]
