['Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas "Neo" Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, "You\'ve been living two lives. In one life, you\'re Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias \'Neo\' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not." That\'s a good description. Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be "The One". Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss\' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers."Unfortunately, nobody can be told what \'The Matrix\' is. You have to see it for yourself." I watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next...A stunning audio-visual achievement.********* The Matrix (1999) Larry & Andy Wachowski ~ Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving']
