['Opening plot spoiler is they kill off Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) before the credits so we lose the banter that worked so well in the first film. Her death weighed heavy into the plot themes as the plot lacked. Don\'t feel too bad, because in X-Men, time travel is possible and they can bring her back in any episode. The film includes numerous pop culture references and asides as if to critique itself. In one scene Deadpool signs an autograph as "Ryan Reynolds" and if anything they may have used this type of humor too often. Julian Dennison, who we loved as the orphan in "Hunt for the Wilderpeople" continues as the disagreeable orphan. Zazie Beetz takes over for Morena Baccarin in the off beat comedy role. Her super power is "luck." Brad Pitt is listed as "The Vanisher" in the credits, but was never seen and I don\'t recall any lines. Matt Damon also in a cameo. Guide: Heavy swearing. Butt nudity.']
