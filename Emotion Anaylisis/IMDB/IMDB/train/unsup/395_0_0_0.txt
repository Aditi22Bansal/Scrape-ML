['"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" was made in 1989 and bristles with excitement, humor, suspense, special effects and, as a real plus, character development. In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy\'s father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ\'s blood while interring him. It\'s up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there\'s a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.']
