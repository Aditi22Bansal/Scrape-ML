["Not for the hopeless romantic; but the helpless romantic. This is a touching love story based on a Nicholas Sparks novel and exceptionally directed by Nick Cassavetes. THE NOTEBOOK is about an older gentleman(James Garner), who reads from an old notebook retelling a timeless love story to his aging companion(Gena Rowlands)in a nursing home. The tale brings back the love story of a young couple(Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams)who are separated by social class, a World War and a planned wedding. The young couple is passionately reunited seven years after they took different paths. The elder woman's memory fades in and out, but hearing the notebook read in episodes helps her relive the turbulent and timeless romance. A beautiful ending leads you to where you thought the story would go. One box of tissues may not be enough. Other cast members of note: Joan Allen, Sam Shepard, Kevin Connolly and Starletta DuPois."]
