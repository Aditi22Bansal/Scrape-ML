['"THAT \'70S SHOW," in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven\'t seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. I liked it when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run, especially Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He was my favorite character. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on FX for fans of the show to see for a long time.']
