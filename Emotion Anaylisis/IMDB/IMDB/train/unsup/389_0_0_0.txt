["Guy Ritchie transforms Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stoic and methodical super sleuth into a scruffy, rough and tough detective; not exactly the great Basil Rathbone. Robert Downey Jr. earns his Golden Globe starring as London's legendary Sherlock Holmes. His trusted side-kick Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law. Rachel McAdams stars as the only woman to best Holmes and continues a very testy relationship with the detective. Holmes and Watson will face off against a mysterious villain named Blackstone(Mark Strong). Plenty of thrills mixed with violence and action comedy. Very interesting chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. Well photographed. Apt supporting cast featuring: Eddie Marsan, William Houston, Kelly Reilly, Hans Matheson and Robert Maillet."]
