["Lacked subtitles for the elderly, disabled, hearing impaired, and ESL viewers. Disrespectful & cheap on the part of the producers especially when audio & enunciation is poor, and the varying British dialects. Dialogue is important!Main weaknesses: Trying to be cutesy clever by having actors talk directly to the camera. Second, usual hooks of alcohol & smoking to seem like just regular folk. Very pretentious dialogue. First episode was completely people just sitting around a table drinking & arguing. Usual social corporate gathering party including garden party scenes (both with food & drinks as the main props, of course). Usual search for romance. That's it."]
