['The first time I saw the promos for this show, I thought that it was going to be pretty bad, like those awful "High School Musical" films. However, when I watched it, I was surprised of how good it was: The plot and the characters were pretty interesting, the songs were incredibly good, and the performances were more than decent. I like this show very much. It is one of the best shows to be still on air.This show was made by the creator of Nip Tuck, but this show is way more light-hearted and optimistic. And more enjoyable too.No wonder why this show is so successful, it is one of the best shows of the recent years. "Glee" deserves all the hype it receives.']
