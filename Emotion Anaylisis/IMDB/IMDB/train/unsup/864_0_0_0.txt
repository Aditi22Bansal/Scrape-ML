['This was just wonderful! Only complaints are the way they got rid of Madara , the inclusion of the Otsutsuki rabbit woman and that Sasuke and Naruto were reincarnations of those 2 guys i forgot their names. They fell completely out of place from the rest of the series. Other than that it was a magnificent journey.']
