["I've been working my way through the Marvel Cinematic Universe films lately and THOR: RAGNAROK marks a pleasing change from the norm (the last two I saw, BLACK PANTHER and SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, were both average and I'd hoped for more). This is more like the tone of the original GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (and much better than the disappointing sequel), i.e. it manages to tell a good adventure story while being very funny and quirky at the same time.The expansive Thor mythology and backdrop has kicked up a gear, so that all of the characters return for a faster and funnier tale. I liked the idea of the prison planet ruled by a perfect Jeff Goldblum, and of course there's all the action you can hope for. However, the character beats are where this film really works: Chris Hemsworth has never been warmer, more human, or funnier, and Mark Ruffalo shines in a smaller role. Things build to the typical OTT climax which manages to work this time around by focusing on the individuals throughout, and the end result is one of the most likeable Marvel pictures yet. Bring on the next!"]
