['First, I should admit that I can\'t verify the accuracy of "The Social Network". Nonetheless, David Fincher\'s look at Facebook\'s origins is a very engrossing movie. Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically? Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie."The Social Network" does come out really good. The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about. Of course, people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook.Definitely worth seeing.']
