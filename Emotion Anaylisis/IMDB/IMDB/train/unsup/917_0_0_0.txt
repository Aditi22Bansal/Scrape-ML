["Firstly, Thank you BBC for putting a drama on for a Saturday Night, how many years has it been? Secondly thanks for making it something as special as Taboo. A few episodes in and I am utterly hooked, it is gripping, beautifully made, somehow cinematic, boasting wonderful music, glorious settings, and acting that is beyond impressive. Tom Hardy will always attract fans in their millions, his looks and talent make him a massive hit, I have a feeling we'll be seeing James Delaney for many years to come. David Hayman and Jonathan Pryce are both superb in their own rights. The trailers made this show look good, but in reality it is quite special, a period drama that is dark, gritty and wonderfully Gothic. I like that there is an air of mystery surrounding it too, can't wait to see how this unfolds. Do not miss this, you'll love it."]
