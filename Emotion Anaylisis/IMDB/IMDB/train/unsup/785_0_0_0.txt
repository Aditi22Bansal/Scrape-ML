['Sometimes you watch a show, just to check it out and see what it\'s about and discover all these great things about it. I came across Mindhunter, a friend recommended it to me, he suggested I gave it a try and so I did, and I have to say this is some of the most amazing things I\'ve seen. It\'s not just a show it\'s an episodic movie, placed in many chapters and sequences with very intricate character development and incredibly well acted, well produced and well written. The biographical elements are woven into it\'s rich fictional plot and made to seem as accurate as possible. The way the serial killers\' minds work, the whole show is about that basically, it\'s a personification of these "sequence killers" as it was known back then, it\'s brilliant, kitschy and very very intense. David Fincher really created a masterpiece here and this is practically an addition to the plethora of reasons why 21st century Fincher is a tier ahead of the 20th century Fincher, he\'s exploring different mediums and that is a really good way to tell more stories in different ways with very well developed cores and characters with as much experimentation that he can do with his limited script.']
