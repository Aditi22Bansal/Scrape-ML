['Amy Pohler\'s character, a 34 year old city hall "up and comer" has just been appointed to the assignment of her career: Head of a committee to turn a hazardous abandoned construction site into a beautiful recreational park. Public support appears to be minimal, yet our heroine presses on.A side plot reveals the star\'s unrealistic ambitions to take public service all the way to the Oval Office, as well as an inferiority complex toward her mother, who (in contrast to young Amy) is a high ranking city official.I\'m a big fan of the star, and I\'m glad she didn\'t retire after having her baby and leaving SNL. The new show "Parks and Recreation", styled after the extremely popular "Office", offers a few laughs here and there, but leaves very little for anyone to anticipate and look forward to subsequent episodes.This is a spotlight for a very talented comedienne, but I see no chance for anything remotely comparable to "30 Rock" coming from this humble sit-com. Unless someone knows something I don\'t know, the buzz should fizzle long before a full season goes on the air.']
