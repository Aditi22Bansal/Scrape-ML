['OK, I admit. I am not particularly open to shows or movies, which have a major loser as the lead role. William H. Macy, as good as he is, is difficult to watch, in this train wreck of a character. I gave up after only two episodes.The rest of the cast is very good. The closest Shameless comes to nobility is oldest daughter Fiona, beautifully played by Emmy Rossum, who single-handedly gives the show a reason for being and viewers a possible reason for returning. Fiona is afraid to hope for more than she has, yet may have found it in a nice man who comes to her rescue at a bar. He is well played too.The family dysfunction is entertaining. And so is Emmy Rossum, in addition to being very easy to look at and watch! But, the lead character was so lacking in redeeming characteristics, and such a boring schmo, I just could not take it anymore.']
