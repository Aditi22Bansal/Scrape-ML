['An investigative team within NCIS solve US Navy based crime. Like procedurals such as CSI there\'s lab work, morgue pathology scenes and field work with gun-wielding ex-marines and agents. There\'s humour, heart, good plots and silly one-liners. Often the cases can be dangerous with suspense, gory bits and emotional scenes where their private life issues impact on work. There are great, varied characters from the goth vampy science lab-rat Abby (Pauley Perrette), British Pathologist "Ducky" (David McCullum), wise-cracker playboy DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) lead by their commander Gibbs (Mark Harmon) to, in some of the series, the fabulous tough-gal ex-Mossad agent Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) who all bring various aspects to the stories.Like all procedurals, there are some jumps of supposition, and like all similar American programs it\'s a bit formulaic, and can be silly and predictable, with some cheese, but it\'s great television, very watchable and the cases - being military - are slightly different from the normal city-cop version of this sort of program you usually get. It\'s an enjoyable watch with something for everyone. Easily the best US murder/investigative procedural on TV at present.']
