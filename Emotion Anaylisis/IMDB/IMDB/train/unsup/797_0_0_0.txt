['Some of the best TV I\'ve seen in quite a while. I may like this even better than Monk, and I like Monk quite a bit.Shawn constantly flips out pop cultural references from well before his time. He must have spent a good portion of his youth watching every possible rerun. LOL Catching and figuring them all out can be a pretty good game for the viewer all by itself.I truly think that the USA Network is consistently putting out the best new programming around. This is a pleasant contrast to the Sci-Fi Network, which is doing its best to buy up and budget kill anything that threatens to be good sci-fi.The three series from USA that we watch religiously (Psych, Monk, and Burn Notice) is a larger count than the combined shows we watch from the original "big 3" .... combined.Keep up the good work, USA, and we\'ll keep watching!']
