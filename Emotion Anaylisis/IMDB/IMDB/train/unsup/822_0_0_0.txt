["The Punisher is a fresh and entertaining show. For those who love violence, hand to hand combat and realism this show is for you. The Punisher has a somewhat slow start in that it gives you a loose picture of what the story is driven by and what Frank Castle is driven by. In the first few minutes you see him take revenge on those people who killed his family. The show looks at the wider conspiracy as to why they were murdered. The conspiracy is pulled off well and the cast deliver some solid performances. Jon Bernthal was born for this role and pulls it off with ease. The only criticism is the one dimensional nature of the show with Frank and the rest of the cast. There is no irony, poetic justice and depth beyond the 'eye for an eye' story which could have taken it to new heights but this is that bit extra that I personally might have liked. But nevertheless it doesn't reduce the quality or intensity of the show and it still makes for excellent viewing. Highly recommended, I can't wait for season 2. \n8/10"]
