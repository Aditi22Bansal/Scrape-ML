['Over the last couple of years I watch "Gilmore Girls" on my NBC affiliate out of Richmond, VA every week late nights on Mondays the previous episode of it is shown, and I\'ve been hooked to it because I don\'t get the WB. The writing and scripts of this show are so interesting and lovable you have Lorelai Gilmore as a thirty year old single mother, which is played wonderfully by Lauren Graham. Lorelai tries to raise her college-aged daughter Rory Gilmore, while at the same time deal with love and relationships in her small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai is witty, and a feisty coffee addict while working at the local hotel inn, yet she shows a toughness in dealing with her daughter Rory who could quote an oxford dictionary, plus dealing with the Grandparents isn\'t easy when they try to side with Rory, Lorelai always holds her head high and love conquers all. While this season the show seems to be losing some luster and good stories, it\'s still interesting with the love triangle that Lorelai has with Luke. To sum it up this is still in my opinion one of the better and most underrated shows around why Lauren Graham doesn\'t receive more credit and awards is beyond me, she is sexy and has a sharp witty intellect.']
