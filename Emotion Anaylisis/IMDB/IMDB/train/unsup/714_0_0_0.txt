["A pirate named Luffy wants to become the pirate king, but besides that, he is on a quest to go to the Grand Line and organise his own pirate to search for the treasure that that has sent people sailing to the seas, called 'One Piece'.ONE PIECE is an absolutely fantastic and fun anime. Also every episode in the series cannot be missed, since each episode has something to do with the storyline which make the show more and more addictive, unlike some other TV shows. There are even times where it can actually even make you care for the characters, which also make the show surprisingly moving.IMPORTANT: Beware of the English dub because it's been Americanised and politically-corrected to make it a kids show. It's been distributed by 4Kids. So in other words, ONLY watch the Japanese version otherwise the American version will turn you off."]
