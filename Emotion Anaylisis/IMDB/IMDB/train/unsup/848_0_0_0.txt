["As great as Timothy Olyphant is as playing the Raylan Givens character he's made better by having a good character like Walton Goggins' character Boyd Crowder to play off of.In season one Boyd was in the pilot which was a great pilot but then because of other obligations Goggins didn't return until later that season. And while the non Boyd episodes of Justified were still decent TV they weren't as great as when Boyd returned to the show. The show without Boyd was just a villain of the week type of show. But with Boyd back on the show was much more of a serial show were the story lines carrier over from week-to-week instead of being selt contained episodes."]
