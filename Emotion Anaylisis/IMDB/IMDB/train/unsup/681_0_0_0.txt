["New girl had a nice, solid first season. It was funny, it was witty, it was interesting, it had the friendship, woman-man dynamics and americans in their late twenties living together theme. Second season was just mediocrity. Third season tried to hard. For the fourth season, I've decided to get advise from the fellow viewers and their reviews about it and I came to a conclusion that it is just a waste of time. So, maybe watch the two first season and leave it there, if you want to try this one, something that the producers of this show should have done as well. Or at least, they should have provided fresh material and entertaining jokes. The characters change in the blink of an eye and not in a good way. The romance is just boring, the jokes old and tiring after being repeated for some seasons now, the actors look like they themselves got tired of this show and overall, the plot drags. So 3 out of 10."]
