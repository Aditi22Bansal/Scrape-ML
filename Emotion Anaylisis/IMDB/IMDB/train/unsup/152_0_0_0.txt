['high technology. imaginative director. tasteful cocktail of myths, ecology and defense of basic values of human kind. against every critic, it is an amazing show. seductive, touching, maybe not profound but convincing. it is easy to blame it and it is easy to proclaim it as masterpiece. if you ignore its purpose. because the film has the admirable virtue to propose new measure unit in cinematography. than - to give the best image to a lot of problems of every day news. not the least, to give a challenge. to public, critics and cultural media . and that fact is the only important. because, fan or enemy of Cameron vision, it remains not easy to ignore. because it represents a new mythology, inspired mixture of elements from Sci Fi and old fairy tales.the only problem - maybe Sam Wortihington. but, in few decades, each error becomes a virtue.']
