["if there's one scene indicative of this film it's the opening scene where two armies face one another . They decided to settle their differences by having a fight between their greatest warrior . Call for Achilles who has to battle a man mountain . Some time is taken by introducing this character who we are told is unlikable but a superlative warrior . He comes to the battlefield , all eyes are upon and if you blink you'll miss him killing his opponent . Anti-climatic isn't a strong enough description The rest of the film progresses in the same way . You constantly notice that this might be a good film but there's several factors stopping this from happening that you can't put your finger on . One fault that is painfully noticeable is that the two leads are played by Pitt and Bana neither of who are suited to the material . Brad Pitt might provide box office and eye candy but he's an absolutely hopeless actor . Bana is a good actor but this type of historical adventure is beyond him and he gives a stilted unconvincing performance made worse by the British cast in general and Brian Cox in particular who have spent many years treading the boards doing Shakespeare . In summary Troy is watchable but never more than that"]
