['CSI was suppose to be the "backup" with a remake of the Fugitive originally. But now, thirteen years later, guess which show made it? As the show shows what it is like to see the overlooked forensics and crime experts that work in the background while the police are at the front.The original show set in Las Vegas proves what happens in Vegas does not always stay that way. Like Law & Order, the show has seen it\'s fair of cast changes.But still the show does it\'s best to not run out of story lines. And to see where the evidence is. And who really is the culprit. As the evidence lies with them.An original show that has now NY and the now canceled Miami!']
