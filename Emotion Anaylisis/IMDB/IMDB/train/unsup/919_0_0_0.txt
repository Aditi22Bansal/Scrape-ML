["This is one of the best series i have ever seen. 13 reasons why is so heart touching and makes us thrilled in every single episode. Katherine as Hannah and Dylan as Clay had a very good chemistry and both of them did a decent job. Another best part of the series is the soundtrack. The background musics and the songs were just perfect for the mood of the series. All the leading cast did great with their roles. The cinematography is so good as every frame feel like we are in it. All 13 episodes are thrilling and at at the same entertaining. 13 Reasons Why is a must watch. Don't miss this series."]
