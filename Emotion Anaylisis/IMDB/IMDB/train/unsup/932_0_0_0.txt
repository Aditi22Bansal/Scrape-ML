["The mystery behind this show was very well thought out. During the entire series your trying to figure out who A is. That might sound like a boring concept, but as you follow the lives of the main cast; its extremely interesting. Unlike a normal high school drama, I find the series has more of an adult feel to it. The smaller stories within the big are extremely interesting that it keeps you wanting to watch more. The cast chosen for the show are very talented actresses/actors; they all play extremely well off of each other and do such an amazing job with their parts. The only reason I don't give this one a 10, is that the last season doesn't do the show justice."]
