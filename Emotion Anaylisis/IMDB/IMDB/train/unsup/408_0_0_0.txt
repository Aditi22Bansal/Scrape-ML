["This animated fantasy is far and beyond others in the genre. This is the standard others will be judged by for a long time to come. A peace loving ogre called Shrek(Mike Myers) is upset when his swamp is invaded with fairy tale characters. A lonely, hysterically funny donkey(Eddie Murphy)forces his way into becoming Shrek's running buddy. An egomaniacal lord(John Lithgow)has the chance to become king, if he marries. Shrek is offered his swamp vacated if he retrieves the pretty princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and brings her to the midget ruler for marriage.The crude 'potty' humor is mild and does not distract from the clever written story line; and this comedy can't help but amuse viewers of all ages. Myers of course has the top billing, but I think Murphy steals the whole show. I think the witty donkey could carry his own movie someday. SHREK lives up to and deserves all of its accolades. Take the time to experience a superb story of love and companionship."]
