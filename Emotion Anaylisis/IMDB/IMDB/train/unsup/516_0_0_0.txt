["And had me hooked on James Spader's performance. The only performance worth noting as the rest, including co-star Megan Boone, are wooden. Granted, the quality of the script leaves a huge amount to be desired. A lot of gunfight at the OK corral shoot-em-ups, and plot holes to sink a battleship.You know it's awful when you realize that the main characters dodging all the bullets episode after episode leaves you pleading for them, once, to die already.And the FBI director? He gives wooden an entirely new definition. He seems to report to the newbie, Elizabeth Keen, who keeps the name of the man who tried to kill her. And she's a profiler always out of the office without a bullet proof vest in the middle of blow 'em to kingdom come battle scenes. Because sexy.I hate to see James wasted in such drivel. His performance is riveting. It would be downright amazing with a good script and less the endless shooting everywhere, all the time, forever and ever."]
