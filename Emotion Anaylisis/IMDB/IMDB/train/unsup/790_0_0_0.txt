['It is a serie about yourself. Episode by episode. The animation, the dialogues, the characters are far be sugar drops. But this is the basic virtue of a serie defining, in profound-precise manner, the traits of contemporary world. It is a film about Hollywoo but, in the same measure, it is a good serie about the deep loneliness of us, far by excuses or surrogates. The result is not comfortable but it is so easy to understand than BJack is just yourself.']
