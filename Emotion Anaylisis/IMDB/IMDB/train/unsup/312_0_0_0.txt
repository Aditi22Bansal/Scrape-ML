["After an unfortunate incident in Africa, the UN decides that the Avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a UN entity control the Avengers. Tony Stark is for this, Captain America against it. When the UN meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked, and several UN representatives killed, it appears to be the work of Winter Soldier. Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can. One such character is Spider Man, who is incredibly irritating. Certainly a reason to skip the Spider Man movie. One for fans of comic book movies only."]
