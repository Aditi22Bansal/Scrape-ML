['A modern day \'Flintstones\'.  This show is already a classic, and it is still running.  The writers are having a hard time finding new material, but keeps fresh with modern day social humor.  Homer can be a little too much at times.  The show pushes against Political correctness to the limit.  The only weak character is the Doctor, I know it is a poke at "the cosby show" but hey that show has been off the air for over 11 year and a lot of viewers miss that punch line.  It\'s getting too old.  My favorite episode is the time travel one with Homer.  Only problem, with the show\'s popularity, is the over play of reruns.  I am starting to become sick of the over played episodes, and it will become another MASH.  MASH used to be shown 7 days a week like the the Simpsons.  It is too bad, we had to wait for 4 years for it to come to Canada. You see a lot of Conan O\'Brien humor in both shows.']
