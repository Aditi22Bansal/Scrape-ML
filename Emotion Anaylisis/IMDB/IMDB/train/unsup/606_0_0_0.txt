['Season 1: 3/10 (2 viewings, 2/15/2021)\nI watched this when it first came out but didn\'t like it enough to keep going past season 1. All my friends keep talking about how awesome it is, so i decided to watch it all. Going thru season 1 again was basically unbearable and very difficult to get thru. It is jam-packed with the worst part about all anime. The long extensive scenes of talking to yourself and questioning things. "why am i doing this? They\'re all counting on me and i am just going to let them down? What kind of a person would just watch when they could do something about it? Why would they give us these orders? Should i just follow them blindly? Should i stop asking questions and do something?????" i wanted to yell "SHUT UP ALREADY" numerous times. As many as 5 episodes pass with 1 or 2 plot points combined. UnacceptableSeason 2: 4 stars (1 viewing, 2/19/2021)\nSeason 3: 3 stars (1 viewing, 3/9/2021)']
