['The Galaxy Defenders in their very first mission (or is it? With prequels and such you never know really). The movie on hand though does work very well (even the little CGI that was used held up quite good I\'d say), which is the achievement (especially) by the actors! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work perfectly together. The stern almost emotionless Tommy (aka K) and the energetic J, who\'s all over the place. That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the "aliens" that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them. Some are in the background some are shown very openly. A good mix of Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy.']
