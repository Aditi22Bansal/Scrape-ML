["I could barely watch this. i only kept going cause i wanted to see my boy tommyseries 1: 3\nsuper duper boring. crappier version of boardwalk empire. seemed to be generally well made until some ridiculously stupid stuff started happening... (1 viewing)\nSPOILERS\n...like when the gangs are about to shoot each other, the sister comes in between with her baby and tells them they shouldn't kill each other. doesn't work but still so stupid, and when the shooting starts it's ridiculous and absurd. how are a group of 30 men going to allow an opponent to walk out in front and shoot their boss in the head smh. dumbest thing ever. also some super basic subplots like the estranged father who shows up out of nowhere wanting something and convincing a son to trust him before inevitably betraying him. i feel like some of the subplots could have been from old sitcoms like boy meets world or fresh prince.\n*********************************************************************Series 2: 4\neh. too boring. i quit (1 viewing)"]
