['"Grimm" is one of the coolest representations of Portland. Like "Portlandia", it shows the City of Roses at its quirkiest. The focus is a police detective who is a descendant of beings who kept a balance between humans and mythological beings, and so he can see monsters who appear as humans to everyone else. So whenever there\'s a string of bizarre murders or kidnappings, he knows what\'s up. With the help of his lupine friend, the detective keeps Portland safe (and weird). Meanwhile, there are secondary story lines that reach all the way to Austria.It\'s just a really good show. It demonstrates that when Hollywood puts its mind to it, it creates shows that are worth watching. I think that you\'ll like the show.PS: Another "Grimm" is a Dutch movie about a pair of siblings who escape a dangerous situation a la Hansel and Gretel...only then it turns out that the main part of the movie hasn\'t even started.']
