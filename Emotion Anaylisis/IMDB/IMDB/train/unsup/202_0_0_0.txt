['At this point, "The Avengers" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it\'s obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn\'t take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn\'t quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn\'t quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it\'s just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in "The Avengers". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren\'t fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...']
