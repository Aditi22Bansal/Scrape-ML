['The original "Terminator" movie had a low-budget look about it, but money was obviously not an issue with this blockbuster Hollywood sequel.This time around, Ahhnold is the good guy, sent back in time to protect the son of Linda Hamilton from another and more advanced terminator, ALSO sent back in time to kill him. This new model looks like liquid mercury and can take on the appearance of anyone and anything he happens to be around. This gives the visual effects artists all kinds of opportunities to show off, which they do. These effects were a big deal at the time, and even with all of the more sophisticated computer effects of today, they still hold up well.The film looks dazzling, and it benefits from a sense of humor that the first one didn\'t have.Grade: A']
