["I watched about 2 or 3 shows and a few bits and pieces of other shows. As the rappers say don't believe the hype. Funny in spots, and the acting is OK. The show loses my attention span very quickly. I find the show a little too close for real life. Sex in the city make this viewer happy he is married. The moral or thesis of the show is the female characters are too self-absorbed with their own feeling, jobs etc they leave no room for a real relationship. Throwing oneself sexually is never going create a healthy longterm relationship. I believe the show either displays the selfish silliness or that the characters really do not want a man. Either way I find the characters too hollow to watch for a long time. They do not even treat each other too well with some of the games they play on each other. 5 out of 10. Some buddy please help these people."]
