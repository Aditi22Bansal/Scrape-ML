['In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 "WarGames" voice and proclaims, "Shall we play a game?" Of course Captain America can\'t catch the humor.Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.']
