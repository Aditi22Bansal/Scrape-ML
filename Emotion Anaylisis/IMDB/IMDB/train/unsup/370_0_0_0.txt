['(Spoilers Ahead)Though Schindler\'s List is the best film on the horror that was the holocaust, Life Is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella in Italian) is way up there. And I enjoyed it.  Especially because the film doesn\'t completely circle around the concentration camp, just half of it.  Half of the film surrounds Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni won a well deserved best actor Oscar as Guido, along with a second Oscar for best Foreign film as director and writer) as a Italian-Jewish waiter who is in love with a "princess".  This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp.  But so to shield his son from the horrors, he makes a game the two can play as their ordeal unfolds.  Very original, and very well done, with Benigni acting now aa a Italian version of Charlie Chaplin. Excellent all around.  A+']
