['"Brooklyn Nine-Nine" tells the story of a very special police department, in which a set of widely different characters fights crime and personal struggels in New York City.When I saw the first episodes, I wasn\'t fully convinced yet. In my opinion you take a moment to get to know all of the characters better and understand the special dynamic within the cast. But once you\'ve grown attached to them, you will soon notice how brilliantly producers managed to create a balance between episodal plots, steady characters and more serious moments, thus enabling a scenerie that never gets boring and gives you both surprising moments and a feeling of community with the characters. Surely there are more subtle and clever comedy shows, but it is refreshing to see that it is possible to create something this funny without relying on sophisticated approaches and the like.All in all I am looking forward to the episodes yet to come and meanwhile encourage anyone to do a binge-watching session and explore the potential of this extraordinary show.']
