["I'm not an expert on the Bond canon, but I love Daniel Craig, especially after seeing him on stage in A Steady Rain, and I admire much of Sam Mendes' work.I found Skyfall to be fun and exciting. It cost a fortune and looked it.Nothing original about the plot - a stolen list of agents - this is the latest plot for many spy films. Also I agree with one of the reviews here that I read - the list just seems to get forgotten about.What I can't believe is that people pick these films apart as if they're supposed to be realistic. There is nothing realistic about them, so why ask why Naomi only had one bullet etc. In these types of films, you have to just go with them.Judi Dench as M, who is in danger here, is marvelous, and Javier Bardem is an absolute scary, crazy scream as Bond's nemesis. Daniel Craig is wonderfully handsome and in excellent shape. He's a brilliant actor and totally wasted in these films, but I suppose the money is fantastic.Ralph Fiennes lets his receding hairline show and drops his leading man status here, and he gives a steely performance.There are enough explosions, car chases, fights, shootings, and train wrecks to last a lifetime. But it's nonstop action and nonstop entertainment. Don't analyze this type of film too much. Just go along for the ride and hope someone doesn't blow up the car."]
