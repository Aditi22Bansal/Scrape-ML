['I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It\'s about magicians, but also about crime. It\'s also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It\'s been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven\'t seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as "Now you see me" is)! Great entertainment, great actors and a stunning finale']
