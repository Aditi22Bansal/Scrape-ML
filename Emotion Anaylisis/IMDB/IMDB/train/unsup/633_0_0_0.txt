['Yes, I know, the fanboys are not going to be happy with this review because most of them live in an alternate universe where ANY comic (graphic novel) that makes it to TV is automatically an object of worship about which nothing unkind can be said.But the pilot, the "origins" if you prefer, was way below what it should be.Here is the thing. I grew up with the DC world, in real time (the 60s), I have seen every theatrical release of a comic hero ever done, and on this database I am (egad) a "top reviewer." So said, and acknowledging the decades-old battle between DC and Marvel for comic supremacy, I was happily surprised when DC endowed Arrow with rich quirky characterizations and great dialog, elevating it to fair competition for AGENTS OF SHIELD. (The latter has the Whedon brothers behind it, the real "superheroes" of TV writing) I had high expectations for FLASH and not one was met. When I see that tiny grimace on the face of Grant Gustin, I do not see a superhero trying to adjust to his powers, I see an actor trying to adjust to his character. Big difference.The supporting roles in the pilot seem weakly drawn, and the pep talk from Stephen Amell should have come with a warning for diabetics.Sure, this series will find its sealegs over time and the fanboys will forgive almost everything, but the fact remains, a weak start.']
