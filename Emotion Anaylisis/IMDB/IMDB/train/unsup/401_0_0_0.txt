['Very nice animation, it tells the story of a young girl who has grown up in Minnesota but is uprooted when her dad and mom have to move to San Francisco with his job. Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.But the animated movie isn\'t so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of "head office." It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley\'s Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley\'s Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.I like it for the novelty, it makes one think.']
