["Ridiculous movie with one basic thing going for it: The plot is so off the wall that it actually becomes funnier as the picture goes on.Three guys take their friend for a weekend in Las Vegas from California. The guy is supposed to get married. When the groom-to-be's brother-in-law, who is totally off-the wall, drugs the other guys, the film goes into an odyssey of what the 3 guys go through trying to find their lost friend. We see them interacting with drug dealers, playing 21 at the gambling tables, meeting up with Mike Tyson and his tiger and all other forms of ridiculous adventures. Yet, believe it or not, the film is humorous.Bradley Cooper steals the show as Phil, the California teacher, who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist, the zany groom's intended brother-in-law and our intended groom, the latter who has gone missing through most of the film.It's rare that a zany comedy works now, but this film actually does."]
