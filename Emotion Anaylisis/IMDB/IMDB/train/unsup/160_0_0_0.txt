['Baz Luhrmann and The Great Gatsby sounds real eccentric. And this adaptation is the proof. I admitt, for me, Robert Redford remains the only Jay Gatsby. And the spectacular recreation of 1920 decade, the flavor of period, the luxury mixed with heavy kitsch are far to be surprising from this kind of director. But the film has two good pillars, more than interesting - Carrey Mulligan as Daisy and fascinating Wolfsheim by the great Amitabh Bachchan . And, not the last, the shining di Caprio, more portrait from an old Hollyiwood poster than the expected Gatsby. Another good point remains the tragic romanticism use. And the nice Nick Carraway of Tobey Maguire. Short, a glamorous film. Seductive, mpressive, moving. Not the best but real, real good. For details, performances and its admirable director.']
