['more than a film, it is a fascinating embroidery. more than a good adaptation, it is a special meeting. because it is a graceful portrait of miracle and the image of Michael Clarke Duncan remains in memory a long time after the end of the film.because it has the simple charm of the old fashion stories and the desire to respect the book has a magnificent result. because it is a Stephen King but it has not only the virtue to be a good adaptation. it represents a beautiful exploration of the nuances. and a special portrait of emotions. the perfect cast in an inspired movie about the force of intentions. a film who becomes magic. for this cause must see it. and than, sure, discover the book.']
