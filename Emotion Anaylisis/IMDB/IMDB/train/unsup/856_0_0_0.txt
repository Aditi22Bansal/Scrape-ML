["I know the idea has been done before but The Mentalist delivers where others were lacking. I am very impressed with the direction of the show and all the elements seem to gel exceptionally well. The cast is definitely what makes this series successful. They're all interesting, have their individual quirks and make you want to like them. Simon Baker is fantastic as the aloof yet triumphant consultant and Robin Tunney is a great contrast to his character as the witty no- nonsense senior agent for the CBI.Every week they seem to come up with new and fresh ideas for the show which keeps it from feeling stale. And because of the personal back-stories that are continually evolving you understand the motives behind the characters decisions. A truly unique comedy/crime/drama show."]
