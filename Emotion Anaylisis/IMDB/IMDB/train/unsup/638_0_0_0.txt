['So, the WB puts out some really, really bad programming. Then there\'s this one, which reminds me of "Northern Exposure" in very peculiar ways: small town, quirky characters, odd occurances (deer ramming into Jeep; swan attacking Jess, etc.). The writing is sometimes a tad pretentious for its own good, but the well developed characters and the more frequent high quality writing make it worthwhile to wade through. Although I know how TV storylines develop at a snail\'s pace and the WB tries to be a family-oriented network, I still sometimes get frustrated at the tiptoeing the show does around certain issues and situations. It\'s all a lot of fun, however, so if you\'re free Tuesday nights ... then take a look (although, if you\'re on this site, then you probably already have). I\'ve read some of the other reviews in here and it seems to me I need to mention: hetero-male ... longtime viewer (maybe since episode three).']
