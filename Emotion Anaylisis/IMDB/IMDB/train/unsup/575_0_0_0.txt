['The hype is real. \nI just finished all seasons (as of the date of this review seasons one to four). This show is great but far from amazing thanks to some oddball episodes that fall flat. The Christmas episode was outstanding and so was the one about the rating system. Templates for the future of mankind thanks to the evil corporations and satanic demons running Hollywood? Probably. Yeah, most of the world are all doomed because they are foolish enough not to see the warning signs. Meh, my work here is done and this review is over.']
