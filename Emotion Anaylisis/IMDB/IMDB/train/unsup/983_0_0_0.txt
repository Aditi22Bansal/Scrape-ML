['Truly inspired cartoon comedy about title character, an undersea fast food fry cook with interesting work- and play-mates. Hits paydirt on many levels while rarely offending or shocking, and deftly combines fantasy and everyday elements in its stories. Has realistic, funny, and what they would call "richly-textured" characters. At one point I would have put this in the 10 classic television productions of all-time, having over-dosed on the DVDs of the first season I may have mellowed a tad since then. In case you were wondering, I would include in that top 10 list (in no particular order) Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, The Avengers, The Prisoner, The Dick Van Dyke Show, M*A*S*H (early episodes only), Seinfeld, Monty Python and probably a couple of dramas I never fully appreciated. Deserves kudos for closing the TV show before completely playing itself out. 10 out of 10']
