["Based loosely on Mark Wahlberg and his friends arriving in L.A. early in his career. This real life inspiration gives it good originality and a fresh take. Kevin Connolly is the cool headed best friend. Adrian Grenier is the hot sexy new star. Kevin Dillon is the older brother who has had limited success. Jerry Ferrara is the punchline to many of the group's jokes. And Jeremy Piven is the memorable scheming talent agent Ari.Girls, excess and the L.A. party scene draw us in but it's the group's friendship that keeps us watching. No matter what the obstacle, the group eventually pulls together but maybe after some hilarious ribbing. The last few season do feel a little stretched out. Ninety six hour-long episodes are a lot for any non-procedural serial."]
