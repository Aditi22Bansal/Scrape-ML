["A sure instant classic from Pixar. From the minds of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson comes a timely and endearing story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy widower, who is a hold out in the middle of major construction. He is not about to sell the home he shared with his devoted wife for decades. Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America. The trip is barely under way when the old geezer discovers he has a stowaway...8 year old Russell(Jordan Nagai), a chubby wilderness explorer trying to earn his final patch. Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog."]
