["To compare this Star Trek series to any previous one is extremely difficult because this new show is very little like any of the previous shows. Now, instead of a one hour story that occasionally lasted several episodes, the show is essentially one long story...much like a soap opera or movie serial. Because of that, it's a tough show to watch here and there and it demands your attention each episode...something some viewers would no doubt not like. Additionally, the show is much darker and after the first half of season one, there is NOTHING that even remotely looks like comedy or even light drama. No, it's oppressive, dark and dim. On the positive side, it IS great looking...with effects that look as good as movies. But, Star Trek purists will no doubt be offended because this series is supposed to take place a decade before the first series from 1966-1969....yet the effects and technology seem hundreds of years ahead! Overall, it's a real mixed bag and I still honestly don't know what I think about it. Hard to rate and perhaps I'll come back to this review after I see more of how the story unfolds.UPDATE: After finishing the first season, I found I didn't hate nor love the series BUT feel it's best not to try comparing it to other Trek shows...it's THAT different. Instead, just accept it for what it is....and you'll likely enjoy it more."]
