['"Knives Out" reminded me of "Gosford Park", with its focus on an obnoxious rich family amid a murder. In both cases, there are things that we find out about the family. In this case, Rian Johnson\'s Oscar-nominated screenplay really lets the characters unleash their most wanton statements. Like the miniseries "The Politician", it shows what people end up doing when they have unlimited wealth.Definitely see it. You\'re in for some real surprises.']
