['I see fan boys are out in full force for this show even though it ended in 2011. The show was never too my liking and I collected all these comic books, The Flash, Superman, Batman and Aquaman to name just a few.I\'m a traditionalist. I do not care for this teenybopper show. It has all the characters from Clark\'s later life all crammed in to one Smallville. Lex doesn\'t show up until much later in Clark\'s adult life. The same with all the other superheroes and supervillains. None of them were in SmallvilleThe show really is about grabbing two demographics, teens and fanboys. The show is always geared around a few male and female shots of abs or breasts/asses. It has a weak story with deus ex machina in ever single episode. You have more kryptonite in this one small town that you have in the entire Universe, yet kryptonite is supposed to be extremely rare.Overall this show deserves Golden Raspberry awards for every actor, director, writer and episode. It\'s just a crappy show made for immature people."Your boos mean nothing, I\'ve seen what makes you cheer!"']
