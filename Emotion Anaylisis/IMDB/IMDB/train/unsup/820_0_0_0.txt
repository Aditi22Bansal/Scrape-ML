["I'm not entirely finished with the second season, but it doesn't matter as of now. The show's incredibly consistent, totally and utterly entertaining and so easily watchable. The ensemble is amazing, possibly one of TV's finest ever, and the series does a great mix between both comedy and drama. The character development is aces, and it never ceases to surprise you with the character turns and developments. Taylor Schilling is wonderful in the title role, and even better in the second season. This is strongly recommended, and as of now Netflix's best show, surpassing House of Cards. It has tighter writing and a better handle on the story lines."]
