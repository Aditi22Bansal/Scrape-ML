['Greetings from Lithuania.The only word that best describes this show is BRILLIANT. Stunning acting, writing and directing (of each episode).I saw all episodes of this amazing TV show and I can tell you people, this show rocks!!! The cast is amazing!I love the characters who are from "real" life. It\'s really the perfect show. The show is funny because it sets up literally, the most awkward situations possible.In my country, i\'m working in the office, and i can tell you, the things this they show in "The Ofiice" are REAL. Whe even have our own Dwight K. Shrute!This is a truly brilliant comedy, bar far one of the best shows on TV, and with the way it is going, it will continue to reign supreme.Enjoy it for what it is. If you do, you\'ll find yourself laughing so hard, tears come to your eyes. That\'s always good fun.']
