['This movie essentially begins where the film "Man of Steel" ended except that it comes from the point-of-view of "Batman" (Ben Affleck) and all he is seeing is the carnage left in Superman\'s wake. On the other hand, "Superman" (Henry Cavill) has become aware of the actions of Batman and he doesn\'t like what he considers him to be--a dark and sinister vigilante operating outside the boundaries of the legal system. Meanwhile, a psychotic genius named "Lex Luthor" (Jesse Eisenberg) has his own plan to kill Superman and it involves manipulating Batman to do the job for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that comic book fans who enjoy action-packed films will probably like this movie. However, it is not without its faults. For starters, it had a number of different sub-plots which weren\'t allowed to develop due to the multitude of action scenes. Additionally, while the character of Batman thrives in a dark and gloomy setting, I don\'t believe that it suits Superman nearly as much and it remains to be seen whether the director (Zach Snyder) fully appreciates that. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, regardless of the flaws I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.']
