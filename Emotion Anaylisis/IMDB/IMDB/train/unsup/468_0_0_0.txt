['I understand that George R. R. Martin based "A Song of Ice and Fire" on various and sundry wars and conquests throughout Europe\'s history. Indeed, the characters on "Game of Thrones" seem to have no aim except to fight for control of Westeros. It is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.I should note that this show is not for children. It\'s one of the most violent shows that I\'ve ever seen. Seriously, they leave little to the imagination. I\'ve never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn\'t dumb anything down (understanding of course that it\'s fantasy).Having just binge-watched the first season, I recommend the show. Really impressive.']
