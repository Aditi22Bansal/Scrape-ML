["If it's entertainment you want, Designated Survivor fits the bill. It has tension, suspense, intrigue, explosions, downhome family scenes and oodles of that peculiarly American schmaltz where everyone loves their country and is just doing his job, sir, just doing my job and which turns off a good many Brits like me, I have to say. And this Brit is also turned off by the somewhat formulaic nature of it all.This, sadly, is once again drama by numbers, the kind of thing you have seen often before and will see often again before you pop your clogs. And if it's nuance you want, subtlety, ambiguity, something pitched a little higher than just 8pm evening fodder, go to The Leftovers, Boardwalk Empire, or one of several other excellent series which have hit our screens these past few years. There are too many plot holes, too many occasions when you ask yourself 'but why did she/he/it do that? Why not? And there are to many clichéd characters - clichéd liberals, clichéd foreigners, clichéd journalists. So if you want clichés... But as entertainment, Designated Survivor will do, and do just fine.That isn't, though, meant as much of a compliment."]
