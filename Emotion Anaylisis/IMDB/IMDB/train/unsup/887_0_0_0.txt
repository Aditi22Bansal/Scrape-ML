["Sometimes, a series or a movie hooks you so much that when it ends, it's like a part of yourself is gone with it. You cry, you shed tears, you cannot stop thinking about it. Like a lost lover who's decided to go and leave you all alone.That is what Desperate Housewives is for me.\n8 seasons of sheer joy and emotions. A rollercoaster of pleasure, bliss, sadness and thrill throughout.It has quality written all over it. It has one the best script, story, cast and acting in the whole TV industry.\nBrenda Strong's voice and narrative alone are enough to make you shiver, have goosebumps and dream. She was extraordinary and breathtaking.I loved Marcia Cross. She was my favourite, ever since I got to know her from Melrose Place.\nShe is one of the most beautiful, talented and wonderful actresses out there. She just shines. She has depth and class painted all over her. Would like to see more of her in series. Marcia please!7 years have passed since I finished the show, but I still feel it like it was the first day. I'm enthusiastic and excited about it like my first glance on it.It's my guilty pleasure and one of the most cherished series of my life."]
