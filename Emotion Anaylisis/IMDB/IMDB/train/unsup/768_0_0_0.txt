['Review of Season One:I come to AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. somewhat late, having spent the past few years instead acquainting myself with the various DC Universe shows such as ARROW and SUPERGIRL. The good news is that AGENTS is every bit their equal, as long as you take the show on its own qualities. Attempts to link it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe are spurious at best and cameos from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson a bit distracting. However, the main characters are interesting and have enough depth to make this work. I was delighted by the appearance of Bill Paxton in this season, while the suspense levels are high enough to have you tuning in for more.']
