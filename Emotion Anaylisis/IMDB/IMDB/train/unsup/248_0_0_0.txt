['After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with "What lies Beneath" (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was "Cast Away", a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks. After "Forrest Gump" (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland\'s shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He\'s a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life\'s tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...Robert Zemeckis\' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It\'s especially worth for Hanks\' awesome performance. He\'s all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator\'s attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he\'s doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don\'t get bored."Cast away" is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks\'s face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis\' best movies.']
