['I first saw MEN IN BLACK about 4 years ago and wasn`t too taken with it thinking it was just a FX laden blockbuster with a shallow script and after seeing it again earlier tonight my opinion hasn`t changed much . For a movie based upon a comic strip it felt too much like a ...eh well a comic strip . There`s no tightly plotted story , instead we`re treated to a script that seems to have been written to show off some special effects to the pop corn munching audience which is a pity because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do make a very good double act , the humour hits the right spot ( Sly Stallone is an alien ! ) and the effects are actually quite good - It`s just a pity the plot is vague and meandering']
