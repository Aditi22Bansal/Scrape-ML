['Like "The Sixth Sense," this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can\'t say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt\'s character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton\'s narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter\'s role in here. I couldn\'t take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that "nasty" seems to be so appealing to kids these days.']
