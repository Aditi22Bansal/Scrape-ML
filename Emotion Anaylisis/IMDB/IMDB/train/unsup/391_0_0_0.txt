["Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to get out of his rut. He needs to pick up his game with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He needs to connect more with his mother (Penelope Wilton). His slacker friend Ed (Nick Frost) is annoying his other roommate. He's a meek appliance salesman. It's another bad day in his life, but things seem to be happening all around him. It's the zombie apocalypse and he doesn't notice at all. After Liz dumps him, he has an all night drinking session with Ed. In the morning, the clueless duo come face to face with the walking dead.It's a little slow at the start. It takes awhile to lay down the foundations. Once they start fighting the zombies, the movie is hilarious. Nick Frost is crazy funny. It's a great new irreverent take on the zombie movie."]
