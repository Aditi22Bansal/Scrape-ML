['This is a show I love to hate and hate to love. It took awhile to get going. Although this show is about as unrealistic as it gets, you have to keep in mind it is tv..and not intended on being REAL. The characters have almost all been with each other romantically, sort of like Melrose place. Some of the storylines were not that great or interesting but at the end of the episode, I still found myself anxiously awaiting the next. I never watched the show when it aired. Just recently watched on Netflix. I watched all episodes over about a week\'s time. My least fave character was JENNY. There was something about her that I couldn\'t stand. The The character "Chuck Bass" had facial expressions and a voice that was exaggeratedly done and sort of annoying but I still liked him. I don\'t think there was one single episode that didn\'t include the line "I am chuck Bass" in it. I give the show a 7 because the storylines could have been better, but it was still entertaining enough to watch. I was bummed out that I ran out of episodes to watch. The ending was not what I hoped for but it is what it is.']
