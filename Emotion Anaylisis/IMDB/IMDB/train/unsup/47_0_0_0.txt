['...but "Fight Club" is much more intriguing in its smaller moments, where it finds a surreal, dream-like quality that seems to snake around at will. The film is tough and unyielding in its machismo, and although it is occasionally off-putting, I was never bored watching it. The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well. But I felt the filmmakers slipped at the final gate, wherein the script concocts a major plot-twist that just doesn\'t jell, leading everyone to look a little foolish. **1/2 from ****']
