['Interestingly, the idea for the movie that led to the creation of this show is a stone tablet called the "Byblos Calligary" discovered in 1928 that shows a still unidentified language that predates, some think, the earliest examples of written language on Earth. Very interesting. That the show is a blatant nod to the military, is just plain depressing. Just more SF flap doodle that really goes nowhere except to generate more shows in a similar vein that are equally unwatchable for anyone with half a mind. That gotta hurt. Really, I think it is bad SF. All bad SF has a combination of three elements, an unexplained artifact, followed by teams of military people followed by perplexed aliens fighting the previously mentioned military persons.Nothing new there, and nothing new here, except that they have been doing it unflaggingly for years now to the point the old bad has become the new good. For that, it deserves a Brooklyn Cheer. This show and its spin offs deserve to go the way of Space 1999, and UFO, both truly bad SF shows that were put out of their misery long ago, to the benefit of all.']
