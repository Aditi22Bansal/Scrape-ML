["This is tough to call a sit com. There's nothing funny in anything I've ever seen.And nothing relative to anyone who ever lived in the seventies.The show is completely alien to lifestyles and comedy of the seventies. There isn't one character anyone outside of Hollywood can relate to.Trying to find an asset to this show is like finding a needle in a haystack, exactly. There probably is one, but the show is so dull, and the characters so dull and unrecognizable, that you couldn't possibly care.Sad to think that a hundred years from now, some future soul will watch this and think the seventies decade was anything like this. It wasn't. It's written and performed by Hollywood brats who have more control and power than they should. They abuse their control with giving us their lack of inspiration over and over.Such is the case with this pathetic show. If anyone reads this a few centuries from today, let it be known that the show was for a few rich kids, and had nothing to do with anyone else."]
