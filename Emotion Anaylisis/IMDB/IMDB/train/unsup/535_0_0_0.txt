['Hugh Campbell, bereaved after his girlfriend is carelessly shredded by "superhero" speedster A-Train, falls in with Billy Butcher who regards it as his role in life to hold superheroes, and their mentoring organisation Vought, accountable for their actions.I have just binged series 1 and 2. I am a long-time fan of Garth Ennis\' savagely deconstructionist comic, on which this TV series is based. I am self-aware enough to recognise that part of my enjoyment comes from its base appeal - the sex, bad language, disgusting behaviour and extreme violence are all part of the appeal, although the genuine humanity, compassion, and emotional heart are equally important.The TV series captures all this. The broad story arc remains the same although much of the detail differs significantly enough that you never know what\'s coming next, which keeps the series fresh. All the cast members are excellent. Karl Urban enjoys playing Butcher, whose outward good humour covers seething anger. But towering over everything is Antony Starr\'s Homelander, a Superman equivalent whose square-jawed posturing disappears the minute the cameras are turned off, to be replaced by an arrogant disregard for everyone else. The power of Starr\'s performance derives from the fact that he also makes us see a damaged and partly sympathetic child within the monster.Beware - this is not a superhero series for children. The sex is frank, the violence is graphic, and the language is eye-wateringly foul and constant.']
