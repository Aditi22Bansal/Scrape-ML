['I see it as an experiment in the domain of TV series. or just a challenge. because it propose old themes, from family to friendship. but it has the courage or madness/eccentricity to put this themes in a real new package. and the result is not always comfortable. first - because the limits of humor are very, very far. second - because it reflects the XXI century in the most precise manner, with its aspects of Babel Tower to the sexual minorities and parenthood, Ed O Neill and Sofia Vergara as a delicious couple and Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson in a form of chemistry who seems escaping from every rule. so, an experiment. easy to love it. more easy to criticize it. and this is not exactly a bad thing.']
