['I am going to guess that this is another film people either really liked a lot or were very disappointed in. With a surprise ending, it\'s one you have to see more than once, and even then your opinion might not change, even when you know "whodunnit."This is yet another story told almost entirely in flashback. The best part of the movie was the acting. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin make up a good foursome for this story and are interesting to watch play their parts.This is more of what I would call an "intriging" rather than a "satisfying" movie. It\'s decent but c\'mon, let\'s face: it doesn\'t live up to its "hype." To call it a "masterpiece," etc., is a bit of an overstatement.']
