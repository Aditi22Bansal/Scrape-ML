["Life could end at any moment so let's jump off this bridge real quick.....\nYou have the ability to do anything so let's kill people and have restricted abilities for life.\nThis is the logic of season 3. People overthinking life and doing silly things. The guy who I assume is Henry Cavill's skinny brother just acts like an oddball throughout the series. The Sinner could of been an overall great series and I can't believe it turned out like this."]
