["A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7."]
