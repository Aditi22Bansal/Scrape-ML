['Sometimes it happens that even a series rounded-up so well continues to be popular on and on, tempting the producers and performers to exploit its fame and reputation even more. Evidently, it is the case here as well, with additional amount of sophistication and the inclusion of all previous main characters who yet have no more absolutely necessary part to play (e.g. Fernando Sucre and Paul Kellerman). The thrill and pace are in place, Michael and Sara both still pleasant, but the localities and settlement of problems bring forth several clich√©s and predictive events on the account of convincingness, particularly the ones taking place in Yemen.Well, most of them who enjoyed all the first 4 season episodes in sequence, would breeze through this sequel without any major frustration, but those who began their first familiarization here would probably be surprised why this series has been praised so much. Being still above average, one can not fully enjoy it as a separate series (vis-√\xa0-vis 24, for example).']
