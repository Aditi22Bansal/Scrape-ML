["I've caught this show from time to time and watched a good handful of episodes. I remembered it for the lead doctor character's sarcastic personality, but with an exciting knack in trying to solve puzzling cases. His crack team of doctors were also a worthy addition to the cast and gave the show some added entertainment. Not the most suspenseful or intriguing show I've seen, but definitely worth a look.Grade B-"]
