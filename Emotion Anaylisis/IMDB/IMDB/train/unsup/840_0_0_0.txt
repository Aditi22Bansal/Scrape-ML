["Narcos was a great and in a way emotional adventure trip that broke my heart. Despite many violence and bloody scenes it offers top entertainment and non stop adrenaline. The best I liked was the very excellent performance of Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal and all the other actors that played their roles cool and very credible. I want to thank all of you, each of you deserved an Oscar or other kind of awards. I am thinking already to watch it again. The intro song is always very nice to hear. It gives those mini series the right atmosphere and kick to start the Narcos thrill. 10/10. If you liked this genre of series you shouldn't miss Breaking Bad."]
