['There is a lot to like about White Collar: charming cast, good acting and writing, funny enough. Where it fails is in the modern phenomena of binge watching. The weaknesses of the show that you don\'t really pick up when watching episodes once or twice a week come more into focus when watching episode after episode. For example, there is a repeition of criminal betrays FBI Agent\'s trust, and then wins back that trust -- again and again and again. When watching the show periodically you don\'t think about it so much, but when watching seasons 1-6 in one month, you can\'t stop wondering, "How many times would I forgive someone?"']
