['Bringing Sherlock Holmes into the twentieth century, that concept has been tried before so I cannot say that this new show is "original" but Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu bring interesting interpretations to the roles of Holmes and Watson. Actually, Liu was the reason that I tuned in to watch the premiere. I have been a fan of hers ever since I saw the Charlie\'s Angels movies and I thought if anyone can play a tough heroine who can hold her own against any man it\'s her. She does precisely that in the premiere that I saw. This series looks like its going to be very dark and its characters haunted and tormented. Holmes by his addiction and Watson over the guilt she feels about a patient\'s death. There was one scene where Holmes coldly deduces that is what her problem is. I wanted Watson to punch him out right there! Holmes has never been played as more of an arrogant self righteous ass then he is in this show. I predict that this show isn\'t going to last very long. Oh well, maybe Lucy can make Charlie\'s Angels 3.']
