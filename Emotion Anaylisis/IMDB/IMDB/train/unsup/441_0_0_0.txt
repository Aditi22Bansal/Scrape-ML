["Despite the phenomenal acting of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, this film brings a new definition to the word quirky. It deals with a has-been movie actor attempting a comeback via a Broadway production.It seems that the cast is normal when they act out the play on stage and then revert to all sorts of bizarre behavior, neurotic behavior and other nonsense in the dressing rooms of the theater they are performing at.It goes to show the frustration of acting and alter egos taking over. It is also shows the power of critics, in this case, the woman critic who though she hasn't seen the play, plans to demolish it with a scathing review, as she feels that Keaton and his brew lack artistic talent.The ending is sad, but in life, such things can very well happen, especially when we are dealing with neurotic characters. Amazing to me that the motion picture academy chose to reward this neurotic mess with a best picture Oscar."]
