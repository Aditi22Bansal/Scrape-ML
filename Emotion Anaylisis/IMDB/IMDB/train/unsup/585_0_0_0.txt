["The second season of Outlander ended with an epic finale that explored the time travel nature and concluded Claire Randall (Caitriona Balfe) first jaunt back in time. This season explored new annals of history traveling to Paris then back to Scotland and jumping back and forth through time. There was a bit of a slow down when Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and Claire first returned to Scotland. In Paris, Jamie and Claire sought to prevent the slaughter at Culloden Moor by ending the Jacobite rebellion at the source, the bonny Prince Charlie (Andrew Gower). This season delved into the gritty maneuverings of the monarchy through the brothels of Paris. There Jamie encounters the young boy pickpocket Fergus (Romann Berrux) while Claire's pronunciation of smallpox on a shipment of wine makes an enemy of Comte St. Germain (Stanley Weber).Their negotiations and bribes are not enough to stop the tide of history and Jamie mortal enemy Black Jack Randall (Tobias Menzies), the ancestor of Claire's present day husband Frank, shows up in Paris to see to his cousin and generally cause trouble for Jamie who immediately challenges him to a duel though Claire knows that if he dies, then Frank will never exist.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"]
