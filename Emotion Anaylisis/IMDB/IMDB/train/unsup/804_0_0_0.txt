['The series lives from its fantastic leading actress. She exudes incredible energy and plays the role of the naive and abandoned family mother of the 50s, who wants to become a comedian, in a unique freshness and brilliance. The series looks almost like a play. This is not least due to the often long and very pointed dialogues, which despite all the tragedy always make you laugh - but also because of the good camera. It captures the New York of that time again and again in a single shot per scene, and is thus right in the middle. The costumes, music and cut are just wonderful. With eight episodes for the first season, a wonderfully successful and short-breathed intermezzo.']
