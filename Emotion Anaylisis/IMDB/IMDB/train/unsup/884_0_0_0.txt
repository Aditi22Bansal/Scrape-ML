['Not AS addicting as TVD, but worth a watch. In TVD rebekah was my favorite original, and i was thinking she would be my favorite in here, but thats not the case.In this show you truly see what the bond "always and forever" truly means, and i adored that. One of the best things in shows in my opinion is loyalty, and this show has no shortage of that. Klaus really stepped up and showed what his family meant to him in here, and had a BIG development as the show went on.eventually you are introduced to what i would say is truly my favorite character(outside of the original family) which is davina. she is bad ass when it came to standing up to klaus.as the show goes on you are also introduced to the long lost sister freya, and at first her intentions are questionable(at least to me), but as the show went on she became my favorite character!.Although sad I was satisfied with the ending.']
