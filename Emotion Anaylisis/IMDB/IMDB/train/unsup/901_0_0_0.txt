["*The OC SPOILERS* Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) is adopted by his lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), who brings him to his home in Orange County, where he lives with his wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) and son Seth (Adam Brody), who becomes instantly friends with Ryan.Ryan, with his simplicity and goodheartedness manages to fall for the most popular girl in town, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), whose father Jimmy (Tate Donovan) is a fraud and whose mother Julie (Melinda Clarke), who comes from the 'trailer park', so to speak, would do ANYTHING - and I do stress ANYTHING - to stay rich, including marrying tycoon Caleb Nichol (Alan Dale), Kirsten's father, and there beginning to tie all the families on the show into one. After Caleb's death she ended up dating Dr. Neil Roberts, Summer (Rachel Bilson) - Seth's crush-then-girlfriend-then-not-then-gf-again -'s father.In the meanwhile everybody has his or her sentimental - and psychological - trouble...Going into Season 3, the show seems to have regained some of the moment lost in the abysmal Season 2, with dry wit, drama and comedy mixed together, like old times.But now that the main female of the teens is dead, most probably the show will have to change tones.Is it going to be good? Or Not? We'll just have to wait November and see...The OC: 7/10."]
