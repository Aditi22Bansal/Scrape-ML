["Bob Parr is the secret identity of Mr. Incredible. His wife Helen is Elastigirl. They battle crime with Frozone in Metroville. Buddy Pine is a sycophant who wants desperately to be the sidekick Incrediboy. Mr. Incredible gets sued by various people he saved, and the government relocates all the superheroes into regular lives. Years later, Bob and Helen live in suburbia with their children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. Bob is aching for the good old days. He's starting to do the hero stuff again with his best friend Lucius Best aka Frozone. After another outburst by Bob at his job, the government is leaving the family on their own. Then Bob receives a message from Mirage offering a high paying super job. He decides to go without telling his wife.This is good nuclear family chemistry. That's the central strength of this movie. This is a family that loves each other despite their difficulties and the audience can see that love. It is fun and compelling with a few good jokes added in. There is the 50s vibe. There is the Bond-like volcano hideout. There are the great superhero inside jokes. This is a well written movie."]
