['One may not think that a show centered around stuffy British aristocrats and the legion of butlers, maids, cooks, footmen, and valets who serve them would make for riveting drama. But Downton Abbey proved as engrossing as any period drama I have seen , sucking viewers into the world of the Crawley family and their servants as both groups navigated the shifting social landscape of the early 20th Century. Downton Abby proved that a humble network like PBS can compete with the titans of the TV landscape. Downton Abbey is the embodiment of excellence. Well written with intelligent and inspiring storylines. The cast is superb and the show rises above the mediocrity. 10/10']
