["Superbad (2007): Dir: Greg Mottola / Cast: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse; Emma Stone, Seth Rogen: Surprisingly hilarious teen comedy that despite its preference for toilet humour, it is done with wit and intelligence. It transcends those thoughts and actions of our youthful desires. Greg Mottola's film stars foul mouth Jonah Hill and timid Michael Cera who risk much to achieve booze for a party in hopes of bedding a couple of girls. Setup stems perhaps from experience but structure is basically one failed booze steal after another until it reaches a surprisingly acceptable conclusion. Hill is terrific in his foul mouth demeanor as he sets his sights on one goal and risks much to achieve it. Cera is more reserved yet also discovers young love. Christopher Mintz-Plasse pretty much dominates the film as nerdy Fogell whose fake ID contains the name McLovin. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen steal scenes as two inexperienced cops out to relive their youth, and see the opportunity through McLovin. Emma Stone plays the standard yet well played inspiration of Hill. Martha McIsaac plays her best friend whom Cera is smitten with and who Hill dislikes. Director Mottola avoid sentimentalism and creates a film that plays both for theme and hilarity. Trash humour and a theme regarding that mischievous youth in us but also long term friendships that are there when things go from bad to super bad. Score: 9 / 10"]
