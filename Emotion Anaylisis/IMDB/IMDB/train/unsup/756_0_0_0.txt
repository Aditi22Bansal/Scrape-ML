['Negatives: 1. LImited, off the shelf, CGI effects. Nothing creative or mind capturing. Nothing creative in storytelling; same old bad guys. 2. No name actors (low production cost) in roles that don\'t require acting, but do require that you can say seven monosyllabic words or fewer in succession while giving the appropriate not believable facial response indicating some emotion. 3. Action consists of lots of hand to hand combat so poorly performed even camera angles couldn\'t rescue the fake punches. Also added were the usual fighting sticks and toy store laser guns. 4. Really bad science (audience probably doesn\'t care or know better) dealing with time travel as if it were like walking out the door. Even more stupid (er) were things called Time Quakes, Temporal Aberrations, Time Scattering, and Time Drive. The premise is "if I can say it, it must be true." Wrong! Sorry, time travel, quakes, aberrations, etc. - not possible, all child\'s fantasy. Positive: 1. You get a bit of history; distorted as each event is.']
