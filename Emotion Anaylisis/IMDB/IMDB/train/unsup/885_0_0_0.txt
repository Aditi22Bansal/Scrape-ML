['Desperate Housewives is a comedy/drama that leans more to the comedy side of things and is decidedly aimed at (drum roll please) housewives! Sure, it\'s a show most adults, male or female can enjoy, but the writers are hellbent into making it a woman\'s show.\nIf I\'m correct, only one lady out of the four leads is actually married, the others being divorced, widowed or simply on the prawl for a new male partner.\nThese are women in their mid 30s to late 40s and I find it rather odd to see a show making fun out of pretty serious stuff: divorce, cheating, promiscuity, etc. Maybe I\'m taking this stuff too serious but I simply don\'t find this show as compelling as say, "Friends".\nI don\'t mean to sound mysoginous but "Desperate Housewives" is, to me, a show exclusively for those wives bored and annoyed with their marriages.\nIf they feel that way, maybe they should end their relationships and do whatever they please, just like the desperate wives they idolize on this TV show.']
