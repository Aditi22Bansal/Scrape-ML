["Dr Temperance 'Bones' Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works at the Jeffersonian (read Smithsonian) Institute in Washington DC. Along with an interesting team of scientists we also have Special Agent Seely Booth an FBI Agent who acts as the liaison with Dr Brennan when her skills are necessary for an investigation, which is not surprisingly quite often.Initially I expected this interesting series would run out of steam in trying to come up with situations where the FBI required the assistance of a forensic anthropologist. Surprisingly though some may find the realism stretched somewhat I think it works for the most part.For those interested in the forensics the science comes across as interesting at least to a layman, much as it does in the original CSI series. The other strength of the show is relationship dynamics, the most important of which is between Dr Brennan and Agent Booth. The close relationship between the two characters is seemingly unlikely because of their differences but it works very well.The series is based on the life and the novels of Kathy Reichs who like her character is both a Forensic Anthropologist and a best selling author."]
