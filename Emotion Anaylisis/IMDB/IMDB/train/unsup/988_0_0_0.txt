['This series began with a cool premise: a Hollywood fixer who cleans up after the messes of the elite. Unfortunately, they barely touch on that and instead have made it the worst kind of soup opera imaginable. I can\'t believe people like this. Who is the target market? I cal this dwelling on family members as the Meadow Soprano Syndrome after that series went overboard on dissecting the lives of the most uninteresting people under the sun. And who the f**k cares? It\'s just an excuse not to have a plot with an actual story.Ray Donovan\'s inner circle is made up of everything from a priest-diddled brother to another punch-drunk moron of another brother, to a loud-mouth idiot of a wife with a very phony Southie accent, to a gay kid, and an adolescent daughter that should have been put to sleep instead of forcing her on viewers. Did I miss anything? That was just the first season. I stopped after that. So if you are looking for something with almost no action but heavy on really stupid family drama then this is for you.This could have been such a cool series if they had stuck with the action. I could think of ten good stories to pursue as far as his "cleaning" business is concerned. Instead, they went telenovela.']
