["What a family! And I'm not only talking about the Pixar family, but about the Incredibles family. An adventure for everyone. Pixar has another great movie up their sleeves. If they continue like that, the Top 100 List here on IMDb will solely exist/consist with their movies in there! Seriously though: The Incredibles takes the Superhero movie genre and takes it's own spin on it. I wouldn't say it spoofs the Superhero world, it just a funny movie, that happens to play in a world with Superheroes. Of course the voice talent on hand here does the story justice, as with the other Pixar movies. A fun-filled adventure that you shouldn't miss."]
