["Rated TV-14 for Language,Violence and Sexual Content Quebec Rating:G Canadian Home Video Rating:PG Canadian TV Rating:PG or 14+American Dad is a show from creator Seth McFarlane, the creator of Family Guy.Family Guy is one of my favorite shows.It is extremely funny with many smart pop culture references.Some say its like The Simpsons, it is in a way but Family Guy is better in my opinion.American Dad is nowhere near as good as Family Guy, it is a funny and good show with interesting characters.The show is about Stan Smith and his family.Stan Smith is an American CIA agent who is paranoid about terrorists.His family involve his wife Francine,his nerdy son Steve,his hippie daughter Hailie who is against what her father does,Roger an alien who escaped from Area 51(he might be homosexual) and Clouse, a fish who'se brain was replaced with a German swimmer.American Dad is a funny show and I recommend it for fans of Family Guy."]
