['The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn\'t necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn\'t easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes. For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.Now I see there is a "an untitled" Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.']
