["I've watched close to the entire series and even though it go's far out it's done well. The entire family becomes rounded and you end up caring for the characters. It's a very intense series and thrives in constant trauma but not like a soap opera (which I can't stand). It's not an upbeat show that's for sure but it's done so well that I stuck with it. Solid"]
