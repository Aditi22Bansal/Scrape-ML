['I admittedly stopped watching this show in season 10, but feel I invested enough time to still leave a review. This show started out so good, well developed characters, heart wrenching storylines... but once the main characters started to leave, the show was over. But Ellen Pompeo continues to drag this show through the battlefield of fallen characters, every natural disaster you can think of, and every hairbrained medical mishaps on this planet and the next.']
