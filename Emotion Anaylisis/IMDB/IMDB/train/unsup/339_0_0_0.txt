['For all the product licensing and marketing of the movie when it came out, one would think that Queen Elsa was the principal character. I\'ve been holding that idea for the four years since the movie came out, only to be surprised to see that this isn\'t the case at all. It was her sister Princess Anna that does most of the heavy lifting in the picture, and is also the one that actually develops a love interest in the story, somewhat without her awareness at the time, but a love interest nevertheless. I say all that without any particular bias, it was just a bit surprising to see in a Disney film. My granddaughter was a huge fan of this movie when it came out, four years old at the time, and singing \'Let It Go\' with abandon after seeing it a number of times. As a retired senior citizen, I saw it as another competent Disney film that joins the ranks of their other fine efforts over the years, though one doesn\'t have the same reaction one had when seeing their very first one around the same age as my granddaughter. For me it would have been "The Lady and The Tramp". How\'s that for rolling back the clock?']
