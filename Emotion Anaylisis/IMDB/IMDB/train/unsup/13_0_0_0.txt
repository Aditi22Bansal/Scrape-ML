['What can you say about this movie, that hasn\'t been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).It is undeniably an action classic, although some people will find it (too) slow moving. So if you\'re more the fast paced action movie viewer, there\'s a chance that you won\'t quite enjoy this movie that much.Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn\'t been that good in a movie since Doc H. in "Tombstone" and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can\'t say I don\'t enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie. Nobody is overplaying his/her part.So great acting+good story+well "executed"(directed)=Classic (imo)']
