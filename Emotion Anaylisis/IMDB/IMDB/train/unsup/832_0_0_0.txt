["One of those rare shows that have been popping up which uses a non-traditional presentation -- jiggly camera, frequent yet hilarious voice-overs from Ron Howard, bizarre sight gags, among other elements -- ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT became the big hit with critics and award shows alike even if the ratings were not the best, perhaps because of its time slot and competition with DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.In its short time on the air it's demonstrated that wackiness and eccentricity in a family pay off, especially when the writing is almost too good for its own good and the situations are so off the wall they actually, gleefully go over it. An ensemble cast that while initially may not say quality since many have had checkered careers in both films and television or are relative unknowns, nevertheless everyone without singling out any actor in particular is at their utmost, quirky best, the story lines are not only crazy to begin with but getting better by the edition, and the hopes that this show will not be prematurely canceled or moved into cable TV -- ARRESTED could fare excellently on HBO if FOX decided to axe it.Uncompromising and outrageously hysterical while at the same time smart and sharp, this is one show that should not be missed."]
