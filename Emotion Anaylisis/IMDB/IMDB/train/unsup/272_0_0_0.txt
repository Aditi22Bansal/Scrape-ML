["Having 2 jobs because you're not sure if you can succeed in the one you are actually interested in, is nothing out of the ordinary. And our two main characters in this, have issues with their dream. And sometimes they sing and dance about them. One of those moments is very early on, when stuck in traffic, suddenly everyone is joyously breaking out of their cars and start a dance number that does look like they actually trained for it ... All joking aside, you have to have a heart for this type of movie, otherwise this is nothing you will enjoy at all.Having said all that, there are different layers to this. The drama works quite fine and there is quite a few different interpretations of certain things that happen. It's all fun and games until certain decisions have to be made, that can be life altering. The leads are exceptional and you may have seen them before together on screen. Maybe that helped their chemistry, but what matters is that this works quite nicely"]
