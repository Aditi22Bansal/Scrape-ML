["This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters. This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today. No matter how many films Dreamworks milk the Shrek franchise for it will never have the heart or the humour of Toy Story."]
