["Buffy was one of those shows as a kid you would glimpse at and not know what was going on but at the same time kind of like the show. BTVS was dark, had drama, romance and it's a 90s icon. Buffy back in those days was THE show to watch. Before Netflix and all these cheesy Superhero shows Buffy was dominating the cable network. Buffy knew how to be a show that can make people relaxtained. It's such a classic product that aged very well."]
