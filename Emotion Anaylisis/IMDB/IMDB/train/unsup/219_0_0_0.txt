["During World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 90lb weakling who keeps getting rejected for military services. Then Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and recruits him for his secret scientific program where he encounters Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Rogers undergoes an experiment that makes him a new super soldier. Meanwhile the Nazis have invest heavily in a secret weapons research agency called HYDRA. Only the head of HYDRA Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) has bigger goals and his own ambitions.I really like the skinny Chris Evans even thought it's odd to hear his voice coming out. He and Hayley Atwell have good chemistry before and after the transformation. Their relationship is better than the usual comic book movie. As far as the action goes, it's all very CGI. That's not unexpected. However the cartoon nature and the overuse of montages really takes away much of the tension. After a good first half, the second half gets into a rambling flow of jagged story telling. Even the climax lacks the needed excitement. This ends more as a setup for future sequels."]
