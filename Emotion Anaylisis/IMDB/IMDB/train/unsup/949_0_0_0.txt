["SHEESH these robots are crazy.The fun anthology series returned with a second season. Similar to the first season, each episode has different animation, for the most part, and only one episode wasn't animated. Even though it's not thought-provoking and rich in themes like Black Mirror, I still love this series for its entertainment.And this second season wasn't different, as I enjoyed most of the episodes. The best episodes were the ones that had horror elements. They were adrenaline-inducing and intense in such a short amount of time. There was one episode that wasn't intense at all, and was more nonchalant and philosophical than the rest. This was my least favorite episode, as I found it weird and boring.Overall, the second season mostly gave me what I loved about the first season. Very entertaining. 8.5/10."]
