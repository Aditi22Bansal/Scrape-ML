["Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been going out for about 5 months. They go to visit her affluent parents in the country. Her father (Bradley Whitford) insists that they're Obama supporters. Her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) hypnotizes Chris to stop his chain smoking. Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends. As in most modern movies, the trailer gives away the movie. I feel that the twist would be more compelling otherwise. It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.***** spoilers *****The brain transplanting is problematic for me. Obviously, the flash brings back the hosts' minds but their brains are presumably scoped out. It makes no sense that they can come back from that. I assumed that the hypnotism had subjugated the hosts leaving them slaves to their commands. That would make more sense but I do understand Jordan Peele's attempt at subverting the liberal admiration. It isn't the obvious path and makes less logical sense."]
