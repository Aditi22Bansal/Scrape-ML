['Having watched Matt Bomer as a spy in Chuck, it\'s not a far walk to see him as a charming, sparkle in the eye, confidence man Neal Caffrey. Starting in prison, he escapes, only to be tracked down by the same FBI agent - Tim DeKay as Peter Burke - who put him there in the first place, who knows more about Neal than he does about his wife. Found holding a bottle of wine - which rather than being a goof, is a device created to drive a future plot line - he\'s carted back to prison, but after coming up with a vital lead in a case the FBI are working on.\nAnd this is basically the three plot lines for the rest of the series; each episode has a crime that can only be solved with Neals confidence tricks.\nNeal is trying to track down a lost love, through carefully created clues that are pertinent to their lives.\nNeal helps Peter with his personal life, while Peter helps Neal using his FBI connections.\nYou know they\'ll get the bad guys, but then what series doesn\'t that happen? It\'s how they do it and following the "treasure hunt" that keeps the show interesting.']
