["On the first 10 episodes, I thought Death Note was rather interesting and different. I have heard of it before until 6 years later, I went onto YouTube and finally got around watching it. Although as I watched the 10 episodes and the second Kira Misa appeared, I just lost interest. I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away. I know he's meant to be scary but for god sakes, he doesn't blink or show any emotions, it gives me bloody chills when a cartoon character looks like that haha! I wouldn't call this my favorite anime but I would call it an anime to remember!"]
