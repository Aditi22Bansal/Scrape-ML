["I've watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this series, and well, ummm, okay, it got kind of redundant after a while, didn't it? Much like the plot in a porno is just enough to string the sex scenes together, the plot in this movie is just to string the sex and violence scenes together.Spartacus is a Thracian betrayed by his Roman allies, and sent to a gladiator ludus. But most of the series isn't about him, it's about the machinations of the Ludus owner, Batiates, and his wife, Xena, Lesbian Princess. Or whatever. So all of this involves complicated plots leading up to fights in the arena punctuated by gratuitous sex scenes...And, yes, the battle scenes look way too much like 300."]
