['Director Martin Scorsese more than puts Nicoas Pileggi\'s Wiseguy on the screen...GOODFELLAS is a high octane crime drama based on the life of Henry Hill. Henry as a young boy, half-Irish, half-Sicilian and half-Jewish if need be, wanted nothing more than being like the "wise guys" in business across the street from his home in Brooklyn. Although the neighborhood was impoverished, money flowed like water around the mobsters that Henry idolized. Henry(Ray Liotta) is taken under the wing of Paul Cicero(Paul Sorvino)and would distinguish himself as he rose through the ranks of the "crime family". Henry was the golden boy until a reckless deal threaten the security of the family. Knowing he was a marked man, Hill turned informant and New York crime families fell like dominoes.Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay which was greatly enhanced with Scorsese\'s masterful use of soundtrack music to complement the extraordinary story line. Just a few featured in the soundtrack are: Tony Bennett, Jerry Vale, The Moonglows, The Crystals, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin, the Ronettes, Cream and The Rolling Stones.Giving the movie much authenticity is a wonderful cast that includes: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Frank Sivero, Chuck Low, Gina Mastrogiacomo and Frank DiLeo.']
