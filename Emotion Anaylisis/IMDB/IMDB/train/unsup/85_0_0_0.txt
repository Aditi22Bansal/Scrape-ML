["for a fan of Christian Bale, American Psycho is a real challenge. because his Paul Bateman seems be perfect. the mixture of cold cruelty, dark humor, the violence as error, the fall and the cynical speeches, the spirit of novel who becomes large, dark shadow who defines as parable the every day events, the almighty monster who is so vulnerable than the compassion of the viewer becomes , scene by scene, more deep, the sex scenes who are memorable, the run from himself in the cage of appearances, all is seductive, strange and bizarre . and convincing because it is only portrait of social crisis who defines us. a film who could be useful for discover the dark side from yourself. and an admirable Christian Bale's job."]
