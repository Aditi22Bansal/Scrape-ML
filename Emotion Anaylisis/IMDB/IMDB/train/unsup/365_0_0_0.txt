['Ocean\'s 11 was the first in what became an unwanted trilogy, but I think most people forget the others and just watch this one.And it\'s not actually that bad a film. It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There\'s lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of "how can you not like this film?" way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn\'t have been a trilogy at all.']
