["If it wasn't for the « woke » madness and nail on the head symbolisms, the show would be really enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is filled with agendas and subliminal messages. The heroine, and her actress's mimics, are really irritating. Strangely enough, it also suffers from an extremely high level of fan pandering writing. And I sometimes feel like I'm watching some « ship era trend » show, where characters keep repeating how they refuse to be your usual cliché. Only they are, just by desperately trying not to be. The horror/gore is silly. Making it perfect for Halloween, but irrelevant the rest of the year. Really, it has lots of resemblances with the original series. Only it takes itself too seriously, to be genuinely appreciated. Millennials in a nutshell... Oops."]
