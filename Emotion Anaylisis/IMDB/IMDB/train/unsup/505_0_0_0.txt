["The Office regardless of the British version is probably one of the best comedies out there. Steve Carrell is a comic genius and I remember him from his days at the Daily Show on Comedy Central. The other cast members are really unknown. They look like office workers that you and I work beside five days a week. His character of Michael Scott is purely genius. This guy is somebody we all know who thinks he's all that and a bag of chips but he's not. The characters in the Office do need to be more clear. They are all rather vague so far to me. Sometimes, I don't know who is which but I can tell you something. This show makes me want to watch it again because I work in an office and I have colleagues like them too. When they were standing outside during a fire, it was interesting to see that a simple fire like a toaster burning because the new temp and business school college student left something there in the wrong spot. They made the experience watchable and interesting to see who would do who on a desert island much like Lost and what movies they would see. I bet there are people who have the same movies on their list too. Long live the Office."]
