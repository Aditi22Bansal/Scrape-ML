["Okay, there are just way too many crime dramas on television these days. I prefer sitcoms. I think the partnership of Simon Baker and Robin Tunney is interesting. They have a lot of chemistry on screen. Apart from the actual crime solving on the shows, Simon's character is a mentalist or a fake psychic or fraud charlatan before he became an investigator and working on the right side instead of the wrong side. The mentalists are not exactly psychics but people who are very in tuned with details almost obsessively. While there are people out there who are skeptics about psychics and paranormal, there are legitimate psychics who don't exactly make a living from their gift but share with others. The mentalist doesn't believe in psychics exist but I disagree. I think there are some things that are just beyond explanation. I wish well for the Mentalist but it has too much competition already."]
