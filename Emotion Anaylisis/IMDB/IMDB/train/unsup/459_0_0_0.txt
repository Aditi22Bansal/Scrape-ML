['I love this show.I can\'t believe that this receiving criticism from users that hail worthless trash as "Friends " . The story follows the life of the comedian Jerry Seinfeld from a fictional point of view ,and his relationship with his friends ,George (Jason Alexander ),Elaine (Julia Louis Dreyfus ) and Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards ).The group keep talking about relationships ,love,movies ...and also causing a lot of problems around them .This was a great show that was always faithful to his style and I don\'t agree that the last episodes were bad .Many shows try to imitate the brilliant humor of this show ,and all fail."Seinfled " is unique .']
