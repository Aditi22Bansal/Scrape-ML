["After watching the first episode of Ozark I wasn't that excited about watching a second. I only did so because my girlfriend wanted to. But that next episode was much better, and I had a lot of hope for the series.But at the end of season 1 I'm still a little lukewarm to it all.The good is very good. Marty Byrde is a fascinating character, and I love those moments where he talks himself out of an impossible situation; it's interesting to see a crime show where the protagonist never results to violence. Ruth is a terrific character as well. The plotting is elaborate and fairly convincing.But I find my interesting waxing and waning throughout each episode. And in general I'm not big on shows where characters hop from one disaster to the next; it's exhausting."]
