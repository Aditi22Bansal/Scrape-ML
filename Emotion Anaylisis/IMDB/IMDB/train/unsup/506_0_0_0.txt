["How willing would you be to eat nothing but bitter tasting spoiled food just to say you did it? Watching this series reminded me of that. What's the point of listening to the same internal rude deprecating dialogue of a stalker as he plans his victim's demise for 10 episodes (7.5 hours)? The usual artificial, not real, characterizations including girl's night out partying, drinking & talking hook-ups. Lot's of famous author's name dropping for some reason. Stalker able to avoid the most obvious forensic detective investigations (actually none) to continue the series. Victims, of course, are less than perfect humans so the sympathy angle is out."]
