['I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino\'s "Inglourious Basterds", saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don\'t realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I\'ve seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie\'s highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly\'s stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in "Singin\' in the Rain".Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.']
