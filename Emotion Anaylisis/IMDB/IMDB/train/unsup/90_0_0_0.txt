['all seems great. the idea, the script, the acting, the details who define each period. and the flavor of "50\'s in the most realistic manner to define it. sure, it is the result of a happy meeting between a courageous and real great director and the best actors for its project around a dream who is preserved by the imagination of each from us. but not the idea is the most important thing. the mixture of humor, tension, cultural references, the chemistry - yes, the word sounds strange but in this case is the best - between Christopher Lloyd and Michael Fox , the wise use of clich√©s about teenagers and family, the ignored guy who becomes hero, all make the story to roll in amazing manner. so, a sort of masterpiece. and one of the most adorable meet with a film. off course, a legendary one.']
