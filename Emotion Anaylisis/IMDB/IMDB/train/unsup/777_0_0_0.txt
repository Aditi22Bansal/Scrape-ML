["I really didn't expect to love this series as I'm not really a fan of legal dramas. It exceeded my expectations.First of all, the acting is amazing. Of course Viola Davis is phenomenal (as always), and some of the others were great as well, and some of them were just right. Characters are interesting but some are unlikeable. Wes is annoying (sorry), and so is Connor's boyfriend. Story is fast-paced and always interesting, and there's always a surprising twist in every episode. The thing is, it did not bore me. It got me hooked and excited, this series. Very few stories/series can manage to surprise or shock me, but this one did in almost every episode. Waiting for Season 5."]
