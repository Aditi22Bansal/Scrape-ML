['This film is about an elderly man going on an unusual expedition to South America to fulfill his childhood promise to his late wife.I have heard numerous praise that "Up" is very good as it touches people so much that makes everyone cry. Hence, I had very high expectations of "Up". I was not disappointed."Up" is unusual as the touching part is actually in the first fifteen minutes of the film. In a short space of time, it spans through Carl\'s life with images without words. All the unsaid makes Carl\'s life summary ever more powerful. What price would people pay to have a love and dedication like this? The subsequent movie is more oriented to children. It is delightful, uplifting and vibrant. The quality of the animation is amazing, and there are times when I felt so sure that they film a real object and incorporate it into the animation. I enjoyed watching "Up". Let it lift you up!']
