["Really Solid series, Teen Wolf tells the story about Scott McCall who turns in a werewolf. In my eyes season 3 was the best season, season 6 was a dissapointment. I praise Tyler Posey for his head role in this series he did an amazing job. Action was the main genre in this series. They did really banged it.It's a mix of drama, comedy, fantasy and action. Dylan O'Brien takes the comedy side on this series. Added with a good touch of horror you have a good solid series.I watched it in 2 weeks and i really enjoyed this show. I hope for a Season 7 in the future."]
