['Let me say I have generally enjoyed watching both Spider-Man films. They\'re fun to view, but as someone older who doesn\'t necessarily get thrilled watching teen romances, they aren\'t DVDs I would purchase. The action scenes, with Spider-Man flying around from skyscraper- to-skyscraper, are fantastic. I also loved the villain in here, the octopus-like "Dr. Octavius," played just great by Alfred Molina.However, there is just too much Kirsten Dunst "Mary Jane Watson") in here and the romance angles between her and "Peter Parker" (Tobey Maguire) are just annoying....too sappy, and they take away from the story too much. A little of it is fine, but that aspect of the story takes up too high a percentage of screen time.I\'ve read the comics and those concentrate mainly on Spider Man vs. various villains. I wish the movies would have done the same.']
