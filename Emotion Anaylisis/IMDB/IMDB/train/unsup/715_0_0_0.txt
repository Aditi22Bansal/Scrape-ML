['Ugh...having watched the first episode of this thing that was my one and only reaction. Some things are best left in the past like mullets and shoulder pads and Karate Kid spin off Cobra Kai is no exception. Putting aside the fact that this thing is badly dated, even more embarrassing is the bad martial arts. Ralph Macchio\'s character in particular comes across as having "zero" martial arts ability of any kind. For experienced martial artists its painful to watch.On the upside acting wise its not bad. William Zabka is impressive as the down and out martial arts instructor. He can certainly act and yes this man does appear to have real martial arts skills. That said I can not find a lot to praise here. Its simply too dated in a bad 80\'s kind of way. 5/10 from me.']
