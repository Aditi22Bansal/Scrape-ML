["We get to hear our stalker narrate 10 episodes (over 8 hours) as he plans his victims' demise. The usual artificial, not real, flashbacks of a dysfunctional childhood. Stalker able to avoid the most obvious forensic detective investigations (actually almost none which makes this series seem technically fake). Victims, of course, are less than perfect humans so the sympathy angle is out. Screen time is 90+% predictable dialogue talking heads I made good use, in saving my time, by ff. Might need help if this was an enjoyable passing the time entertainment."]
