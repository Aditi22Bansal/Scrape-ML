["'Modern Family' more than deserves to be recongised as not only one of the best comedies of the 2000's, but also amongst the best ever.Sharply written (by several 'Frasier' alum no less) and wonderfully performed by a fantastic cast, this show was near perfection for its first 7 years.Like all good shows though it did decline in later years, while of course still being able to come up with exceptional episodes along the way, but the writers did seem to run out of logical new stories and ways of developing the kids when they grew up.Overall though, this was a fantastic show, and one I will revisit regularly."]
