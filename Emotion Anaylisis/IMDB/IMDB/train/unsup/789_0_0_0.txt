["I have heard a lot of great things about this show, that it is one of the best laugh out loud comedies out there and so on and so forth..... I have never been more disappointed...I thought season 1 was a bit slow like The Office or Parks and Recreations and I held on until season 2 and 3 but after watching 3 episodes in season 3 i could not suffer it any more. I have tried really hard to like this but I didn't even SMILE once, I am not even talking about laughing, I couldn't even force a smile because of how bad it is. This is by far the most overrated show in the history of TV shows and I have watched around 80 different ones"]
