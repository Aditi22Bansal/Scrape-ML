["Unlike the other Marvel/Netflix shows, The Punisher doesn't suffer from too much filler, or glacial pacing. It moves and Jon Berenthal dominates the screen. Yes it is violent. Yes he is revenge driven. But he has a reason and the reason is always clear. The supporting cast is very good, and for those who care, very diversified. The man who betrays him and who Frank turns into Jigsaw is a worthy adversary. But in the end, the show is propelled by Berenthal, who also overshadowed the second season of Daredevil."]
