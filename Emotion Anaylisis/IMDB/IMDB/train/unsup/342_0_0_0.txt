["When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one."]
