['The feelings about it , seeing time by time, are less clear. It is a good film but the references are so obvious, the clash against aspects of near reality so present, than it is very hard to be real enthusiatic. Sure, it can be a warning, portrait of dictatorship, definition of high need of freedom, a form of parody, use of Gunpower plot, Brave New World or 1984 for a sort of manifesto. So, it is good as answer of frustrations, conspiracy theories or people under tyranies. But can it be more ? Sure , Natalie Portman gives a good role, John Hurt reminds 1984 for the change of places, but, after a time, the film, source of enthusiasmus after the first discover of it, seems too... simplistic. But, sure, its virtues are not insignificant.']
