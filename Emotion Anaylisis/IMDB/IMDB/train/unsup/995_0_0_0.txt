["The creator of this amazing show is a true visionary.He brings to life the vision of a greater future of connectedness, acceptance and unity in a way no other show I've ever seen does it.I'm not gonna go into the story itsself, many other reviews have done this.All I want is ask: What prejudices do you and I have? In what ways can you and I get rid of these prejudices? Why not be open and curious instead of hatefull and narrow-minded?ps: The -1 star is for the massive overuse of slow-mo kissing scenes and a rushed, but thankfully still enjoyable and somewhat satisfying finale."]
