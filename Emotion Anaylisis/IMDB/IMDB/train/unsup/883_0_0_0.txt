["_February 2020_Season 5 got to my throat as it unfolded, it was sad and depressing not to see Hayley; I knew she will die in the season, I just didn't know when and how. Today, I reached that fateful episode...Never have I felt so sad and beaten for the fate, endured pain and untimely death of a beloved character. She died heroically and selflessly saving her loved one. Her facial expressions in her last moments still haunt me.\nMy throat is clamped and my eyes are bright.I loved you Hayley. I loved your kindness, strength and beauty. You were a wonderful being, a warrior and a true hero.May you find peace, comfort and solace wherever you are.RIP\n(On season 1)\nA series where the production value is being crushed by the depressing atmosphere and the truly uninteresting unfolding of stories and events.A series where the actors and actresses are tremendously talented, try their best, but, throughout each season, the dismay and consternation keep getting to your throat and clamp it hard.A series where almost everything is theatrical, fake and out of place.An ensemble of events and storylines, which lack brightness, luster and fail to nurture viewers' attention.\nThe rating is for its production value and stellar acting, which cannot be ignored.\nPhoebe Tonkin and Claire Holt are gorgeous in their respective roles and a joy to watch.(Before season 4)\nEnjoyably, It gets better season after season."]
