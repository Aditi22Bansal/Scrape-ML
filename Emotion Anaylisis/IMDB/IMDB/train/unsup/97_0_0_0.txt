['I think the audience for "Se7en" is rather self-selecting. If you don\'t mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or \'nice\', then you wouldn\'t even consider watching this in the first place. While I don\'t think I\'d put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn\'t a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it\'s natural I\'d get to it sooner or later.As for the film, I won\'t say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it\'s the sort of thing you\'d normally watch, watch away and enjoy.']
