['Jaba the Hut and Ewoks and the confession of Darth Vader. intensity of fights. emotional tension. and the revelation who reminds one of the Jung archetypes. Return of the Jedi has all elements to be great. and this fact does it special. for the humor, for the characters, for the revenge and for the story of Darth Vader who becomes a human been after the long status as somber , imposing statue. the fight between Luke and the Emperor, the face behind the cold mask , the words of the agonizing leader, the field of the answers and victories, it has the virtue to be the right solution to questions and expectations and speculations. and this is the good point. the bad point - maybe the details who, in few cases, are ignored for comfortable sketches of situations for the benefit of global idea. short, the end of old fashion perspective about Star Wars.']
