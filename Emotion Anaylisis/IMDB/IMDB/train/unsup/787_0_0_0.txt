["Clever, hilarious comedy.A behind-the-scenes look at the the cast and crew of The Girly Show (TGS), an NBC skit-comedy program. Centres on the executive producer of the show, Liz Lemmon (played by Tina Fey), her boss, GE/NBC executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).Created by Tina Fey, of SNL fame, 30 Rock is incredibly clever, especially in its references to topical events and in poking fun at the entertainment industry. Quite over-the-top at times, and delightfully so. The jokes come thick and fast, sometimes too fast - you've hardly digested one and the next one is upon you. If there is a negative, that is it - with the humour being so clever, you need some breathing space to sometimes get the jokes and being so snappy, you can easily miss things.Great performances and perfect casting. Alec Baldwin probably has the toughest gig, as his character is right-wing and capitalist to the extreme and is a living parody of not just the entertainment industry but business executives in general. Also, before this Baldwin was really considered only a drama-movie actor, so this is quite a change for him. He carries it off with aplomb.A classic and classy comedy series."]
