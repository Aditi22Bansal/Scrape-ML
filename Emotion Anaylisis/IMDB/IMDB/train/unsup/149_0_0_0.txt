['So, the series comes to an end, with Harry and his friends in the big showdown with Voldemort. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" continues the style that the series began to adopt in part 5, as a look at resistance to totalitarianism: you may recall that the Death Eaters aim to "purify" the wizarding world by eliminating anyone whom they don\'t consider a "real" wizard.Obviously, the movie can\'t really compare to the book, but I still found it to be a good conclusion to the series. It was always good to see that, as with the books, each successive movie got more mature and complex. Therefore, I recommend it, even if it isn\'t the ultimate masterpiece.']
