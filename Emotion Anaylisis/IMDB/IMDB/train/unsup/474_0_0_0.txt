["Lucifer is a great show, a lot of it is the charming and amusing devil we all love to see. The strength of this show is the balance it strikes between the detective work and the biblical/divine elements. The greatest punch is delivered when one drives the other. Lucifer made a strong start and I think the first seasons were it's best. Low points include too much of the detective work and less biblical elements, it then resembles CSI more and more. You don't want another detective show. Less time should also be devoted to side characters like Maze. They are often used as space fillers for no good reason, characters should appear when needed. Overall not too bad. I hope there are more episodes. 7.8/10"]
