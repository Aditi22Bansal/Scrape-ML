["Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power."]
