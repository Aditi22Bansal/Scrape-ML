["This is one of those series you hope they will never get canceled. All the actors are funny, the script must have been written when they were on something, it's hilarious. Each character plays his stereotype at his best. The whole Bluth family has some serious issues but they seem to function like that. My favorite characters are Tobias Fünke, Buster Bluth and George-Michaël Bluth even though I like all the other characters as well. The whole family is so messed up it's too funny for words. I was really surprised when they picked up the series again after seven years for another season and hoped it would have last longer. Everybody looked more or less the same except for Portia De Rossi that turned from a beautiful women to some strange creature which only proves that you should not mess with your looks and don't use plastic surgery. A must watch!"]
