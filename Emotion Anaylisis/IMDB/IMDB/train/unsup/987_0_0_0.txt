["Copied the Sopranos with the nagging wife and two brats for kids that are a pain to watch every time that they are in a scene.\nRay is carrying this whole show and as soon as the story lines start to filter out into his brother's, the family and father things get unwatchable fairly fast.This show should have been cancelled after the mess of Season 5. Fans had to petition for it to continue for Sea 6 and again for Sea 7. No luck for an actual ending and Season 8 as the producers probably couldn't figure out a decent enough ending. Good thing. As bad as this was crashing I'm positive it would have ended much like the Sopranos in a restaurant, with nothing happening, and a black screen for 40 seconds."]
