["Do not expect too much out of this drama, but Schitt's Creek has it's way to entertain the viewer, with the simple plot and the nice character build up. Thoughout the four seasons (that's where I'm now!!) the characters experianced huge changes that didn't come overnight or served to you in the gasp of a few episodes. So, because it manages to entertain and it didn't follow the same plot and theme for all its seasons, 7 out of 10."]
