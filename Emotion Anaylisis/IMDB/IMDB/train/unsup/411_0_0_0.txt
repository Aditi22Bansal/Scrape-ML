['I\'d never heard of Audrey Tautou when "Le fabuleux destin d\'Amelie Poulain" (called "Amelie" in English) came out, but I gotta say that she is one great actress (not to mention really hot). This movie of course casts her as a young vivacious Parisian who sets up relationships between people, and then begins looking into her own potential love life.I swear that I can\'t find anything bad to say about this movie; it was done perfectly in every way. Jean-Pierre Jeunet would later cast Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon in the equally good - if gut-wrenchingly violent - "Very Long Engagement". It all continues his well done streak started by "Delicatessen" and "The City of Lost Children" (he also directed "Alien: Resurrection", but that\'s another story).All in all, you\'re sure to love every aspect of "Amelie". I\'m eager to see how Audrey Tautou does playing Sophie in "The Da Vinci Code".']
