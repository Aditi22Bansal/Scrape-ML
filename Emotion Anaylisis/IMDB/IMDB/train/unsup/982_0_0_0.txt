['at first sigh - cruel, cold and strange. at second sigh - cold and strange. in final - only honest. because it is not a series about a prison. only about life. it has not humor or romantic crumbs but it is great. because the speech about existence rooms is direct. not escapes, not masks. only a voice and a lot of faces. rules, crimes, gestures, fight for dominate. and some sparkles of feelings. but in precise form. not, it is not a story. only an extraordinary work. it is itself. not a copy. not a play. and its realism is basic way to transform the viewer not in a silhouette but in the part of show. so, it is difficult to define Oz. because it is, at last episode, short story about its public. evil, madness, faith, families, victims, assassins, groups, teams, fragility as ocean. and lessons about reality of each day. not in skin of parable or fairy tale. only as warning.']
