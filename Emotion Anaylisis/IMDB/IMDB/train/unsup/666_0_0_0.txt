["I would give it six stars if possible. \n1. Great cinematography especially color effects; angles; editing. \n2. Really intelligent dialogue for a crime series. \n3. Acting - top of the game. \n4. Storyline creative; challenging; unexpected twists. Doesn't contain the often used filler to sell more time - always contributing to story. \n5. Up there with True Detective; Orange is the New Black; Game of Thrones; Orphan Black; The Wire; Sherlock; Peaky Blinders."]
