['The film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. I know places and people that might pass for the world in The Killing. I have witnessed people fall apart because of those around them. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is effective. This is the kind of film that truly proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people. All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, with violent dogs barking everywhere.']
