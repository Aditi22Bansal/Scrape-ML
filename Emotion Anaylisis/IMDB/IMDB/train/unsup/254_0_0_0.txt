['Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is the son of Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) and Walt McCandless (William Hurt) and older brother of Carine McCandless (Jena Malone), When he graduates from Emory University, he has grade to join Havard. Instead, he gives the savings for charity and decides to travel to Alaska to live in the wilderness using the alias Alexander Supertramp. Along his journey, Alex meets persons that supports and like him. But he proceeds with his of hermit with tragic end. "Into the Wild" is a long and overrated film based on the true story of the tragic journey of a spoiled and selfish dreamer. After graduating, Chris McCandless decides to leave his life of petit bourgeois, his family, his possessions and achievements because he has two childhood traumas: he learnt that their parents were not married when he was younger and he witnessed their arguments. Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory explanation for such drastic attitude. Chris does not send news to his parents since he hates them. But his sister suffers with the absence of news from her brother and he is so selfish that he does not call or write a letter even for her. Another strange point is no reference to drugs in the hippie camps. Therefore, the story is unpleasant and weird as a drama. The cinematography and the locations are the best this movie can offer to the viewer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Na Natureza Selvagem" ("Into the Wilderness")']
