["It's the adventures of an extended family. Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) is the patriarch with younger new wife Gloria Delgado (Sof√\xada Vergara) and stepson Manny (Rico Rodriguez). His gay son Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Mitchell's partner Cameron Tucker (Eric Stonestreet) are adopting a baby girl. Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) with three children; Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould).Ed O'Neill is TV royalty. Having Sofia Vergara as his wife is simple comedic genius. She is a Latina more cartoonish Peggy. Bowen and Burrell are the perfect comedic married couple. The kids are great. At the beginning, Ferguson and Stonestreet brings the show to a next level of relevance. The genius there is that the guys are lovable and regular folk. They normalize a gay married couple and them adopting a baby. These are likeable people in a likeable family. Their simple loveliness is their best aspect. It lasted eleven seasons with a diminishing return over the years. It's good."]
