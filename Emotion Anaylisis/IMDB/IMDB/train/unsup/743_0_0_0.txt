['For some reason I stopped following this show long time ago, even before tenth season I think. Recently, again for some inexplicable reason, it came to my mind and I decided to start it all over, from season one, but this time I\'m gonna finish it, or better to say catch it, because I hope it will never end. This morning I finished first season. There\'s nothing better than healthy laughter with morning coffee. After 20 years this season is still fresh and hilarious. One of the strongest tens I ever gave.10/10"There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it\'s just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with." - chthon2']
