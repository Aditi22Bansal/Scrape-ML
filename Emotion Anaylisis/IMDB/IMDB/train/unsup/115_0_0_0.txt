['A great follow up to the matrix, reloaded adds more awesome Kung-fu fight scenes and killer action. The cgi and fight coordination are so well done, and comparable to the first movie. The storyline is well developed and has a good flow. The acting is good from the whole cast and the characters themselves well developed.']
