['Pixar\'s "Up" is a colorful animation adventure film about the journey of a 78-year-old man to make a long-cherished dream come true. Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of "It\'s a Wonderful Life" - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen\'s, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.I don\'t generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty. It has a lot to say about love, the generations helping one another, and following your dreams. A real winner.']
