["This show Archer is hilarious I love the relationship between the characters. It seems they are all dysfunctional people that can't stop having sex with each other. I also, love the sexist, racist and stupid jokes. I love the episode of the ocelot and Archer on the train and he yells at the ocelot. I love the fact that Katya and Archer kept falling in love. And I love the whole crazy Barry skits! This show is also hilarious with Aisha Tyler voicing Lana Kane always has me laughing at the fake hatred for Archer and how its actually her trying to hide her emotions that she is in love with Archer and the same thing happens with Archer to Lana."]
