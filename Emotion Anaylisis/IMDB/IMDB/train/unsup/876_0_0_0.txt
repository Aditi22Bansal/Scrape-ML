["Do we need another spionage series? If it's well done why not. I just finished the first season and it was entertaining, with a good story and some suspense. It's not at the same level as Homeland or The Americans, which are both top shows about spionage, but it's good enough to have a nice evening, or in my case a couple of binge watching evenings. To me the minor point is John Krasinski playing Jack Ryan. I can't help it but I just can't see him as a CIA agent. He should stick with his funny romantical characters. But besides that it's a good series, and I can see it making several seasons without being boring."]
