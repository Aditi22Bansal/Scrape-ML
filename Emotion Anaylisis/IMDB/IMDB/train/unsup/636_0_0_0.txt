["Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant mind who often ends up in the murkier part of the law to make ends meet. He gets paid for taking the bar exam for other people. He delivers a case of weed for his drug dealing best friend. He avoids the police and ends up in a job interview with lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). As the ace closer of his firm, Harvey often use his instincts to skirt the law and in this case, he decides to hire the law school dropout without a law licence. It's a big deal since it's fraud and the firm only hires Harvard grads. Harvey has his plugged-in secretary Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), rival litigator Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), and mentor Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). Mike falls at first sight for beautiful paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle).This is mostly fun although nine seasons is too long by half. It's over-wrought to the point that the constant yelling becomes a part of the motif of the show. Another part of the motif must be the Toronto for New York non-descript business buildings. As often is the case, the best has to be the cast of characters and the actors inhabiting those roles. It's a great group of actors including a future princess. It's fun to hang out with them in their suits."]
