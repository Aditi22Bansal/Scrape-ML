["I watched around 4 seasons before until I started losing interest cause me and my mom used to watch together. I'm giving another chance and really appreciate this terrorist/CIA based show! Damien Lewis among so many others are so great; the acting is incredible which is understandable Homeland has lasted so long. I absolutely love the beginning credits and gripping story."]
