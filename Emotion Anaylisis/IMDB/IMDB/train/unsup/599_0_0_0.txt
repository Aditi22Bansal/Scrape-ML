["It's always sunny in Philadelphia is one of the best shows on television. A lot of the shows on TV are good. But there are some that are bad. This show is far from it. It's so crazy and insanely funny... I can't describe it to you. There are many likable characters on the show. My favorite is played by an Olsen sister. An Olsen sister who nobody knows about. They should know about her, because she's great. Also, Danny Devito's character is very funny.The show is actually pretty insane at many times. There are people getting stabbed, in The Christmas special, I think one of the characters bites someone. It's crazy. My favorite show on television is Curb your enthusiasm with Larry David, and that show is rated R too. Those shows are better. The R rated ones. This is one of them. and this is one of the better shows on television today."]
