["STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) *** Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, (Voice of Frank Oz), Billie Lourd, Joonas Suotamo, Jimmy Vee, Justin Theroux, Warwick Davis, (Voice of Joseph Gorden-Levitt). The latest chapter in the phenomenal sci-fi fantasy adventure franchise takes up with the Rebellion alliance once again fighting the evil Empire for peace in the galaxy and having a reunion of sorts with brother and sister Luke & Leia (Hamill and Fisher, in her swan song, both the heart and soul of the film and both amazingly the best things about the film overall too). Director Rian Johnson brings out all the guns with amazing CGI fireworks (many battles and kick-ass light saber stand-offs) yet overall the screenplay he has cooked up fails with the new characters (which I will not mention since they all are rather lame and seriously Del Toro - your check is in the mail for sleepwalking thru this; shameful!) and some unusual shots of humor (taking pages out of Monty Python and Spaceballs) but continues the traditional theme of uniting via The Force to find your true inner spirit (Ridley and Driver excel as the new life force - yes, pun intended) and resolve."]
