["I would not be surprised if a survey of the regular watchers revealed that the guys watched it just for Stana Katic & the girls watched it just for Nathan Fillion.They were running a repeat of the first 6 seasons around these parts and I used to watch it every night at dinner time.They first season was good but then it started going downhill pretty fast. A back-story about Kate's mother that became more and more atrocious as the show dragged on. Saving the whole of New York simply by yanking all the wires on a massive bomb.......the list of stupidity is endless.The suspense in every show is the joke part. It would take a 12 year old around 5 minutes to predict who would be the culprit with 90% accuracy.This show must be right up there alongside Jersey Shore and Keeping up with the Kardashians.Terrible show aimed at people with limited thinking ability.Its amazing that it is still on. I would have thought that the studios would have pulled the plug a long long time ago.Everyone who has ever seen the show is a lesser human being for having seen this show."]
