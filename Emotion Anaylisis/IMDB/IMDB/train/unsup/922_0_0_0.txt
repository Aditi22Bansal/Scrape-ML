["Positives: \n1. Addresses, mostly from a teen perspective, bullying (w/suicide); social conformity & attention; drugs/alcohol etc., parenting; education including administration at the high school level. \n2. Acting & events/situations were just barely accurate, however imbalanced for dramatic effect. \nNegatives:\n1. Dragged w/too many editing flashbacks; time filling trivial; needless over indulgent acting & made-up situations. \n2. Overacting & over-characterization for dramatic effect (made for TV so what to expect?) gives a misleading portrait of typical high school behavior.\nMost important was the lack of understanding in the portrayal of the counselor (and other administrators, and teachers to some extent). There are many legal impediments for school personnel to pursue personal topics or to restrain acting out even when very disruptive or harmful. \n3. Most students are actually boringly good conscientious students, although many know how far they can go to take up class time with talk & swagger. \n4. Next season I'm sure they're go the gun angle."]
