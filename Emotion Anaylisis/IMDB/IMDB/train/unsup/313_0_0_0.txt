["I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."]
