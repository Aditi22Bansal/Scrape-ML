["Quirky describes both Jim Carey and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. Michael Gondry directs this exercise in futile love and heartbreak. Joel(Carey)and Clementine(Kate Winslet)are a couple who's relationship has ran its course. Experimental technology allows Clementine to have any and all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Joel reluctantly decides to do the same, but in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind and struggles to keep those memories he wishes to cherish. This romantic Sci-Fi is clever, humorous, heartbreaking and very entertaining. Rounding out the cast: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. The story is a definite head spinner. I was most impressed with Winslet and her various hair colors...tangerine being my favorite. And if nothing else; how can a movie with Dunst dancing in her panties be bad? A decent soundtrack keeps the flick changing gears. Listen for ELO, Beck and The Willowz."]
