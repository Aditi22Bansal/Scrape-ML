["I haven't seen a series in a long time that has such a simple story told - dadg already old school. The story follows a strictly straightforward action, without complicated side paths. That works amazingly well in a modern series era, in which storytelling in particular is constantly being tried to increase. At Sons of Anarchy everything stays simple, direct and in your face. Just like the clientele in which the series plays. Angry rocker gangs that fight through life with brutality and simple laws. Amazingly entertaining and sometimes shocking for such a genre."]
