["This was one interesting show, essentially it defined comedy for the millenial\ngeneration.Three men, three women typical of young people as they like to see themselves\ndecide to room together in New York City, rents being what they are. The women\nwere Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston,and Courtney Cox. The guys are David\nSchwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc.With six characters from different backgrounds there was a chance to bring\nin girlfriends, boyfriends, relations of all kinds in a whole range of plot situations for episodes. One of the reasons the show clicked.The bigger reasons was however the chemistry between the six. You can never\ntell, you just hope you make the right casting and the audience likes the ensemble. That's sheer luck at times.I know my nieces of the younger generation really dug this show as they\nentered their teen years. I kind of liked it myself"]
