["Gobsmacked at the news that this show has been cancelled after only three seasons!Currently, if a series doesn't have social messages central to every plot, they won't be supported, and abandoned.With imbecilic agenda shows like Arrow/Flash/Legends/Supergirl continuing to survive in an era where the wrong people are making these propaganda decisions, it's obvious that there won't be much chance for another high caliber show as this one to make an appearance any time soon.***For fans of The Expanse, fortunately, there's an option. There are a stack of books available to continue the saga! (Unfortunately, it will upset you even more when you see how awesome future seasons of this series was going to be, once you read where the incredible story was taking us!)\nThey are all also in audible book form. No CGI can duplicate your imagination."]
