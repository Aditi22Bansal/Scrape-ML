["I'm beyond fascinated by the study of the criminals as weird as they may sound so this hit the spot to me kinda like a delicious meal! The other thing is David Fincher the director of the pilot is one of my all time favorite humans/famous beings! Mindhunter has a wonderful tranquil ambient soundtrack throughout and immersive acting. It'll creep you out, intrigue you, and even make you wanna sympathize with many of the characters.Also I'm rewatching for the second time, I originally saw when back in its prime and loving every bit again, I'm sure season 2 is just as good; I'll watch that soon. They're needs to be a lot more adult crime shows rated TV-MA, it's a million times better than most! Highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind learning about monsters that did sinister crimes!"]
