['Terrific and believable escape via troubled twosome. Life wasn\'t promised to be easy for Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper), spending eight months in a mental institution following his painful divorce only to be court ordered to move back home with his parents. Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro)and Delores(Jacki Weaver)try to understand their bipolar son, who insists on trying to cope with life without his medication in pursuit of a healthy living regime with hopes of reuniting with his ex-wife. Pat is looking hard for the "silver linings" in his life, when he meets another troubled soul, Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a self-proclaimed slut and woman of mystery since the death of her husband. Things really get complicated when the upbeat Tiffany offers to help the pathetic Pat reconnect with his ex. In return the fetching Tiffany wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition. Could this be a therapeutic aid in their individual therapy or a step toward a meaningful relationship between them. Lawrence is adorable, witty and hilarious. Cooper is as confusing as De Niro is deadpan funny. And the use of Stevie Wonder\'s "My Cherie Amour" is brilliant. Rounding out the cast: Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles, Anupam Kher, Shea Wingham and Paul Herman.']
