['The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table. It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads. Diabolically clever satire.Guide: F-word. No sex. Butt nudity at end of film.']
