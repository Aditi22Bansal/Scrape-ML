["Well, at least almost nothing. 20+ episodes is just way too much of pointless conversations in combination with more or less interesting twists. If it would have been condensed into half it could have been a good show. There is suspense, thrill, depth, intelligence and moral but also randomness, repetition, cliche and shallowness. Maybe I miss the point of my 1st anime series but from a pure entertainment side it's in my POV average at best."]
