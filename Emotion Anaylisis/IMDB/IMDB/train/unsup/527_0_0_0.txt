["It's s a great show normally wth compelling and exciting episodes. It doesn't need the super villain.In fact this a class of villain which i call the omnipotent villain. In scifi there presence is arguable depending on whether they obey the rules or premises established by the story, but in reality based fiction they are by default unacceptable,The writers justify some of his ability with the smoke and mirrors of Garcia's game but it still leaves too much beyond anyone's abilities.Some shows need to raise the stakes, but this show doesn't, yet they will do it again many times."]
