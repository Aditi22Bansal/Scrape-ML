['In a future world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.When this film came out, it was huge. Probably Gilliam\'s biggest success to that time, and possibly still his biggest success today (2014), though he continues to make great films. And looking back on it, approximately twenty years later, it is as good as ever. They took "La Jetee" and fleshed out an entire world.Beyond the great concept, excellent sets and impressive cast (Brad Pitt in a break-out role) is a story that is so cleverly layered. Is Cole a time traveler? Is he crazy? Is the Army of the 12 Monkeys real? Who are they? And can the future be changed?']
