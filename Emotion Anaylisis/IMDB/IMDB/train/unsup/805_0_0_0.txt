["This is one of the best, if not the best, TV shows appearing in the last 5 years and the entire credit belongs to AS-P. It's one of the very few show that I can sit absolutely hypnotized for hours on end. The only thing I would cut out are some of Shy's singing. It gets a little tedious at times. Otherwise it is Grade A perfect."]
