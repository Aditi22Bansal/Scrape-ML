["Having watched all the seasons, here's my final review of the show:\nHad to change my rating from 10 to 8, because I've rated this one with 10 back when the show had three seasons and the final ones were really disappointing. So, sometimes, you had to keep watching because you loved the characters and the series had grown on you.\nOverall, the show is one of the best comedies out there and a classic for sure. The first seasons were pure gold, funny, fresh and entertaining. The last ones slowed things down and focused more on the characters stories, although they were funny too.\nFinal thoughts: A must see, as it doesn't stray from the original idea, even if the characters changed overtime."]
