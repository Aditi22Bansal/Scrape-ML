['I didn\'t know what "Requiem for a Dream" was about when I rented it, and I was stunned. This ultra-gritty look at several people\'s lives degenerating due to drug usage is like nothing that you\'ve ever seen. It\'s more polished than "Pi", but no less eye-popping. As mentally decaying retiree Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn makes your blood freeze the same way that she did in "The Exorcist". Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also bring to their roles an intensity rarely seen on screen. And let me tell you, I never could have predicted what would happen during those last few minutes! In conclusion, see this movie if you dare. I should warn you that it may knock your breath out. You have been warned. Also starring Christopher McDonald and Louise Lasser.']
