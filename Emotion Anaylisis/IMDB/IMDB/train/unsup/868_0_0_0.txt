["Like a parody of the genre, only to be taken seriously. First season was entertaining and intriguing enough, then it all went to unintentionally funny territory when characters became stereotypical, the acting subpar and the script, silly and convoluted. Complex for no real reasons. I stopped counting the number of times I thought I could end watching the series there, and not feel sorry about it. But I can't. There are no real appeal left to the story, once the conspiracy « thickens ». And seeing Mireille Enos trying to look serious and lost in her own thoughts, every ten seconds, gets old really fast. It was awkward, as if she was feeling sick or something. Maybe she did, who knows..."]
