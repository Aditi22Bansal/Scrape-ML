['Steven Spielberg\'s "Saving Private Ryan" is one of Spielberg\'s greatest masterpieces and I loved it.  It affected me like no other war film since "Apocalypse Now" which is saying something.  Spielberg always makes great war films, and this is his best yet (he also won his second Oscar for his direction).  With violent (yet necessary) war sequences (photographed by Oscar winner Kaminski) and some better than average acting by Tom Hanks and a great cast, this film will make you think twice about World War 2.  The Best Film of 1998.']
