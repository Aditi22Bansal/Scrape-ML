['Certainly the idea of an appearance of normalcy with all the treachery that goes on beneath is a theme that\'s been done many times. Nothing new there. But I enjoy this show for several reasons. It has some actresses I really like in it, i.e., Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Nicolette Sheridan. It\'s great to see all of them working and in a hit. Since I\'m not a fan of the reality show trend, I also like the idea that this is not one - nor, of course, do I find it very realistic. (I did, however, catch a woman on Oprah who swears she is a clone of the Marcia Cross character so maybe it\'s not so out there after all.) I like the fact that it\'s a combo of "Letter to Three Wives" and "Twin Peaks." There\'s a mystery - we don\'t know why the narrator killed herself, and we don\'t know what certain people are doing in the neighborhood or what they\'re investigating/covering up. That darkish aspect is what makes it interesting.']
