["Either too much or not enough can be said about THE REVENANT. Leonardo DiCaprio most definitely earned his Oscar; the movie was robbed of being Best Picture.This snowy thriller is set in the early 1820's and follows the trials and tribulations of a fur trapper, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), as he relentlessly seeks retribution against the fur trapping companions who left him for dead near the icy Missouri River after being mauled by a bear. Plus there will be hell to pay for one trapper, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who murdered Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).Exceptionally filmed, except sometimes the wilderness doesn't seem too remote. But still a beautiful movie to look at. Character development was well done and did not set a problem of who any villain might be. It was a little strange listening to 1800's trappers using modern slang. The sequence of the bear attack was hard to watch brutal. My other favorite scene is the climactic ruthless fight.I believe this will be one of those movies one will want to watch again and again. It is already in my plans.A very hard working cast that also features: Domhnall Gleeson, Fabrice Adde, Will Poulter, Duane Howard, Melaw Nakehk'o, Arthur Redcloud, Paul Anderson, Christopher Rosamond and Grace Dove."]
