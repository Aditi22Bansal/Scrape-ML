['The geek in me loved this film. This is a biography of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), told with flashbacks. The film opens in 1951 where he has experienced a break-in. As the police investigate this man, we flashback to his work on cracking the Nazi code as well as his time as a student in 1928.The film brings out the genius and unusual character of Alan as he leads a team to build a machine to crack the Enigma code. Alan must keep all kinds of secrets, both personal and at a government level. It is estimated this man who received no recognition during his lifetime saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years.While I have heard the name Turing as the inventor of the modern computer during WWII, I had no notion about the man behind it.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Good geek film.']
