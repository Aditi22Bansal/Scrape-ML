['Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by Tom Hanks. It\'s the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in the right place while monumental events are taking place in this nation\'s history.Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is attempting to depict.Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.Gary Sinise\'s performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is also splendid.Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you\'re going to get. With "Forrest Gump," you will get the best of the best chocolates.']
