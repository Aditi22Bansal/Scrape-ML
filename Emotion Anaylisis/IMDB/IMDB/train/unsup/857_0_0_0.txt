['Not in my opinion. Aside from the fact that both shows incorporate a "psychic" in the lead role the two shows have nothing to do with one another. If anything, The Mentalist is what Psych would have been if it had ever grown up. Psych is a lightweight comedy compared to The Mentalist. That\'s not to say that Psych doesn\'t have its merits, but it\'s not in the same league as the Mentalist, IMO.The problem with The Mentalist isn\'t that it\'s a copy of Psych, it\'s that it starts off great and then fizzles, like too many other shows. I\'ve rarely seen a show with this degree of inconsistency. While binge watching it on cable there were entire episodes that were so out of touch I simply fast forwarded through 90% of the show. That happened several times.Compounding that were glaring plot holes that you could drive a truck through. And suspension of disbelief was stretched beyond reasonable limits. It\'s a shame. A show that started out cutting edge with a cast that worked well together devolved into a mess that was indistinguishable from the first season. Too bad. It had a lot of potential.']
