['Starbuck ruined the show for me. Could barely watch her... No chance someone like that could ever stay in the military. Take it from all the bad reviews, the acting sucks... Whoever thought up the concept of the new cuss word "frak or frakking" was a good idea should be fired from any future writing gig. Good grief this show was just a hot mess. Im trying to watch the show as I write this and Starbuck just makes me want to scrape my eyeballs out with an escargot fork. So pathetic. Plunk plunk...']
