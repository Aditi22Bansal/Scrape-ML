["Why has this movie and its director/star been ignored by the Oscar committee? Clint Eastwood plays Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Walt is recently widowed, but obviously has been crusty and rough around the edges and bigoted and prejudiced for most of his life. Still living in the old neighborhood he is uncomfortable with the Hmong family that have become his new neighbors. He will soon reluctantly befriend the young girl Sue Lor(Ahney Her)and her brother Thao Vang(Bee Vang), who actually tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. When crusty Walt defends the brother and sister from a rivalry gang of the Hmong family, he becomes treated as the neighborhood's guardian angel. My favorite scenes are any and all with Sue Lor answering Walt's non-PC and bigoted comments matching him barb for barb. GRAN TORINO in spite of being pretty predictable, it is a heart-felt human drama finding comedy in indifference.Also in the cast: Brian Howe, Brian Haley, Brooke Chia Thao, Chee Thao and Scott Eastwood, you know who's son."]
