["The first series of Waller-Bridge's Fleabag was a legitimate comedy phenomenon - propelling her to international stardom, resuscitating the ailing BBC Three and breathing sharp life and fresh wit back into British comedy. Adapted from a one-woman Edinburgh play - Fleabag's fourth-wall breaking blend of filthy razor-sharp observational comedy and brittle humanity - centered around Waller-Bridge's vastly magnetic screen presence and what can only be described as the most shrewdly melded mix of editing, performance and writing ever attempted. I love it utterly and no praise is enough for what it does and what it is.Then, out of nowhere it got a second series and remarkably they manage to not only keep the tone going but actually build on it to reach one of the most bruised and cathartic finales in TV history. It's a gorgeous piece of work - all hands are magnificently cast (particularly the vastly underrated Bill Paterson who I've loved for years), it's a kaleidoscope of joy and pain. Do watch it."]
