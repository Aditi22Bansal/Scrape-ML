['Unbelievably enough, then it is only now in 2013 that I got around to actually watching "The Dark Knight". Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with "The Dark Knight", then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in "The Dark Knight" is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then "The Dark Knight" really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, "The Dark Knight" offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always."The Dark Knight" was a major step upwards from "Batman Begins", and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch "The Dark Knight Rises" as well.']
