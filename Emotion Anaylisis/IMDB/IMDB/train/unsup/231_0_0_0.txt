['Murder and absolute mayhem evolve around an organization dedicated to keep the peace. You know there is something inherently wrong with the writing of this film when possible annihilation between Russia and the United States in a nuclear war serves as a backdrop to what is really going on in this ridiculous film where the characters are dressed up as if they are comic book characters. All sorts of masks and disfigurement disguises are worn.This is basically a story of internal fighting within the organization and there is constant physical battling. We have one character, a physicist, maimed in an accident of long ago who is accused of making sure his cohorts develop malignancies. Another is set up to be imprisoned.We hear the familiar lunatic idea of making a new perfect world by killing millions of innocent people.']
