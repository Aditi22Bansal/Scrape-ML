["'Smallville': right. Aptly named because it's exceedingly small on every issue of entertainment. Casting, acting, script, originality; you name it, you've seen it all before. It's as by-the-numbers as a cake recipe.This is the epitome of modern made-for-TV American dross. It's one of an increasing number of shows from the States (and sadly, also from Britain, now) that you can actually watch and follow with the sound turned off. It's that simplistic. And it's just as well, because nothing is said that's worth hearing. Camera shots, facial expressions and body-language takes are so stereotypic and juvenile. Subtlety has no place in modern media. Every 'adult' has to behave like a large sexually-aware child. In fact this point is taken to such extreme that there simply are no old or even middle-aged people in Smallville. Everyone above the age of 30 has been deleted! Nor are there any children. Didin't anyone have parents or younger siblings? Doesn't anyone keep pets? Because I've yet to see a cat or a dog. Perhaps the makers spent too much time watching 'Logan's Run'. And of course; every female has a pert and well figured body, whilst every man has exemplary pects and a six-pack. So it would appear that along with ageing; obesity and unhealthy lifestyles have also been ironed-out in this idealised vision of absurdity. This is 'Scooby Doo' but without Scooby Doo and with real actors playing cartoon stereotypes.Strictly for backward children."]
