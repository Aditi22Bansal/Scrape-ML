["I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline."]
