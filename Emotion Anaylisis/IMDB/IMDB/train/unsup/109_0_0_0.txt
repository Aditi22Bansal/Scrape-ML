['"Blade Runner" is the kind of movie that leaves me with a million things to say and an inability to put anything down in writing. Quite simply, it\'s an engrossing film experience. In large part I think it\'s the mythology of the story that grabs me, the history of the Nexus Phase and how replicants virtually surpass humans in their abilities. My latest viewing was of the Director\'s Cut; it\'s been quite a while since I\'ve seen the original with Harrison Ford\'s narration, so comparisons don\'t come easy at this point. Even so, I\'ve been enthralled by the picture every time I\'ve seen it.Thinking about it today as I write this, we\'re only five years away from Ridley Scott\'s original vision set in Los Angeles of 2019. Robot technology seems to be in the news just about every day now, though nothing remotely approaches the wizardry of replicants, but who knows how far things will go. It\'s going to get pretty interesting.As for the picture, after each viewing it takes a few more days for it to completely leave my thoughts. One hopes that the future doesn\'t resolve to the type of dystopian darkness that films like this and the Terminator films manage to depict. The real world is scary enough as it is.']
