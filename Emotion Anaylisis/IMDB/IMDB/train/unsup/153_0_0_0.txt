['This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don\'t like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God\'s sake. This is full of spectacle, "humanity," and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I\'m surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren\'t complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren\'t as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.']
