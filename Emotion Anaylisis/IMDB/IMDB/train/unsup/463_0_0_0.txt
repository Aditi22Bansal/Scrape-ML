["I started watching Greys Anatomy in Season 4 and I liked it. Its focues on Doctors in Seattle who do different operations in every show and they also have steamy sex with their loved ones. Patrick Dempsey in this is so obnoxious in this programme I swear to god he goes on and on about how wonderful he is and that the bloody hospital is in fact his. Grr I hate Dr Shepard but I adore Dempsey though as he is sexy and very respectable. The charcthers are OK,the procedures they do in this programme is sometimes gross e.g one of them had a pencil stuck in their eye,opening up people's stomachs.I liked the season 6 finale in Grey's as Dr Shepard gets shot by some guy who wanted revenge as his wife died in the hospital and he bought a gun and shot some of the staff along with Dr Shepard. I was like NO!!.Its a great show and I liked it even though I never saw the season 1 of it."]
