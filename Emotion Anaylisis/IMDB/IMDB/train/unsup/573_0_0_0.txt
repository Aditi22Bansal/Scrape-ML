['Black Mirror is a trip to the "what if" realm......Unlike its title, the stories presented are not always dark and dystopian. Its a mixed bag, of cautionary, horror but also at times, genuinely uplifting and even moving, tales from the "other side". The standard of storytelling, predictably, varies. Sometimes there is real flair and inspiration on offer. Other times, the tales can be rather unremarkable and occasionally, boring. That said, as a guide, I\'d say this series is more polished than not. Season three, sees a departure from UK only based episodes and offers up imaginings from the US as well. Its a good move, that works well, breaking up the UK centric feel of the show. I like Dark Mirror and hope for more in future. Seven out of ten from me.']
