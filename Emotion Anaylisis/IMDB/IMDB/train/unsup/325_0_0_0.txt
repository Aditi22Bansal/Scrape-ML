['Ant-Man introduces Paul Rudd as our new Avenger. Scott Lang (Rudd) is a thief/ hacker who spent time in jail. He wants nothing more than to go straight and establish a life with visitation rights for his daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). His wife (Judy Greer) is about to move on with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale).In a subplot Dr. Hank Pym is played by Michael Douglas who comes on the scene, almost doing an aside, and says "I\'m still alive." He was part of a company that shrinks the space between atoms. It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first "Iron Man" again which isn\'t too bad, just predictable. The script is filled with humorous moments and a few memorable lines. It leads us into an Avengers sequel which isn\'t bad for Paul Rudd fans.Guide: No sex or nudity. Minor swearing. No F-bombs.']
