["I have watched about two episodes of Gotham and it is just loud. When I mean loud I mean just unnecessarily screaming, shouting or just random yelling. Or sometimes just overacting when it is not needed.Like in the first episode I got put off straight away when the episode began and Bruce's parents get shot then for some reason Bruce just shrieks so loudly like I have to turn my volume down to 10%. But I carried on for the whole episode. I have to say though the actor for Jim Gordan is good considering he voiced Batman in an animated movie Batman year one which wasn't even that good. But I have to admit the actress for Barabra is hot. But don't waste your time with this is you have hearing problems or instant heart attack problems just stay away from it because there are lots of unnecessary over acting, shouting and yelling in this show."]
