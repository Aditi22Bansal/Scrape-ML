["Season 1: 3\nWhat i liked: the show is visually stunning. and the sci-fi concepts are beastly. what i disliked: basically everything else. it's a low quality show disguised as a high quality show because of how nice it looks. the acting is mediocre with some being really bad (like ortega). the dialogue is childish at points, and for some reason they switch between various languages without warning so you have to start reading subs at a moment's notice and i had to go back a bunch of times. and there are so many typical parts, cliches, and really dumb moments. i laughed a lot in this, all at unintended humor. the intended humor was terrible. but worst of all, the fight scenes were absolute garbage. except for one scene which was pretty good, the rest were abysmal. i'm talking 0 star fight scenes. you couldn't see what was happening at all. so many quick cuts and shaky cam. just absolutely awful. you know it's bad when i want to move past the action scenes to get to the boring stuff. speaking of boring stuff, so many parts i just wanted them to move past, like the emotional stuff between elliot and ava. and the story was ridiculously convoluted while at the same time being generally uninteresting. bad combination. yet another garbo showing from netflix (1 viewing)"]
