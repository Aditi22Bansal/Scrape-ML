["Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex- surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu). Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his 'guardian'. The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde'. Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp"]
