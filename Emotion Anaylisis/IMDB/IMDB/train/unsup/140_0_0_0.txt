["The Hangover is a great example of what the former frat boys from Animal House do the rest of their lives. Just simply more of the same.I have no doubt that these four would have been members in good standing right along with Blutarsky, Otter, and the rest. Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha decide on the way to Bartha's wedding in Los Angeles to have the ultimate in bachelor parties with a night in the sin city of the west, Las Vegas.It was one hell of a party, somebody slipped our merry men the date rape drug and they have absolutely no idea where they've been or what they've done. Worse than that they've got a baby in a closet and a tiger in the loo. But even worse than that, Bartha's been misplaced and they haven't the foggiest idea where to start looking for him.If you're taste runs to Animal House and Police Academy like comedies than The Hangover is definitely your cup of tea."]
