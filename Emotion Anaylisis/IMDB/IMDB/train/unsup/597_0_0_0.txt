["While being one of the funniest shows on television, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not afraid to address complicated social issues in enlightening ways. From addressing racial discrimination to poverty, the gang always find some strange way to explore difficult situations in a hilarious way. Season 12 saw the gang actually try to tend bar at the behest of Dennis (Glenn Howerton) and Mac (Rob McElhenney) finally come out of the closet just to receive the winnings of a lottery ticket after a long litigation that cost the price of the ticket. Charlie (Charlie Day) got jealous of a tapeworm and finally impregnated the waitress (Mary Elizabeth Ellis). Frank (Danny DeVito) had trouble with his fluid business and Dee (Kaitlin Olson) became obsessed with destroying the life of a male stripper.The gang never fail to go over the top with their outlandish and idiotic schemes that from filming Mac and Charlie's parents and turning it into a sitcom to trying their hand at public relations. Cricket (David Hornsby) got an episode where his father tries to pull out of poverty, though his descent due to Dee is too far to ever come back from. Dee enacted the same sort of vengeance on a stripper even though her attempt to prove that she wasn't his lowest point lead to a disturbing encounter. Dee is continuously bullied by the gang and ignored.Check out more of this review and others at swiliky.com"]
