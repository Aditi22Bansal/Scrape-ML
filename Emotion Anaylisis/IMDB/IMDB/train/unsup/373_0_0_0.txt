["Goodish children's movie.In the city of Monstropolis, a company, Monsters Inc, harnesses the power of children's screams to generate electricity. Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles."]
