["I'm cross with this film. It has the makings of a really good teen comedy. But there are two things which completely spoil it.One is the incessant foul language. It is completely unnecessary, adds nothing, and after a while it got on my nerves. The sex references are part of the story and didn't bother me at all, but the F word is simply used as a meaningless punctuation sound interjected into nearly every sentence uttered by nearly every character.The other was the character of Seth. I liked every character in the film - even the two idiot cops - except for odious, mouthy, obnoxious, self-centred, offensive, single-mindedly stupid Seth.I'm not sure how much of this movie was scripted and how much was improvised, but the character of Seth drops this film by two grades and the bad language by a further one. So if you don't mind non-stop pointless bad language, and you're happy for your central character to annoy you from the very first frame to the last, then I would grade this a 9 for you!"]
