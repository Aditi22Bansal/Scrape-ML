['/refers to Season 1/Recent years I have somehow moved away from US drama/crime series as I have found the UK and Scandinavian ones catchier. But thanks to some references and promotion materials (incl. IMDB) I have run into series like Ozark - with distinct characters and performances, solutions without external intervention, events developing in narrow areas, thrill mixed with personal intertwinings, etc. Well, one can always question the plausibility of depicted crimes in a democratic society, but if well explained and expressed, then you follow the course of events without wtf! and blah! feelings. And if complemented by beautiful environment, pleasant performances (Bateman was a surprise, usually I am not too fond of the movies he participates) and the scenes with twists where do you not know how to react as comic and tragic are intertwined.All in all, I am looking forward to Season 2 already.']
