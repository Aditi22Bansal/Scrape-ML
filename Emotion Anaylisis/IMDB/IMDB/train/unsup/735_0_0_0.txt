["This series had potential as a gritty yet entertaining updating of the depiction of teens' lives. It's been done before - Skins (the UK version) was particularly good (though only initially: it ran out of steam after about two seasons).Occasionally the series lives up to its promise, with a few stories that are quite interesting and engaging. However, for the most part it is quite dull and unengaging. The central character - Rue - is the main cause of the problem, coming across as superficial, self-absorbed and pretentious. In fact the whole series feels like that, though it might accurately describe teens' lives (!).As mentioned, some side-stories are interesting, but these are not enough to make this watchable."]
