["A little over-dramatic with a cast of characters I hoped would became more relatable and endearing as time went on. Unfortunately, I did not find it to be the case forever clutching at straws to find a redeemable trait about the characters.That fact I made it to Season 3, was probably on a train wreck/car crash scenario where I couldn't help but watch intently. The constant flashback based around that particular season's main narrative became formulaic by the third season.Great for escapism, if you're into that sort of thing."]
