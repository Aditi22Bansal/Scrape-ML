["The show was a copy of TVD which means it had strong performances great action-thriller scenes and constant suspense plus we did not got bored with that VD Helena love triangle but the show suffered from the same supernatural problems the vampire diaries suffered too.At some point they have to understand that killing someone for good and then to bring him back to life whenever they want in his body or in another body it doesn't make sense and kills the suspense of killing someone.I Mean....what's the point that almost all of our heroes were once dead but then somehow they were resurrected again ?so....Klaus father was dead but claus mother brings him back to life only for claus to kill him again.......OK so what the heck ? if they want they will bring him back. that is the major flaw for both shows.when someone is dead....................is dead don't bring him back. it ruins everything if u want to have a realistic show.apart from that if u are a fan of TVD u will love that show too even more better but at some point u will be tired of the same formula.I now reached season 3 of this show and season 6 of TVD and I only watch it now to see how the stories will end as I know that death really not matters anymore in those series."]
