['Great combination of a sitcom with a more serious drama. One of the only sitcoms i think offers major value in its stories, themes, characters, and depth.Season 1: 6 stars (about 6 viewings, 5/30/2021)\nfunny. A little heavy on the drama sideSeason 2: 7 (about 7 viewings, 6/11/2021)\nfirst half is on par with season 1 but steps it up later in the seasonSeason 3: 7 (about 7 viewings, 11/27/19, 6/30/2021)\nSeason 4: 8 (about 7 viewings, 12/11/19, 7/15/2021)\nSeason 5: 9 (about 6 viewings 12/2019)\nSeason 6: 9 (about 6 viewings 12/26/19)\nSeason 7: 9 (about 5 viewings 12/29/19)\nSeason 8: 8\nfinished the series like a beast (about 4 viewings 1/1/20)Season 9: 6\nnot nearly as good, mostly because of an unfunny lead actor, probably not her fault, just miscast. Some of the jokes were bad with a significant downgrade in writing. But there are lots of very funny characters and funny parts, especially with the old actors. Dave franco is hilarious in this role. And i liked mahone and drew (about 4 viewings 1/27/2020)']
