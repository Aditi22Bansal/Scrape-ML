["I enjoy this show. It's pretty great. My favorite seasons are the earlier ones. Season 1 - 4 all tie as my favorite. Then with each season, I like it less and less. Don't get me wrong, the other six seasons are all still good. The story lines are good and the cast are very talented.This show is about the evolution of Clark Kent, the man we know as Superman. We see him discovering himself as a teenager, and what he must go through to become the legend we all have heard of. Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome."]
