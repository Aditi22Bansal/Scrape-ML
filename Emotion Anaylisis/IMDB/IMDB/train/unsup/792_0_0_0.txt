['Hey Guys RegularShow1 here again and today I\'m going to review the "Netflix" Original series "BoJack Horseman". The show is about a TV star named "Bojack Horseman" who used to be on a sitcom on TV called "Horsin\' Around". But Today he is a washed up celebrity from 1990s live Hollywood, CA with Todd Chavez who is a slacker that ends up living with "Bojack". Then there Diane Nuguyen who is a ghostwriter for "Bojack". The show is satire on Hollywood. The show started streaming on "Netflix" on August 22,2014 with it second season on July 17,2015.I recently started watching it and like it. Anyway I highly recommend this show. Anyway I\'m giving "Bojack Horseman" a 10 out of 10 stars. See You Later. BYE.']
