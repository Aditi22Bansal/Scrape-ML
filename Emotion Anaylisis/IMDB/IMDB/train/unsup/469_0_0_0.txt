["This is a television drama series starring Damian Lewis as an ambitious hedge fund king and Paul Giamatti as a relentless and tough U.S. Attorney.Just saw the (unaired) pilot and it is more than obvious that this series is designed to impress. There is a slow building of the set-up. Bit by Bit of information until you get the whole picture of what is happening and the connection between the main characters. Unfortunately is that connection that makes me hold a small basket. The relation between the characters is stronger than it first appear and makes it a borderline soap opera. I really hope it doesn't get into one.Anyway, you have some credible actors, you get to see glimpses on how the upper 1% of the world lives (which is always a selling point since Dallas and Dynasty) plus you may learn a couple of things about the stock-market and funds and other ...mystical things that most people don't know about and could make a guy billionaire in a day or so.Overall: Nothing spectacular so far, but the set-up of the pilot made clear what you are about to see in the 12 episodes of the 1st season. 2 men (yet not 2 different worlds) will collide in a pissing contest (as it is clearly said in the pilot). Who will win? Only one way to find out..."]
