["It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times."]
