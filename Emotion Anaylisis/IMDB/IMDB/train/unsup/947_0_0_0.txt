["Love, Death & Robots was originally going to be a feature length reboot of Heavy Metal; it's pretty damn stupefying knowing the path they ultimately decided to go with: an animated series of self-contained stories on Netflix where there are no true restraints on the contents of the stories or visuals. These stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.Netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'Stranger Things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. Love, Death & Robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. I'd say that my favorites would have to be 'Alternate Histories', 'Good Hunting', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'The Witness'. To be fair though, ALL the episodes are pretty good. They each cover their own respective genres just nicely.If you want to check out Love, Death & Robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto. It's a Netflix-Must!This Netflix-Must gets 4.5/5 stars."]
