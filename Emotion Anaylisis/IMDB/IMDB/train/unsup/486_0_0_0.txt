['This sci-fi/horror series stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard,\nNatalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton and Millie Brown. This takes place in Indiana town, Hawkins during the 1980\'s and centers around single mother, Joyce Byers (Ryder), her son, Jonathan (Heaton), Police Chief, Jim Hopper (Harbour), Young boy, Mike Wheeler (Wolfhard), Mike\'s sis, Nancy (Dyer) and mysterious, young girl, Eleven (Brown) who has special powers. This is a good, suspenseful series with a decent cast, mainly Ryder and good, atmospheric score that has a Tangerine Dream & John Carpenter feel. \nThere\'s also a Spielberg tone, obviously "E.T." and aspects of "The X-Files," \n"A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "The Thing." If you grew up in the 80\'s as I did or enjoy sci-fi/horror, I recommend checking this out.']
