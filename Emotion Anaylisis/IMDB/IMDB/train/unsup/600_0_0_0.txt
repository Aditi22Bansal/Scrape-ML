["After watching the pilot I got really excited with Mr.Robot. It was very promising. I really liked the idea of the anarchist trying to mess up the financial world. Rami Malek seemed to be the perfect actor for that role. But the pilot might have been promising, the rest of the season went downwards very quickly. I don't know what the script writers were thinking but to me they are going completely the wrong way. And that's too bad because I really had big hopes for this show. The actors are not bad at all though, it's just the storyline that isn't good enough. They should more focus on the real hacking and anarchy then the mental issues of Elliot Alderson. That was a real bummer to me. I was going to give it a nine after the pilot but now after finishing the first season it only deserves maximum a five star rating. Hopefully they will do much better in the second season otherwise this series is going to die a slow death."]
