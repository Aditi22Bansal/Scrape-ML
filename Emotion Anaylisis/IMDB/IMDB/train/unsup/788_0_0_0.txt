["30 Rock is a show that you either love or hate. The comedy is very subjective and has stayed true to it's own style for all 7 seasons. I initially thought it was a bit ridiculous and rather childish but then it started to grow on me. Now I officially count myself in the love category. I'm very impressed with Tiny Fey, she truly is very talented and I commend her for creating a show that is unashamed to be funny, intelligent and stupid all at the same time.Now that I am finally in the seventh season I think they made the right decision to go out on a high before the show had a chance to become too old and tired. If you still haven't watched any of the episodes then it is never too late. You may be pleasantly surprised and end up binge watching until the very last episode like I did. I highly recommend it."]
