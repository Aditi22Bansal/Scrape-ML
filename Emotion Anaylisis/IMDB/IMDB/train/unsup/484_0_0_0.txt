['During the 21st century, Ryan Murphy has been one of the people revolutionizing TV. With "American Horror Story", he looked at humanity\'s capacity for evil. Now he brings us "American Crime Story", about some bad things that have happened in the US during the past few decades.I just watched the first season, focusing on the O.J. Simpson trial. In addition to giving a sense of how weird the rich Angeleno culture is, it makes clear that you couldn\'t separate race from the trial. Having watched the verdict read on TV back when it happened, I know how charged the atmosphere was. This has become all the more relevant since George Floyd\'s murder.I understand that season two focuses on Gianni Versace\'s murder, and how you couldn\'t separate homophobia from the story. Without a doubt, our country has a lot of issues to deal with.The point is, this is a show that draws you in, even if you know the story. I recommend it.']
