["Season 1 - Oh I really enjoyed the first season. Not exactly top notch as some other Starz series have been but pretty close. Ron Moore of course gave us great quality with BSG back in the 2000's and his delivery on this series is almost as good. Season 1 to me really was all about Tobias Menzies performance. Haha, I loved his dual role as Frank and more importantly Captain 'Black Jack' Randall. Episodes 6 and I think 16 stood out with a couple of the greatest scenes ever. Captain Randall's conversation with Claire in Ep6 and his 'encounter' with Jaime in Ep. 16 were both totally intense. Some really great TV offered here. Season 1 gets a 9/10 from me.Season 2 - Not as impressed with the 1st half of Season 2 Wasn't impressed at all about how Highlander Jaime and Sassanach Beauchamp arrive in France and suddenly become 'all that'. I mean come on now. Everything just falls into place and they are suddenly hobnobbing with royalty??? Yeah that was lame. LAME I say!!! But the 2nd half of season 2 was some good stuff. Back in the Homeland and back with Colum, and Dougal, Angue and Rupert. That's what I really wanted to see. And the Season Finale, that was intense. Almost perfect season finale. Season 2 gets a 7/10"]
