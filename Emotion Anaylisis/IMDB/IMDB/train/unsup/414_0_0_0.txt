['This film is about Tony Stark\'s fight against the US government and a man who wants revenge for what the Stark family did to his father forty years ago.I found "Iron Man 2" very entertaining! It alternates between adrenaline and mischievous scenes. Scarlett Johansson is a great addition to the story, I was impressed by the way she pulled her character off. Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think "Iron Man 2" is worth watching just for the ending alone. I think "Iron Man 2" is great entertainment, and it\'s even better than "Iron Man".']
