["Lost is somewhat difficult to review as a whole, episode quality varied somewhat, from the incredible opening episode, to the divisive finale. You could argue the show went on for too long, that the broadcaster milked it a little, but for me the show is at its strongest about half way through, series three sees the mystery and suspense cranked up, more questions asked and some good new characters. The final series is a little disappointing, I personally didn't like the conclusion, but I'm sure many fans do.Lost highlights the importance and art of storytelling, as a viewer you are tricked, confused and pushed into many blind alleys, trouble is when you start watching you can't switch off, it's always so engaging. The puzzles unravel slowly.Very well acted all round, I especially liked Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson, Ben is such an interesting character, he adds a lot to the series.I will always be a big fan of Lost, somehow it feels like a game changer."]
