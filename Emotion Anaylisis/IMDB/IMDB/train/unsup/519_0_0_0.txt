['Raymond Reddington, number one on the FBI\'s Most Wanted List, which has been successfully avoided arrest for decades, suddenly appears at the FBI headquarters, surrenders and insists on talking exclusively with newcomer Detective Elizabeth Keen. The series has 6 seasons and 133 episodes so far, in which Reddington, in exchange for immunity, helps a secret branch of the FBI to catch the dangerous and powerful criminals that they did not even know existed. Each episode is a quality forty-minute thriller with own plot, while the characters of Reddington and Elizabeth gradually build through all episodes and deepen the mystery of why he surrendered and why he chose her specifically.Although he was not the first choice for the role and fell in the series just a couple of days before the shooting started, James Spader is even better here than in "Boston Legal" and I do not think that anybody could play the role of Reddington better. Megan Boone was initially annoying to me, but in time the man became accustomed to everything, so after six seasons I even became fond of her. The whole cast is good and their characterization is excellent. The script combines crime thriller with drama and occasional comic-relief moments. Technical quality is great and the show has a perfectly balanced pace so that it never loses the grip of your attention. I can not wait for the start of the seventh season scheduled for October this year.8/10']
