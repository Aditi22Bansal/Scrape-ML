["Jon Hamm is as appealing in this as he is appalling. You may feel stronger with one of those than the other, but while he is the number one character in this, there is a lot more going on here, than might meet the eye. Especially at first, you may not be able to see it. The women are as much part of the whole show as the (Mad) Men. You could even argue that they have a lot more going on at times.The show itself is slow paced though, which may not go down well with some viewers. You really have to be in the mood for the show, for the setting, the time line and all that surrounds it. I know that Jon was hated as much as he was loved by viewers. Because he had so many flaws, but was also intriguing and had that extra special charisma going for him. It's almost impossible to not be enamored by him.Some lingo may not work or may be confusing too, but in the context, you'll never lose sight of things. You don't have to be in the advertising or management business or having lived ages ago. This does work as a bit of a history lesson. And the acting is superb. Of course as with many (recent) shows, it makes sense to have watched all the seasons from the start ... it's character building, even if nuanced"]
