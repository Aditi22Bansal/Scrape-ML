["This is a suspenseful show and it's great.  I saw season 2 then 3 and I am in the middle of season 1.  I think the first season so far is the best. The third is the worst.  The actors are great the the lady who is Neena myers is a hottie.  I hope that there are more seasons to come and I hope that one day, we have a president exactly like David Palmer. Sure, he's African American, but he's the real deal.  There is nobody as good as Palmer and everybody knows it.  Keiffer Sutherland has found his true calling. That is Jack Bower.  Mr. Bower gets in the worst situations and it a lot more tough than even Jack Ryan.  Yes, you heard me right, he is toughger than JACK RYAN!!!Kudos!~"]
