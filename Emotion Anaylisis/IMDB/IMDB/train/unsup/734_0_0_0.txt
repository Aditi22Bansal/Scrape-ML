["Euphoria is a show that's hard to rate, let alone review.It's an experience like no other for all age groups, especially if you're a teen, relating yourself to the characters on one or more stuffs so disturbing to you and one you struggle withIts depiction of issues is graphic, brutal and honest in a good wayIts acting performance is mind-blowing, crystal clear and muddy at the same time in a so talented wayIts storyline and characters developments deep and award worthyIts musical score and soundtracks wonderful, whiplashing and smooth as doves to the ears at the same timeIts cinematography and shooting gorgeous and up to the pointThat's not a series to review with hundreds words, making the feel of it dull and useless in the process.\nYou give your honest, concise opinion and mine is a big positive one.Watch it, live it and be drugged by it.."]
