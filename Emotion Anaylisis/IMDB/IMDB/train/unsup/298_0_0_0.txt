["I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story."]
