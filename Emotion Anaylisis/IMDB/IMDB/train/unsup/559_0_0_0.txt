["How the hell does this show gets an 8.6 rating on IMDb? Am i completely missing the point or what? Without bragging about myself I'm normally known by my friends to have a great sense of humor but this series is just so dumb with almost nothing humorous in it. The characters are so lame and they are actually not even good actors. Almost every character in this series is annoying. You kind of feel the urge to slap them in the face after every line they speak. And the most horrible part of the show is the laugh track. After every single phrase they speak you are apparently obliged to laugh. Well I only laugh or smile when it's funny, I never do on command. And in this show I hardly never laugh because it's just not funny at all. This show is an insult to other comedies."]
