["Thirty years after the events of the first movie in 1982, there is a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), under pressure to complete an important assignment. K manages to find a long buried secret that can plunge the current remaining society into total chaos. Officer K's discovery tends to be just part of a major quest to find a former LAPD blade runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) , who appears to be in self-imposed exile for the last thirty years. Stunning to look at, but at times tedious. Holding things together is a soundtrack featuring Hans Zimmer & Benjiman Wallfisch, Lauren Daigle, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Dennis Villeneuve directs a cast led by: Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Dave Bautista, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks, Edward James Olmos, David Dastmalchian and Sean Young."]
