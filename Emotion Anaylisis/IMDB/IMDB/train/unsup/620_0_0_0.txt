The park is maintained by robotic 'hosts', who aid the fulfilment of the guests desires. However, the many advances in technology that have taken place since the park opened have meant the hosts have become increasingly lifelike over the years.Now, they've reached a point where they are growing more and more self-aware and have a stronger grasp on reality, that reality being that they are simply there to carry out a function. After this long, it would appear that the hosts have had enough, and the ultimate rebellion starts to get underway.Westworld is that other kind of sci-fi, the type that is focused on using technology and the future world to explore who we are as people. The series is about what it means to be sentient. It's about the choices we make. It's even about religion and, increasingly as it goes on, a series about playing god. 9/10THESEVIOLENTDELIGHTSHAVEVIOLENTENDS\n9/10"]
