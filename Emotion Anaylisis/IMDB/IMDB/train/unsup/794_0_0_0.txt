['I am long over anthropomorphised animal people and watching their lives on candid camera.The situations and premise just seem rehashed from numerous older shows, and the shows pacing just seems forced to either make people deal with something they didnt need to in an unamusing way, or just waste time with blow hard tactics aimed at making people feel empathy with the characters. BUT IT DOESNT WORK!\nI just felt nothing withthe show, and after watching episodes 1-5 with some friends baout 4 years ago, I never went back. At least the shows finally over, so that something good might fill the airways ( fat chance, entertainment in most forms has been dead for years lol) . Oh well. 5/10 show at best.']
