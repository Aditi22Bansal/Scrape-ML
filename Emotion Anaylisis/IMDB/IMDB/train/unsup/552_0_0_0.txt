["Modern Family hit the ground running as a unique, sharp and witty show. It didn't have the standard laugh track and got the audience to react to what they thought was funny. The unique and modern characters and their interactions made for some good laughs here and there. Despite its decent start the show proved it was not sustainable and fallen off the radar over the years. It is not what it used to be and sometimes tries too hard. It has gotten to the stage in its life cycle where only its devoted fan base tune in."]
