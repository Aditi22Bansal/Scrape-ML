["..they really had it going most of the way pretty good in the pilot episode. There were several sub-plots pushing the believably boundaries, but for the most part they didn't cross-over... and acting overall was solid. Then it came to the first episode ending, and they really didn't do themselves any favors at all (and it really wasn't necessary). Now they've got to work at getting the thinking audience back on track. With that blunder, they dropped a rating notch or two, for it opens the door to a possibility of more of the same, and that could send a good portion of the audience off to the exits. Time will tell, fortunately we don't have to wait long."]
