["Note: I have seen seasons 1 & 2.You can be most closely related to the TV show Dexter. Both shows really take the time to explore the psychology behind a psychopath's actions. You's dialogue flawlessly manages to present Joe's delusions in a way where the viewer can see both why he believes he is correct and how flawed his delusions really are. Getting the audience to simultaneously feel sympathy and disgust for a character is extremely difficult, yet You was able to do it exceptionally well.However similar the lead characters may be, Dexter is ultimately a crime show while You is a more realistic horror. Each moment in You gives strong vibes that this could really happen in the real world, which makes the viewer feel even more unsettled. Although just as reality is mostly uninteresting, You can also occasionally present conversations and events normally seen in a standard drama that aren't entirely interesting. Those down times aren't too numerous though, so the show remains quite enjoyable throughout.Season 1 - Excellently written to explain how bad people can justify their actions. 7/10Season 2 - Still very interesting, but it tries to make Joe more relatable, which ends up losing part of the first season's essence. Also the conclusion turns into a badly written soap opera, though it does give 3 of the main characters the chance to give some powerful performances. 5/10"]
