["It is really hard to find something bad to say about this brilliant movie. David Fincher directs Aaron Sorkin's screenplay about the skyrocket status of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg)to Internet superstar. Of course when things are accomplished resulting in more money than anyone really needs; friends can easily become enemies. Zuckerberg juggles business relationships with co-founder and money man Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield)and Napster founder Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake). This Harvard undergrad and computer programing wiz just wanted to find female friendship and ended up creating a social network that would eventually end up putting more than a million people in touch with like minded others half way around the world. The ownership of Facebook would end up in question when the Winklevoss twins(Armie Hammer and Josh Pence)put up a bitter courtroom fight for control of the network claiming the young entrepreneur stole their original idea while building it for them. This biographic chronicle deserves every bit of the kudos from the Golden Globes and Oscars. And it seems to employ the cast of millions...well you know what we mean. Garnering screen time are the likes of: Rooney Mara, Joseph Mazzello, Brenda Song, Malese Jow, Bryan Barter, Patrick Mapel, Jayk Gallagher, Mariah Bonner and even writer Sorkin. Interesting way to spend a couple of hours that seem to fly by."]
