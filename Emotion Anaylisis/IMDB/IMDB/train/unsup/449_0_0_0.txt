["For awhile The Walking Dead was one of my favorite shows until season 7 and 8 as of recently I got back to it and forgot how enjoyable it is a lot of the time. The series has some of the most exciting, emotional, and devastating bits that are kinda necessary more than most shows ever! The cast is excellent, writing has ups/ downs, even a fair amount of comedy, so much of it all I love! It's weird the way the direction plays out throughout the coarse of the series kinda like Supernatural was for me I'll be happy when it's over. I'm sorry about my review the show has gone down hill and wanted to be honest about it."]
