['I think that we all know the "Indiana Jones" movies by now. As the main character, Harrison Ford creates a hero to whom we can all relate: tough, but not without his weaknesses. In "Raiders of the Lost Ark", Indy is trying to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on the Ark of the Covenant. And there\'s a plethora of action along the way.Admittedly, the "Indiana Jones" movies had a problem, in that their characters were totally one-dimensional (except for the fact that Indy fears snakes). But this movie isn\'t a character study, people! It\'s pure, unadulterated fun! With great support from Karen Allen (as hubby Marion Ravenwood), Denholm Elliott (as dotty Marcus Brody), and Paul Freeman (as bad guy Rene Belloq), this movie epitomizes the word "cool".']
