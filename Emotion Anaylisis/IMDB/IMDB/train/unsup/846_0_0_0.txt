["Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) is reassigned to his home town of Harlan County, eastern Kentucky and forced to confront his criminal father. Ava Crowder (Joelle Carter) killed her abusive husband. Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) is in the local criminal element. Raylan has a past with them all including coal mining with Boyd.This show is based on Elmore Leonard's story and developed by Graham Yost. The hallmark of this show is its great characters. Olyphant is good. Joelle Carter has both the femme fatale and the damsel in distress. She plays both extremely well. Walton Goggins is the show's guiding light. Other outstanding performances include Margo Martindale, Jeremy Davies and Damon Herriman. The dialog has a sharp fun style and the show never really has a letdown season over the years."]
