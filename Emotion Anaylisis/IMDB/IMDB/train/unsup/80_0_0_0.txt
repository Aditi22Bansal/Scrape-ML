['I\'d never heard of Frank Abagnale Jr before "Catch Me If You Can" came out, but what a guy! Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio\'s cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the \'60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn\'t Steven Spielberg\'s best movie by any stretch, but it\'s sure a neat one. There is one scene that\'s probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Cool.']
