["Really the show was best with Steve Carell at the helm. As he played Michael Scott, a not too bright but still meant well boss. With a mockmentary of what happens at a business in the what else...office! With a bunch and assortment of characters. As Carell despite being the focus and center of attention. Does his best to hold it together as Michael Scott. But it far, far too often fails.Really Carell's nervous boss while trying to keep it together is what made the show great. And it is really missed. John Krasinki is great as Jim the perfect straight man to Carell's Michael Scott. With others like Rain Wilson, BJ Novak, among the others supporting players to back them up.No offense to James Spader who took over for Carell as he is now pursuing a film career. But the show belonged to Carell. As he is really missed!"]
