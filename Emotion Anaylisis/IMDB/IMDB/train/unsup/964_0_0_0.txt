['/refers to Seasons 1 & 2/Together with Scandinavian (particularly Danish and Swedish) crime series, British ones are a sign of quality as well, I have not come across with any that is really annoying. True, their pace is slower and they can well do without constant shootings and chases, so there is a lot of focus on human psychology-relations-background.Still, it is always good when there is a novel depiction mode or interesting intertwining - as we can see in Broadchurch, where it seemed after Season 1 that Season 2 should be based on a) totally new case b) events followed by an escape of the suspect. But the witty combination of and references to an unsolved earlier case make Season 2 even more gripping and versatile. Apart from skillful direction and camera-work, there are also very good and realistic performances (no one chosen by just a "cute" looks and no one sticking unnecessarily out due to his/her fame), and wonderful beach and sea views forming a complex entirety and creating an atmosphere so becoming for such a series. Thus, another good viewer experience, recommended to all those not regarding human and family matters as spoilers on the way of thrill. But one should watch all episodes in succession and definitely begin with Season 1.PS Season 3 is another thrilling creation, with versatile references to Season 2 and distinct solution of the crime.']
