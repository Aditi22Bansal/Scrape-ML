['This cartoon series has a very outrageous style of humour that can put some people off, especially the very offensive character Cartman. Yet it is often done in the service of satire that mostly hits the mark. The plots are also very outrageous though I think they ran out of original ideas as the years went on and just started to parody themselves and popular culture like Family Guy.']
