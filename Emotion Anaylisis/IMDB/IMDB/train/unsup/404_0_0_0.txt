['Pixar became a household name in 1995 with "Toy Story", about cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his rival, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who have to rely on each other\'s abilities and intuition to survive a snafu.I guess that this wasn\'t a masterpiece in the general sense of the word, but it\'s impressive nonetheless (who would have guessed that Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn would ever do voices in a cartoon?). And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: "Monsters, Inc." and "Finding Nemo".I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head\'s lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser). But other than that, there\'s nothing objectionable here. Very interesting.']
