['Five seasons in, "BoJack Horseman" continues to be one of the most complex, thought-provoking and funny animated shows.Season five revolves around BoJack\'s (Will Arnett) new crime show "Philbert", and blossoming relationship with co-star Gina ("Brooklyn Nine-Nine\'s" Stephanie Beatriz). Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) juggles a busy producing career and the prospect of becoming a new mother, there\'s the fallout from Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter\'s divorce, and Todd (the always amazing Aaron Paul) somehow becomes CEO of a big corporation - before being superseded by his home-made sex robot Henry Fondle (whose pre-programmed phrases provides the answers that his employees want). In an often heavy show, Todd\'s levity and crazy hijinks provide vital balance as well as the clever sight gags that\'s become a tradition.The highlight of season five is \'Free Churro\'; it\'s a 25-minute monologue by BoJack at his mother\'s funeral. In these 25 minutes, BoJack\'s complex relationship with his mother unravels, from her final words to him and the random act of kindness to BoJack from a fast food employee. Watching one person talk for 25 minutes flies against the short attention span of most viewers, but it works and Arnett should get some sort of award for it.\nWhile season five continues to expose BoJack\'s many flaws (and constant self-loathing), it ends on an optimistic note, thanks to some help from Diane.A must-watch for BoJack fans.']
