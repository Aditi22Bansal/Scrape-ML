["Let's face it, the Simpsons popularity has grown over the last twenty years ever since it made it's debut on the Tracey Ullman Show. Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson. Being an animated show has it's advantages though, gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices. The show works because of the powers behind the show's success. Maggie is still a baby, Bart is still a brat, and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart. The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself. In live sitcoms, the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another. There are episodes that are good and plentiful. They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe. I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more. They'll be happy to comply."]
