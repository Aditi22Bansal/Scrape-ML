['Nerdy kid, for no real reason buys a wet suit and becomes a "superhero". Along the way he clashes with the mob, their mole hero Red Mist and a little girl and her father who are also "superheroes".I\'m under whelmed by this tale of teen angst turned toward acceptable violence. Sure its grand wish fulfillment for anyone who wanted to be Spiderman and Batman, but at the same time it seems like it was constructed by the same people looking for said fulfillment. Its the story of a geeky kid who get to beat people up, gets the girl and live happily ever after. The problem it has a story that not only has plot holes you could drive a truck through, but it shifts tones almost moment by moment. Is it serious? is it a joke? What exactly am I suppose to feel? I don\'t know. I know some people have called it morally bankrupt and I can kind of see where thats coming from, with the tone being uncertain you don\'t know where the film stands.I\'m not going to say much more other than to say I was extremely disappointed. Neither bad nor good, its kind of half baked.I\'d wait for cable.']
