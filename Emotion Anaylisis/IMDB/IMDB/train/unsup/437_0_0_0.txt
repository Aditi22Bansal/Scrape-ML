['I thought that "Kick Ass" was going to be more of a comedy that would leave you laughing your ass off.The story is pretty good, and have lots of interesting characters in it. Both main characters and supporting ones have been given good detail in being fleshed out on the screen.Now what surprised me the most was seeing Nicholas Cage in that role. I am not much of a fan of him, truth be told, but this time he was actually cool to look at. Especially the scene where he is toughening up the girl for a gunshot experience. I was laughing so hard at that scene.As for the effects and stuff, well they were nice. Lots of cool things going on in the movie.Another great \'superhero\' movie without super powers. Although "Kick Ass" is cool, it just doesn\'t reach "Defendor" to the knees. But I don\'t think "Kick Ass" will leave you disappointed though.Lots of nice action and a good, steady flow to the story, so you are never left bored. And the scenes with Hit Girl in action, wow! That was amazing, a young girl like that doing those kinds of scenes, that was awesome. Actually, I was surprised at the amount of action and blood in the movie."Kick Ass" have something for everyone, so you should check out this movie. If you like this one, you might want to turn your attention to "Defendor" as well.']
