['I only watched seasons 1 and 2. The concept of time travel heroism was fun. The acting is hit and miss and stories were fun to watch. Characters were ll unqiue and indifferent. However, after indulging most of my energy into the father of superhero TV shows "Arrow", then having to keep up with the Flash as well as keeping up with the MCU. I became superhero fatigued to sit through another 20-24 episodes of tedious drama that really goes nowhere in terms of my own productivity. LOT is a fun show its just the overwhelming of superhero shows and having to sit through 20-24 episodes is why I stopped watching. Still, once again it was a good series when I was watching.Last Words: Arrow verse was a fun universe. I remember finding Arrow by accident, that one night, and here I am.']
