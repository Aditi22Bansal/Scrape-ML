["Definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. I don't think I ever saw a better one. At least I can't remember a better one. I write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. That's says it all. The acting is excellent. There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. And don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. Never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything. I'm a devoted fan, so devoted I already have three tattoos about it. House Targayen rules!"]
