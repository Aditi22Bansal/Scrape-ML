["For me District 9 is neither a masterpiece or a bad movie, instead it is an interesting but not entirely successful kind of movie.For a low budget movie, District 9 does look excellent. The cinematography, editing and effects are very, very good, and I did accept the aliens appearance wise. The soundtrack and sound also create a sense of foreboding and genuine atmosphere, the concept is amazing and the film does start off brilliantly. The acting overall by a largely unknown cast is good, as is the direction, and the lead characters are likable.What didn't impress me so much, is that while District 9 does have heart, that I could see from how it was made and the enthusiasm of the actors and director, I wasn't entirely involved. As I've said, the film starts off with no problem, but the final third with plot points that were either rushed and underdeveloped or silly or clich√©d wasn't so good. The story doesn't quite live up to the concept for me, it was intriguing and thoughtfully handled but thin, the support characters aren't as well-thought out or as likable as the leads, the dialogue has some sketchiness that is particularly evident in the slower parts and final third and the pace does get sluggish sometimes.Overall, I did like it and was intrigued by it, but sorry it isn't a movie I would see again in a hurry. 6/10 Bethany Cox"]
