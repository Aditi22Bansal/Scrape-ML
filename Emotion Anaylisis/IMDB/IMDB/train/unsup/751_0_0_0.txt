['The show has a different atmosphere, darker and more intense than most of the superhero shows. While "Supergirl", "Smallville", "Flash" and such reminds me of teenage shows from 90\'s, Daredevil and Jessica Jones are more serious and more movie-like. What I like the most is that the show is based on a good story and not only on superpowers and special effects.7,5/10I just finished the second season and although show now has a faster pace and it\'s more interesting, it lacks persuasiveness. Electra and Punisher are a welcome refreshment, but still, I cannot give it more than strong 7.7/10']
