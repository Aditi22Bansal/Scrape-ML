["Well this was beautifully done. The sets, the cast, the imagery. They could have done with a little less , I can't believe I am saying this , but visually it was a lot to take in - i am so visually appreciative when it comes to shows and how do I say - this was stunning (but for me) too gratuitously so. It pushed the bounds of my comfort level. I have to give it the solid 8 I liked the characters, became enmeshed in their plights the story was a good one , the filler was the best ever really but somehow I felt there was money and talent to create these over the top montage type (Isn't the word but like that) scenes) i I give it a solid 8, pardon the pun it was well done but I had trouble suggesting it. Not at all because of the political it whatever you call it tendencies if characters etc that was reasonable and I liked the representation of the many cultures and people , it was elaborate in that way. I mean what more could I want ? It had everything!"]
