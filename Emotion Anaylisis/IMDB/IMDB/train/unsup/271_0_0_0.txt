['This film tells the story of two bounty hunters, a sheriff and a wanted woman who seek refuge from a harsh snowy winter in a haberdashery. They soon find out that their new companions are not to be trusted, and soon violence ensues."The Hateful Eight" is a mystery set in a Western setting, and has a plot that is complicated but still can be followed. The pace is slow at times, but it helps to deliver the various twists and turns of the plot clearly. I also liked the fact that characters think aloud at times to explain the plot. As usual, the violence and gore is very graphic, to the point that it is over the top funny. Though "The Hateful Eight" did not keep me on edge or made me hold my breath, I did not feel that it was three hours long.']
