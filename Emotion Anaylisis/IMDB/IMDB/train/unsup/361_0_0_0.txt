["When my movie theatre-working friend suggested seeing a film yesterday, this was the only one currently out that neither of us had seen yet that I wanted to watch. And both of us were very glad for the choice! I mean, you wouldn't think a romantic comedy-drama about two emotionally or mentally depressed people possibly falling in love would hold much appeal but it did for me and my friend. And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence. Also so glad Ms. Lawrence got her Golden Globe and if she wins her Academy Award, I'll be even more happy! Really, despite all the messy emotions that are explored here or maybe because of all that, I really enjoyed and highly recommend Silver Linings Playbook!"]
