['It looks to me, based upon some reviews here, that many viewers gave up on this show within the first few episodes, before it had even begun to demonstrate the basics of the show\'s story."The 100" begins with a remnant of Earth society, orbiting Earth years after an apocalyptic event. Due to circumstances, 100 of them--teens and young adults--are sent to an unknown fate on Earth\'s surface, where they set up an elementary society and try to survive in dangerous environs."Grounders" are living on the surface, as are at least two other societies of people. The plot hits its stride when the remaining satellite people also descend to the surface. So many posters complain about "absurd" plot points, some of which are incorrect or irrelevant. I assume these reviewers refused to watch "Star Trek" because of absurd story lines and scientific improbabilities. That is their prerogative. But those who can suspend some disbelief will find a complex story about social order and the nature of man. There are some very good actors involved. The visuals are rich. And the cast expands as the characters meet and become familiar with others. I might add, without giving away any spoilers, that the "new world" of this unfamiliar Earth offers many surprises and a few unexpected secrets.Update 12/16/14: This series has proved that it is on the right track. The plot lines are engaging and the characters are well-defined. I am upgrading my vote to "8".']
