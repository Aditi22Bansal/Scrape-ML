['Television meet Twilight! "The Vampire Diaries" is Vampires meets a soap opera. I have watched a full 15 minutes of the show, and other bits and pieces here and there of "The Vampire Diaries", while my wife is glued to the show. Here are my deductions of "The Vampire Diaries" First deductions everyone is hot or good looking on the show. Too much eye candy! Second the Twilight recurring theme of rival vampires, witches, and who is going be turned into a vampire reminds me of some sort of high school click. Romance/drama forbidden love. One girl has the hots for the other\'s boyfriend. The show has the usual soap opera sub plots back stabbing, infighting, lies, secrets. I miss the entertainment value of the show but my wife loves it. I give the show a 2 and my wife give it a 9/10.']
