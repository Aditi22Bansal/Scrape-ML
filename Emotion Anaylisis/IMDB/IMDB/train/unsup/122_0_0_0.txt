["I saw the very first Spider Man entry with Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and whilst I enjoyed it I wasn't so enamored to watch any others until this current release which attracted excellent reviews. From minute one it was obvious that a lot had gone on in those other Spider Mans because it was barely the same Peter Parker/Spider-Man I met all those years ago. For one thing a lot is made of an outfit called The Avengers, which seems to be a group of superheroes bent on saving the planet and of which Spider-Man is a member. Then he has a 'mentor' in the shape of Robert Downey jnr, a 'special' friend best described as a nerd and has a crush on a Black schoolmate, so much for the Kirsten Dunst character. It seems evident that the last two or three Spider-Man movies are not so much stand-alones as sequential so I can only comment on this entry as something I only partly 'got'. Having said that it was reasonably entertaining if not (to me) as compelling as the original."]
