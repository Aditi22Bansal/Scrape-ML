["If you enjoy naked, sweaty men grappling each other, this is for you. Full frontal nudity: Crixus standing there while a patrician Roman woman inspected his goods was a little too much. Shaved pubic hair and the black skin of his penis is a sure indicator of steroid abuse. We have characters alternately speaking like Shakespeare and then hurling obscenities as if they were on an inner city bus after the local ghetto school was let out. Soft core porn of men doing women, men doing men, and women doing women and you pretty much see what this is really about. Extremely phony fight scenes where gladiators fight on after losing 40% of their blood... This has nothing to do with Spartacus - it's just a revolting exploitation vehicle. I stopped watching it. What's up with the signature scene, appearing in each episode, where a gladiator gets whacked in the face, his head spins around, and a pint of blood splashes out of his mouth? Then he always continues as if nothing had happened, without so much as a swollen lip."]
