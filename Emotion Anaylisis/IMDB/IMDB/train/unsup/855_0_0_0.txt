['I\'m amazed at the ratings associated with this show. To my mind its title pretty much sums it up, The Leftovers. Its a rather uninspiring mish mash of a range of well worn ideas, reminiscent of shows like Lost, Legion, The 4400 and others where something is "amiss". People either appear or in this case disappear without obvious cause. Is it Angels, ET\'s? I\'d be inclined to say "who cares". After two tedious episodes where nothing really happens aside from an odd ball cult who all dress like 1950\'s milkmen/asylum orderlies with a smoking habit and a vow of silence I\'d had enough. The rest is horribly formulaic too, the cop with a predictable drinking problem, wife and daughter issues, son hanging around with yet another cult. You get the idea. The acting is alright but there were no stand out performance\'s on offer that I could see either. Not surprising as this show provided me with scant inspiration. Five out of ten.']
