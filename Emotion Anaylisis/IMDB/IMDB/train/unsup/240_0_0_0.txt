["If it is depicted as it is in this movie, anyway. A movie, that makes you fall in love with Rachel McAdams (or maybe her male counterpart, depending on your orientation), a movie that actually convinces in it's romantic roots, which sadly can't be said about many movies. Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)"]
