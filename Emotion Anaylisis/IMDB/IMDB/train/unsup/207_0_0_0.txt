["Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!"]
