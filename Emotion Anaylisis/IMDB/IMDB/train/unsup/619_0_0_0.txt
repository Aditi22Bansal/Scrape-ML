["Not a bad show. There are highs and lows. Decent writing. Decent directing. Some scenes are outstanding. Suspense and originality make a for a good combination. Character progression is smooth and stable, but there are sometimes when I get bored and want to skip forward. Cool cinematography, special effects and an effort to make things realistic add to the quality of the production. It's not perfect. It has flaws which are obvious. However all the good things I like about the show carry it forward. I like the mix of the politics and multiple story arcs. It also has great season finales because they are cliff hangers, leaving you wanting more."]
