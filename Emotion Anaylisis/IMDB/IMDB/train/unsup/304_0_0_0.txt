['For a big-time diamond heist, aging mobster Lawrence Tierney (as Joe Cabot) and gun-loving son Chris Penn (as Eddie "Nice Guy" Cabot) assemble a perfect group of six-shooters - veteran Harvey Keitel (as Larry "Mr. White" Dimmick), bloody Tim Roth (as Freddy "Mr. Orange" Newandyke), sadistic Michael Madsen (as Vic "Mr. Blonde" Vega), neurotic Steve Buscemi (as "Mr. Pink"), grizzled Edward "Eddie" Bunker (as "Mr. Blue"), and director Quentin Tarantino (as "Mr. Brown"). When one of them tips off the cops, the perfect crime becomes a ruthless and revenge-laden river of blood..."Critically acclaimed for its raw power and breathtaking ferocity," as accurately described on the Special Edition re-release, this is "the brilliant American gangster movie classic from writer-director Quentin Tarantino." This film STILL blows away the competition; with a dreamily dedicated cast and crew, Mr. Tarantino tapped several generations of kinetic crime energy, and exploded it into the 1990s. Since so much will already have been written, applause to those who (hopefully) noticed how Tarantino knew precisely when to turn the lens away from his most gruesome moment of torture - thus intensifying your repulsion. He\'s a natural. Now, since Tarantino soon took to carrying Barnabas Collins\' cane from "Dark Shadows" to talk shows and photo shoots, did he know Harvey Keitel was once a Blue Whale barfly? ********** Reservoir Dogs (1/21/92) Quentin Tarantino ~ Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen']
