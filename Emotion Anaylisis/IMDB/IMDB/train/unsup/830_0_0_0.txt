['This show was simply one of the best comedies that I\'ve seen . Form the first episode I was fascinated for the story ,the character and their (utterly hilarious ) conflicts . Using a visual technique that reminds me very much Dogma 95 Movies , "Arrested Development " it\'s pure fun from beginning to end . I tried to find a single moment that wasn\'t funny ,but I couldn\'t .All the gags , verbal , physical or of any other kind were incredibly effective . It\'s so sad that it was canceled ! But even that ,I\'m glad that I\'ve the luck to see all the episodes . I\'m sure that this show will we remembered as a classic in the future years . Oustanding !']
