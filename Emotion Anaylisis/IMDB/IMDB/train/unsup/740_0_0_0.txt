["The series, which runs for 10 episodes, is not an origin story although origins are important. The members of The Umbrella Academy are all grown up now, after a childhood spent in the limelight. One day in 1989, 43 babies were born to mothers who were not pregnant the day before. Seven of them were purchased by an eccentric billionaire, Sir Reginald Hargreeves , who trained them up as The Umbrella Academy to be crime fighters - and perhaps something more.There are a lot of characters presented all at once, but one of the The Umbrella Academy's many strengths is that it understands the importance of a good montage. Those, augmented by a killer soundtrack, help make everyone stand out and immediately recognizable.The Umbrella Academy is quick, quirky, and light, although there are real stakes and consequences that play out over the course of the season.It's frankly difficult to think back to how everything began in this crazy show after having buzzed through its 10 episodes, because it's so full of layered narratives. Don't look up spoilers, though - knowing less is more. Not having read the books, I can't speak to the Netflix series' success as an adaptation. But as a superhero-tinged TV show, it gets everything right. The Umbrella Academy is incredibly interesting, enjoyable, quirky, and well worth your time."]
