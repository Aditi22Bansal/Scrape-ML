['Muscular genius Matt Damon (as Will Hunting) works as a janitor at Boston\'s M.I.T. (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); but, he\'s smarter than the professors teaching there, like Stellan Skarsgard (as Gerald Lambeau). When nobody\'s looking, Mr. Damon solves complex mathematic problems on Mr. Skarsgard\'s chalkboard. At night, he goes out carousing with Ben Affleck (as Chuckie Sullivan), a likewise handsome drinking buddy. Mr. Affleck wants best friend Damon to use his head for more than a hat-rack.Abused as a orphan, Damon likes to take his pals out to beat guys up, as a chaser. Eventually, this socio-emotional behavior lands Damon in jail. Professor Skarsgard, who has discovered Damon\'s a fellow intellect, sets him up on probation, with psychologist Robin Williams (as Sean Maguire). Mr. Williams asks Damon if he has a "soul mate". Damon is dating pre-med Minnie Driver (as Skylar), but has trouble committing. Can Ms. Driver, Affleck, Skarsgard, and Williams save Damon from a lifetime of janitorial eloquence? A bit snobbish, but with good reason.******** Good Will Hunting (12/2/97) Gus Van Sant ~ Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Robin Williams, Minnie Driver']
