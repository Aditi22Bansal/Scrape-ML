['What a cracking series. Super violent, heroic, and honorable. In the vein of Old Boy and other great Asian crime flicks. Honestly one of the few Hollywood attempts that can match the best Chinese, Japanese and Korean products.Rollicking great fun and yet, amidst all the over the top violence, gore and general mayhem, the creators have still managed to piece together a strong storyline, compelling characters and perhaps even an empathy with the baddies.Definitely not to be missed if you like the Hong Kong crime and gang genre.']
