["The mysterious disappearance of 2% of the world's population has not been answered or solved seven years later. As the anniversary approaches, the characters that survived are worried that something will happen. Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) is still struggling with his experience dying and coming back to life. Nora Durst (Carrie Coon) misses her family who disappeared on that day and learns of a way to encounter them again. Laurie Garvey (Amy Brenneman) has married John Murphy (Kevin Carroll) and they run a scamming business where they pretend to speak to the dead. Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston) is writing a book about Kevin and all the miracles that he has seen in Mapleton and Jarden. The third and final season moves the characters to Australia where Kevin's father Kevin Garvey Sr. (Scott Glenn) believes that a great flood is coming on the 7 year anniversary and he has to find a song to stop it. Nora's search for her missing children also brings her to Australia where she believes a mysterious group has a device that shoots a person with radiation and sends them to where everyone else went. Kevin has taken to putting a bag over his head and thinks a trip to Australia will help him get away from whatever he fears.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"]
