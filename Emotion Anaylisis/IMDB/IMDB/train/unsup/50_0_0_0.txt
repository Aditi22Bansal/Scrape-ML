['"With the help of a courageous fellowship of friends and allies, Frodo embarks on a perilous mission to destroy the legendary \'One Ring\'. Hunting Frodo are servants of the Dark Lord Sauron, the Ring\'s evil creator. If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed," according to the DVD sleeve description, "Winner of four \'Academy Awards\', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination." Reading the original J.R.R. Tolkien novels was an intellectual rite of passage; whilst young, you read and enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy willingly - prepping with "The Hobbit", of course. "It\'s a job that\'s never started that takes the longest to finish," someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson\'s "The Fellowship of the Ring" is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it\'s made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness."The Bridge of Khazad-DÃ»m" (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable "Lord of the Rings" reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable. Mr. Jackson and company recreate some emotional scenes extraordinarily well. At one time, it seemed impossible to think that such literature could be brought to cinematic form.******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom']
