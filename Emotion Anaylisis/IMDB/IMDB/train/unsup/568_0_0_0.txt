["The WitcherI loved it!In many way this series was a bit of a mess, the box set skipped around, half the time we had no clue what this or that meant, and the whole thing lacked cohesiveness, whether this was entirely intentional I would think not. However by the end of the series we were less confused and there were some elements that created better connection. In summation this was not easy viewing.Whoever did the casting was inspired, we had in the main seasoned pros, this well upped the whole series. Henry Cavill was perfect for the role and a master of the aside, the deadpan humour and a good deal of comic timing.There were so many good things here we were spoilt, it does need to raise itself before it becomes mired in teenage angst or to many special effects, it is the strength of story and dramatic impetus that will make this show stand out.If someone is truly evil make them so no half measures.I just can't wait for series 2, I want it now......!"]
