["DEADWOOD became quite overlooked at both the Emmy and Golden Globe awards, though it saw Ian McShanan anchoring his Al Swearengen an Golden Globe statue this series should proudly have strutted more awards after its three years run. You won't find a better TV-drama than this, surely we've seen Sopranos-commercial success and Six Feet Under's bizarre and highly original pull-offs, but Deadwood has an edge and guts that's truly, truly remarkable - the character performances for one thing is gold, Swearengen (the leading gusto) is nothing but stunning, his barbarous methods may be devil-sent, but his vision is even stronger as he staves off chaos controlling Deadwood. And although like other HBO-series say Sopranos or even more promptly, the Wire, the show is a slow-burning affair, the episodes are languorosly as they talk and talk, discuss, push & pull - but the narrative moves are so perfectly placed that it doesn't get boring for a single second. All of the Deadwood-citizens are making way for politics, education and culture, law & order doesn't steer Deadwood with its firm hand - Deadwood itself does, anarchy in a western-civilization in which everyone avoids chaos, but chaos is inevitable. Throughout its three seasons we see the Gold Rush Dakota-setting going from its giddy to its change of time, the Great West changing course. You faint of heart, cover your ears and shut your eyes - live fast, die young - Deadwood's in town."]
