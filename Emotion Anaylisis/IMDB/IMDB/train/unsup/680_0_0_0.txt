['I have watched every episode of "New Girl", but sometimes I consider stopping. Why? Because this show take quirkiness beyond what is funny sometimes. The writers of this show apparently think that silly = funny. Sometimes it does, but if characters\' actions and words seem to have no purpose than to be weird, the humor loses its edge.I compare this to "Suburgatory" which is also a quirky show, but it retains its edge through clever writing that includes insight, parody, and critique.I love the cast of "New Girl". I have always been a fan of Zooey Deschanel. Hannah Simone is beautiful and talented. Actually, all of the leads have talent. I just wish they were given roles that allowed them to say clever things, i.e. perceptive things, sometimes. Most of the dialogue is just silliness.']
