["Firefly has a huge cult following, and I can see why. Had it been allowed to grow and develop, it could have turned into a fantastic series the way Buffy did (whih actually had a much weaker first season than this). As it is though, it's just really good, although it does hit greatness various instances. The characters are pretty fantastic and episodes in you really feel a sense of family, something Whedon has always been great at doing. It also helps that the cast is up to par, there's no weak link to be found and makes ranking them that much harder. I still have yet to see the film but I hope it doesn't disappoint, and I hope Netflix does something to bring this back."]
