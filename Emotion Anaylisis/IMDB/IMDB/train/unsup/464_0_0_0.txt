["I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother. Anyway, it has become Ally McBeal meets ER now rather than St. Elsewhere."]
