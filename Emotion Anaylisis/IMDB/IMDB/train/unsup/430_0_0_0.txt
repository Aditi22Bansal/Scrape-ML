['We all know that in sequels, they take everything one step further, and you\'d better believe that "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest" does that! With Johnny Depp continuing his Keith Richards-style buccaneer Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom resurrecting Will Turner, and Keira Knightley resurrecting Elizabeth Swann, how can you go wrong (especially since this sequel is grittier than the original)? Obviously, there\'s plenty of swashbuckling and CGI, but it\'s Depp\'s characterizations that carry the movie. Whether it\'s battles with Davy Jones and his crew, or an unpleasant encounter with the Kraken, this movie has something for everyone. Really cool.Also starring Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and Stellan Skarsgard. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!']
