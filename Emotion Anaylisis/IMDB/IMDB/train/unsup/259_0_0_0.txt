['T1 (if the sequel is called T2, than it\'s logical to call it that, no?) is now 21 years old. Even in America it\'s allowed to do anything in any state. Then again with the president they have at the moment anything is possible anyway. But back to this, which is as raw, tough and mental as you may remember it.I still haven\'t read the book this is based on, but the movie really lives up to the hype. If you haven\'t seen it yet, I reckon a double bill with the sequel is about to happen. It\'s actually something you should treat yourself with. And I\'m saying this a day before going into the second movie, but anticipations could not be much higher. Than again, riffing on "Terminator" with the T2 title shortening is a rather clever marketing plot. It also tells us: we will deliver a great sequel. And I believe they will. Will they be able to shock as they did with a couple of scenes in this one? That will be hard, especially a scene with a baby, the infamous toilet scene and much more is tough to beat ... which makes this such a great movie. A must see, if you don\'t mind anarchic over the top stories. That are aware of their moral obligations, but not preaching too much']
