["I like Bones in spite of the silly and often inaccurate pretensions this criminal investigation drama is built upon. Bones is a low EQ high IQ forensic anthropologist who solves murder mysteries using the assumed power of science. The reality of forensics however is nowhere near as analytic as this show would have you believe. Its an imprecise art more than a science and as such its prone to error. The other limitation, with Bones, is it is inclined to be a bit corny and clinched, at times. This is exacerbated by the shows tendency to make rather shallow, moral judgments, that, like the shows forensics, simply don't stand up too well to scrutiny. Casting these shortcomings aside what makes Bones work for me is the interplay between the main characters. The cast of actors work well together and compliment one another.The relationships that develop between them also give this show a sense of family that is familiar and at times charming. Bones lack of emotional intelligence leads to some genuinely funny moments too. The episodic stories are innovative with enough interesting plot twists and turns to keep the viewers attention. Definitely worth a hour or so of your time (just not over dinner as some of the forensic scenes can be a bit graphic)."]
