['I never liked "Monk" very much. But from the instant this show came on right after it, I knew USA finally had something. This has to be one of the best shows ever made-- if not, then definitely one of the top comedies. It combines dramedy, mystery, the buddy dynamic, and pineapples. It\'s got lots of witty references, from "Airwolf" to "Smokey & the Bandit," and it features two main characters (Shawn, played by James Roday, and Gus, played by Dule Hill) who make a great duo all-around, from their great chemistry to their playful A-B Club ethics. Corbin Bernsen shakes things up as Shawn\'s tough-as-nails ex-cop dad. Kirsten Nelson deserves some sort of Emmy for her take on police chief Karen Vick. And as the anti-Shawn-and-Gus, Timothy Omundson and Maggie Lawson are fantastic (Lawson was a replacement after the pilot episode for the equally phenomenal Anne Dudek, who played a woman named Precious in an episode of "Friends"). This show has it all-- the humor is spot-on, the mysteries just keep improving with age, and I think we\'ll always be drawn to a show about a slacker with a heart of gold... and fake psychic abilities.']
