["Overly violent and constant use of the derogatory term for African-Americans marks this 2012 Quentin Tarrantino film.Christoph Waltz won the best supporting actor award despite the fact that he is in every scene, with the exception of the last 20 minutes of the film. As the house slave totally devoted to his master, a mean, fierce Leonardo De Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson should have been in the supporting category instead.A study of how a bounty hunter gets a slave free to pursue his own agenda of catching three brothers. The brothers are known by slave Jamie Foxx. Foxx is taught how to shoot and conduct himself as a man by Waltz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter. Waltz is high on intelligence and especially uses an effective vocabulary.The two conspire to free Foxx's enslaved wife, who has been separated from him and is under the De Caprio terror.A study of ante-bellum south with their bigotry."]
