['The story has been written a couple of times on here, I won\'t repeat it again ... Pun intended. But aside from that(which kind of redefines "repeated" viewing a bit), the movie is actually pretty good. While the initial pushing into the whole mess story, is a bit stretched, it does work out and make sort of sense.Plus you have two great actors who are game to go all the way. Emily and Tom are a great pair and the chemistry is obvious on screen. Everything they do makes sense and the script really does treat the viewer as if he/she are intelligent human beings. Which is nice for a change (in Hollywood Land). The end (or third act or whatever you want to call it), might seem a bit stretched, especially considering what has been done before, but after all you won\'t mind too much and be just thrilled and enjoy the ride']
