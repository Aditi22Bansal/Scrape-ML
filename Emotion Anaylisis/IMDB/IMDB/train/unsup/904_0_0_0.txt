["A dysfunctional family headed by a loud mouth idiot is nothing new. In fact, it's a dime a dozen nowadays. But for its times, it pushed all the envelopes.Ed O'Neill delivers a big time performance as the loser husband shoe salesman. Katey Sagal creates a chocolate bonbon filled wife. Christina Applegate is the dim-witted blonde daughter. David Faustino is the creepy little brother.The writing is rock-solid. The show kept pushing the censors. The fact that many people opposed it just made it so much better. But it's the actors who created such outlandish characters that deserves the most praise. It lasted a shocking 11 years. The last few were of lower quality stuff, but it still deserves all the love."]
