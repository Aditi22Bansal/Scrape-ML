["For example: In Episode 7, they were blown and ran into underground in a safe house, the young Romeo Hughie still kept calling Annie but got no answer. Hey, you guys didn't know they could trace back the location where you were hiding with your cell phone? And the other guy Frenchie still on his laptop? Jesus, this is the common sense even a guy like me would know when being hunted, the first thing you do is either dump your phone, or turn it off, or take the sim card out and snip it in half or whatever to make you disappear from the cyber space, still used your phone and got on line with your laptop? Jesus.....@#$?!"]
