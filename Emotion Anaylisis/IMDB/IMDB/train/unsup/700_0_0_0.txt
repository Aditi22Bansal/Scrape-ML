['This a great show. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. See it. It got an 8.2. Which is a good rating. But this is such a great show that 8.2 is underrating. I give 10 out of 10. The movie from 1992 is a little bit better. But still this a great show. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. Godzilla (1998) is better. But only by a little bit. Jaws is also better. Still this a great show. It is better then A Nightmare on elm street. And that is not easy to do.']
