["An intriguing mystery, a stonking cast and a poignant performance by Reese Witherspoon look like making Big Little Lies appointment viewing for the next couple of months.With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard on board, the series isn't short of star wattage, but it's Witherspoon's performance as Madeline Mackenzie, a wife and mother who feels cruelly superfluous in her own home, that reels the viewer in in this first episode.The drama takes place in Monterey, California, where Silicon Valley's nouveau riche rub shoulders with the working class as parents of pupils at a particularly desirable public school. Writer David E. Kelley - adapting the novel by Australian Liane Moriarty - and director Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers' Club), quickly establish a tense little world in which quiet desperation cuts across all income brackets.Then a glitzy fundraiser for the school ends in murder."]
