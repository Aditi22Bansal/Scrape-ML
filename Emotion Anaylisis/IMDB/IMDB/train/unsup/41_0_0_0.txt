['It seems escaping any definition. It is pure Tarantino. Or, more precise, one of the most Tarantino films. For the reasons who determs you see again , time by time. For stories and characters and dialogues and memorable scenes. For the music and for high performances. And for the unexpecting turns. And for the illusion to be an ordinary chain of stories. For emotions. And for the manner to tell them. And, sure, for the fascinating magic. And for too many others.']
