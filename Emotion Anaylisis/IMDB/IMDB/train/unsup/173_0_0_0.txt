["SPIRITED AWAY (2002) **** (ANIMATED/JAPANESE Â– DUBBED) (Voices: Daveigh Chase, Suzanne Pleshette, Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, Jason Marsden, John Ratzenberger, David Ogden Steirs.  Fantastic animated fantasy by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki constructs a unique story about a little girl who winds up in an amusement park for the spirit world and must save her parents' fate of being turned into swine all the while encountering odd characters, both benevolent and malevolent.  Awesome set pieces and colorful dreamscapes perpetuate the engrossingly entertaining storyline as it progresses with much humor, dread and sense of utter disbelief at just how magical animation can be.  One of the best of its genre."]
