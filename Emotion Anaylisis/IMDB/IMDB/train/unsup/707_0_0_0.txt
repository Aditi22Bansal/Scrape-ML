["Okay, when this show first started, I actually quite liked it. I found the writing quite funny and creative and I liked some of the interplay between the characters. But over time, Two and a Half Men has become duller and more stale, I feel similarly about How I Met Your Mother too. The production values are good as is Charlie Sheen, the only actor to have any real life in his character, but that's it. The writing and jokes that were once creative are now stale and forced, even lacking in subtlety, while the story lines introduce good themes but don't introduce and explore them well and the stories themselves feel rushed and predictable. The characters are not very likable now, some actually are annoying and act like idiots. Now they've replaced Sheen, while I am overall not impressed with the show, I think regardless of his problems I think replacing him is a mistake, without him the show really is going to be a dead weight even with all the other faults it has. All in all, a decent show when it started, now it is unwatchable and hard to get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox"]
