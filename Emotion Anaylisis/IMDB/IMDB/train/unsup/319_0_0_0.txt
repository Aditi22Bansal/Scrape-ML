['This film is about the lives of the people in the City of God, a place full of violence and lawlessness."City of God" is powerful, partly through the shocking events, and also the effective story telling. There is not a moment of boredom or time filler. The events portrayed in "City of God" are so shocking. Lives are constantly lost due to random fights and shootouts. Lives have no value, and we only see a mourning scene once in the entire film. Towards the end of the film, I feel my spine tingling with fear and shock. I am left in bewilderment as to how people can be so ruthless and merciless. City of God seems to be a place where humanity descends to the lowest level possible. "City of God" leaves me entranced even after the film ended. It\'s really powerful.']
