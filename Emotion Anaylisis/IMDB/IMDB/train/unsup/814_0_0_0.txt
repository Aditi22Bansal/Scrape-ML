['A crime drama about the rise (and falls) of Detective James Gordon in the years while Bruce Wayne grows into Batman, told in parallel from the angle of Gordon himself, from the angle of young Wayne, as well as from the angles of important players of the Gotham underworld.Initially a combination of gangster and buddy-cop genres, as convincing and realistic as possible for the DC universe, the series later grows into an SF superhero (or supervillain, as they are in majority and much more fun) madness with countless plots and subplots. However, although it may be a bit over-the-top, the series does not lose its direction and not a single ark remains incomplete.The complex multi-layered story, which does not get lost in its complexity, brings us the origins stories of Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Catwoman, and many other well-known characters of the Batman universe, and introduces some new, equally good ones. The strongest asset of the series is the great variety of compelling characters with excellent characterization (no black-and-white division between good and evil) and the evolution of their relationships. The cast is top-notch, and I especially have to single out the wicked and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith, the best Penguin ever played by Robin Lord Taylor, Cory Michael Smith as Riddler, and Cameron Monaghan as the Joker whose creepiness is unlikely to ever be matched, let alone exceeded.8/10.']
