["Sex and the City (1998-2004) is one of my absolute favorites for many reasons. First off, it sports an incredible cast! Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, Kim Cattrall plays Samantha Jones, Cynthia Nixon is Miranda Hobbes, and Kristin Davis plays Charlotte York. The casting is spot on, every actress plays their character perfectly. It's true that they're all a joy to watch, Samantha Jones is my personal favorite, she's truly hilarious and just when you think she can't think about anything other than casual sex, she surprises you with her big heart. I love that each character has their own style and they are so different as people, yet they fit together perfectly as a friend group. The writing is just great. It is full of witty, hilarious humor, touching moments between these well developed characters, and it's all pulled together by the great chemistry that hovers over the whole show. Another thing I love is how real the show is, especially about sex. All is revealed. The dialogue is uncensored and that works for the show. Overall, this is a very entertaining, well written show that I definitely suggest! 10/10."]
