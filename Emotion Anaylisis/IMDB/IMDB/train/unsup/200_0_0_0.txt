['After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.']
