['Have just watched the first season of this sci fi show as much as I found it interesting it is a little predictable and along the lines of the X files each episode a different story but with the underlined theory they are all connected to a bigger picture that will unravel as the seasons progress. Not gripping but easy to watch so scores a 6 from me may change if future seasons improve?']
