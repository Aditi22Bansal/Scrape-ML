["Episode 1 is a good film, but it is by no means the best of the series. True, this is technically the first of the series (or the fourth), and it does set a good stage for the other films, but this film does have it's flaws.  1- Jar Jar Binks!  What drug was Lucas on when he created that character.  I haven't seen a character (a comic relief one at that) as bad as that since Godzilla in 98.  And 2- It's not as heart warming as the last ones, the other films seemed to at least have a good sense of love in it. \nYet, that doesn't stop writer/director George Lucas form having plenty of fun (including with spectacular visual effects that make up most of the movie) including a terrific Pod Race sequence, great fight scenes, and cool battle action.  But it does prove one thing, that like episode 4, the episode following it (like the dark episiode 5- The Empire Strikes Back) will be dark and good.  Good entertainment anyway."]
