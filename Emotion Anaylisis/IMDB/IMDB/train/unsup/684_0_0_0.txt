["Killing Eve has been superb viewing from start to finish, credit to the BBC for creating something this good, and thumbs up for putting it on Saturday nights, it follows on from the success they had with Taboo.The story is fantastic, huge credit to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for writing something so clever, so dark, yet so humorous, it really has been a thrilling ride. If I'm totally honest I must say the key factor to the show has been Jodie Comer, she has been utterly sensational, a part she could have easily overplayed, but to her credit she made Villanelle very sincere. Sandra oh, David Haig and Fiona Shaw all utterly brilliant also.The music throughout was fabulous, that song 'I had to kill you,' fitted in perfectly, it all worked so well together.Great production values, it looked awesome.Addictive viewing. 9/10"]
