['Wes Anderson\'s films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes "The Grand Budapest Hotel" worth seeing. It\'s an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it\'s filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson\'s other films, it\'s full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it\'s NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you\'ll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won\'t be exactly sure why!']
