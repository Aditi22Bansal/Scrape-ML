["Based on fact movie but the war at Dunkirk. British and French soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk waiting to take a ship back to England. However the Germans are doing a non-stop bombing of Dunkirk beach (where the soldiers are) and the ships coming to save them.Visually this is an impressive movie. The visuals are stunning (especially in IMAX) and the battle sequences are beautifully shot. However there's no emotional involvement with the main characters. You know their names--and that's about it. It's really hard to give a damn if you know nothing about them. I suppose the acting was good but--since they're given nothing to work with--I really couldn't tell.So visually it's impressive but emotionally cold. Try to see it in IMAX."]
