["Buffy may not seem like anything special when first hearing of it, and although it starts as a campy B-horror show, it becomes so much more as it goes along. True, it can be episodic, but that only helps it to have some of the strongest stand-alone episodes I have ever seen on TV, and also some of the most emotionally-involving story lines. Although it's a plot-driven show, it's also about the characterization that comes with it and the different directions in which the writing takes the characters. The mix of comedy, drama, and horror is pretty unique to Joss Whedon, and it's a testament to his talent that no other shows are quite like this one in tone. The show would be nothing without its actors, and for the most part, they surely deliver. Sarah Michelle Gellar's development as an actress throughout the show is pretty amazing, and actors like Alison Hannigan, James Marsters, Emma Caulfield are also among the best and show what they have. Truly, this is a show that stays in the heart. Truly recommended."]
