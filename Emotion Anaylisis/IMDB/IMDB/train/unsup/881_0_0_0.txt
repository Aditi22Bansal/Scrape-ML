["The Originals is much more than some teen supernatural drama. The storyline is extremely compelling and explores an old topic in a new and fresh way. There are no victims in this show, everyone has their own strengths and it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.I also find the cast really likable and even when they return to their old evil ways you can still see the humanity in the characters. I can't help but want to like them as they've been through so much pain in the past.Now I must confess that yes I love all things supernatural including Twilight...but the difference is I am well aware that the Twilight movie is absolutely terrible, and in-spite of that I love it but The Originals is actually good.There's action, romance and great special effects. All round an entertaining show."]
