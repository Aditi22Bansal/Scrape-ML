['The Klingons look too different and way too alien! Can\'t they do better than renewing an old blood war with these guys? Unless they wise up and run it on an existing broadcast platform, I will boycott it. I refuse to be held hostage by yet another pay TV service. Besides, it will not run smoothly on my old computer, so I would only be able to watch it on my Smart-phone or I-pad. The only compelling character I like so far is "Number One", a female human raised by Sarak. She is reminiscent of the charismatic Nichelle Nichols. The science officer is very tall and creepy looking! The graphics and set decoration are quite good but we have now come to expect that these days on TV and movies. The "Orville" has more character and heart and it is free on broadcast TV, albeit it will be seen mostly via cable and satellite dish services. Let U.S. Netflix run it, please. The opener was humorless like the first Star Trek movie!']
