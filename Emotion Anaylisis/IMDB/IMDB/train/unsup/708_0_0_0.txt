['Like it\'s "star" Any Poehler (that\'s not a typo, I know what I said), this show was cute, but predictable & ridicously overrated. A cringey & predictable sad-trombone rom-com that was initially saved by the hilariously cynical character of Ron Swanson, but eventually they ruined him by turning him into a rom-com clich√© too, and I was done.']
