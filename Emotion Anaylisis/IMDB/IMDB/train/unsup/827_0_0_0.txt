["24 doesn't need a review. It only needs viewers watching it. Just that.\nAfter that, episode by episode, season by season, you will feel like your mind, senses are wandering off. You will be feeling yourself detached and flown into the shows' world.No imperfection existed for me throughout, my focus was only to Kiefer Sutherland's voice, acting and the magnetism of the series. He was born to play Jack Bauer.You will be drawn into 24 like nothing you have touched and felt before. The experience will leave you shaken and in awe.\nYou will find yourself hungry, needy, sleepy, but unable to move from your seat.After 18 years, I still have fond memories of the show and sensations that no other series was able to duplicate.A diamond in the world of series and a very personal experience for me, which I will forever cherish and never forget."]
