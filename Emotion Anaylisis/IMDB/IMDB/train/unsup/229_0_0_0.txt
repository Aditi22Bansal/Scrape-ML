['This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives."Wonder Woman" is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that\'s just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.']
