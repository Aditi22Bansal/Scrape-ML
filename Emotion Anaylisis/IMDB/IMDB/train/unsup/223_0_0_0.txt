["Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film."]
