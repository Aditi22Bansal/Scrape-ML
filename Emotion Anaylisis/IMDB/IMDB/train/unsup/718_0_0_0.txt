["I heard about this I was surprised, I loved The Karate Kid which came out in 1984, that starred Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elizabeth Shue, And William Zabka. And part 2 that came out in 1986, but The Karate Kid part 3 that came out in 1989 not so much, but I kind of liked The Next Karate Kid, never really saw the 2010 remake that starred Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan..\nI really enjoyed the show showing how Johnny and Daniel are doing now, and also the other stories that come in the mix. Daniel and Johnny realizing what karate meant to them. There are some throwbacks to the original film, Ralph Macchio and William Zabka get back in there roles perfectly, There are some similarities with original film in some episodes. And the other actors also do well, and the karate scenes are well shot, and the way it ends, I'm eagerly excited for season 2."]
