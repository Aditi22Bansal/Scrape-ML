["Although I believe it has actually only been on TV for 5 years. What a roller-coaster of plot and emotion! Creator: Joseph Weisberg certainly had a winner on his hands and Keri Russell, Mathew Rhys, Holly Taylor, Noah Emmerich, and my favorite character Nina played by Annet Manendru brought this show to life! Anyone who missed this series missed a real treat of entertainment, mystery, thrills, and suspense!My only problem was this last season which (as I understand) is the end of the entire show. It went out in a quiet frenzy with our two main characters making an edgy yet unremarkable escape. Maybe I'm being too picky because I did not expect this to happen. Whatever, I did enjoy this show start to stop.Bravo!"]
