["Kowabunga!! The characters are all classics on this show. What this show does so well when you watch it a lot is defines it's characters sharply & throw in so much comedy that the throw away lines are even great. When you watch this enough & think Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, Moe, Crusty the Clown, Montgomery Burns, & Abu (among others), you get a mental picture of the character & sometimes see people in your real life who resemble them. Some of the resemblance is deliberate when you consider Matt Gronig's mind. Some of it is happen stance.Regardless, the show will always have its critics because it does shoot from the hip & hit raw nerves about almost any subject. In truth, it is that edge that makes it great. It takes any topic & lampoons it. It recreates great scenes from past TV & movies & lampoons them. Nothing is sacred on the Simpons. That's Funny!!!"]
