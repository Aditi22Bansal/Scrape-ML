["When you're blessed with that kind of alluring beauty, you had better back it up with the talent as you put yourself out there. Without the audience's unquestionable addiction to her, this show (now going into a seventh season) is but a minor footnote in the crime drama genre. A lot of money is being spent in this production, but had they taken away the girl's designer clothes and hair and makeup artists, and had just given her a better script to work with.. her real talent would have the opportunity to shine through, and it might have had an increased chance at being a truly worthwhile series. Going through what will be 150 episodes plus is a lot for even the best of productions to withstand... praise the heavens in this instance for fast-forward streaming. PS.. so after eight seasons it falters to such a hurried uneventful demise... just as numerous real-life marriages do as well. Many felt it should have been given the hook long before. Will be interesting to see how-where they all rise from the ashes."]
