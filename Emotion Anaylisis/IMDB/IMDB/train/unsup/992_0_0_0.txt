['It seems possible that Netflix presented the writers with algorithm results from their viewer rating system and said, "OK. Here\'s the budget. Here\'s what our viewers in this demographic want. Go write a series." Frankly, I expected better from Tykwer and The Wachowski\'s. The star of this series is its cinematography. That earned my vote, which would have been much lower without it. The cast is a mixed bag. Miguel Silvestre, a.k.a. Sex-on-a-Spoon, is not only amazingly photogenic but perhaps the most talented. Aml Amen, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt carry their weight in that order. Jaime Clayton is in way over her head. It\'s hard to watch her squeeze out an emotion at times. And who doesn\'t like watching a skinny girl, played by Doona Bae, kick bully ass? Now that\'s entertainment. The plot 1s part "Twin Peaks", part "Twighlight Saga" and part "mishegas". The pseudo-science is really obnoxious at times. The concept of yet another superior subgroup in human society wears badly, especially when these special people blow less special people up or shoot them in the face. But they sure are a sexy bunch, and that\'s what really propels this series. It\'s a hedonistic pleasure, like all the recreational drugs that are seemingly admired by the writers.']
