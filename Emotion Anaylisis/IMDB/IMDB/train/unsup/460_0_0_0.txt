['a sitcom about nothing. it is the first definition. and it seems be the best. because it is only a series of scenes, situations, dark/bitter/absurd humor. and nothing more. a stand up comedian, his family and friends and neighbors, his girlfriends, his crisis, his falls. all in a strange game. but Seinfeld has a small virtue - it is a honest story about life. ordinary life. the life of every day. the life around bizarre people, not comfortable job, the life of errors and mistakes, illusions and need to escape from yours circle. each character is a part from the others, like in the case of Matryoshka dolls. and this fact does Seinfeld unique.']
