["Last kingdom Is nowhere near big-budget productions like Vikings and other recent medieval shows. It lacks any artistic perspective and visuals to back it. No actor can Carry the credability of hardened bloodthirsty Vikings. Costumes feels just tacked on modern day dudes, its B level at Most and not convincing like Vikings and GOT that can be mature. First episode is about a annoying boy who can't act at all, its laughable bad and the drama that follows is not very convincing. A few losers in the kingdom blabbering like old ladies while vikings knocking at their front door. And it gets worse. Its so boring and full of plotholes. It doesnt possess the gritty, feral, Dark and intriguing bits like other tvshows allready has. Fighting scenes are truly bad, no good erotic scenes either. You want this kingdom get burned down the more you watch it.\nI just can't see where all the positive reviews comes from? the last kingdom is something you watch when you absolutely has nothing better to do. Its sub-par with any other random boring medieval show. You watch it and forget about it."]
