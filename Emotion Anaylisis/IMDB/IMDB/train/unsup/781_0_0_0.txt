['This to me has all the suffering so wonderfully dramatised by The Missing with all the driven energy of the detective side of shows such as Prime Suspect or The Tunnel. This is a truly riveting show, brilliantly acted, highly photogenic, and displaying all the professionalism and angst from the investigative side seamlessly contrasted with all heartache and tension of those around the identity of the killer, and the cold ice star of the killer himself.']
