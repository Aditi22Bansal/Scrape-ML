["American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film directed by Mary Harron based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the title. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, ChloÃ« Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece."]
