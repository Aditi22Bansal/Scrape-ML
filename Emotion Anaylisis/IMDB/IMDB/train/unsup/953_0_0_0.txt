['This has to be the most over-rated series in TV history,\nin the begging, 1st 2 seasons, I watched. It was "OK" with some moments.\nthere are maybe some episodes, or some scenes that were good.\nthe longer it was on, the more annoyed I got with this....\ndeath comes unexpectedly, which is to value life more.\nclich√©, everyone dies. death is never comfortable for the living.\nwhether unexpected or not.Mortuary is a good business. even in a recession. it doesn\'t suggest any proclivity or special interest in death. and I am sure one gets used to dead bodies. It\'s a family business.but as it goes on, it gets worse. and the same old theme really drags.\nand the girlfriend, who goes off the rails, I couldn\'t care less. and the dynamics are boring. and "Dexter" who I love later as D., so he is gay coming out is hard. yes we know.\nwatch it if you must, but it is just average at best; I think many actors liked it bec. their friends were on it, and the acting may be "good". but again, that\'s hard to judge if you don\'t like the material.']
