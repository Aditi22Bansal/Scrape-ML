["I guess years ago I watched; I put up with more and would watch a slow 4 star. And early on, it wasn't as repetitious. Barely entertaining. boring, bad acting. I didn't like the characters and the plot lines were mundane. The thing I hated most, was Mark Harmon as the wise kind father figure, who protects and likes women. Having met him once, before NCIS, I was offended in a very casual exchange. Michael now has a spin off, always seemed way too full of himself. OK, he was a model. Reading some on set problems, with Pauly speaking out about being terrorized, and what happened to Cote, forced to leave? They were too popular. And others with both Mark and Michael on his set, I see my perceptions of them were correct. Now, you can say who they are shouldn't influence how I perceive their performances. but who they are showed in their performances. Smug. Neither are the best actors. I thought People's sexy man of the year for Mark Harmon years ago was laughable. I do think, it is fair to look at an actor, and say, I don't like you, as an actor and for what you've done.\nBeside that, the story lines and characters are just boring. Sure. it's hard to get a new spin on an old theme. But that's no excuse."]
