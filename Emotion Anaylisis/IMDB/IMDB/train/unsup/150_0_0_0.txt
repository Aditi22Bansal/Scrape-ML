['This is the final Harry Potter film, where Harry Potter and the gang destroys the remaining horcruxes and battles with Voldemont."Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" signifies the end of a decade of Harry Potter films. Fortunately, it is a great film, ending the series on a high note. The pacing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fast, meaning action happens almost non-stop. Watching Harry Potter and the other wizards in Hogwarts in dire danger from Voldemont is very engaging. The special effects are very smooth and realistic, and one can only be marvelled by the complexity of the special effects in the battle scene. The only complaint I have is the underwhelming 3D effects. In most scene the 3D is barely noticeable, and there is only one scene involving fragments scattering in the sky that the 3D is spectacular. So watch the 2D version to save money.']
