["LOGAN (2017) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Richard E. Grant, Eriq La Salle, Elis Neal, Quincy Fouse. Spectacularly supreme swan song for X-Men anti-hero Wolverine AKA Logan (the erstwhile, world-weary Jackman having a field day in his strongest outing as Wolfie) set in the near future whose attempts to remain off the grid are thwarted when a new mutant (amazing new comer Keen) has been discovered by his old friend Professor Xavier (ditto Stewart) which also crops up old nemesis The Reavers led by hissable Holbrook hot on their trail. Director James Mangold (who co-wrote with Scott Frank & Michael Green) enfuses the franchise spin-off with some new insights and a damn well pay dirt in going very dark and very graphically (and wholeheartedly welcome) unleashed violence. At its heart is literally that - heart, surprisingly well-crafted and executed particularly with dynamo Keen (a cross between The Road Warrior's Feral Kid and Kick-Ass' Hit Girl) gloweringly lethal."]
