["I honesty don't understand how this show doesn't get as much buzz as some of the other adult cartoons out there. This amazing show is smart, cynical, funny, perfectly voiced and suitably animated (the only reason that I took off a star form a perfect rating, though with time you absolutely get used to the style of animation).\nIt has almost perfect character development throughout the series without too much drama. Captivating characters that in my opinion so much better than all other similar cartoons. Absolutely amazing re-watch value (I watched all the seasons up to date at least several times). This show did get a cult following and I'm really happy that it got renewed (hopefully for many more seasons), but it should be definitely have much more buzz.Keep on creating!"]
