["I have liked this series from the beginning. I do have some gripes however. Why don't the characters call each other by their first names overall? Even after they get married Beckett and Castle call each other by their last names. I see this on other series. It is very annoying. They have been working together a long time. Enough already. Also, if you have attractive women let them dress to show off their looks. Stana Katic and Tamala Jones are very attractive, let them show it. This happens too infrequently. I think the mix of comedy and mystery is just right. Leave it as is. The other annoying point is Susan Sullivan's accent. It is extremely annoying. It is like closing my eyes and hearing Katherine Hepburn. I found her accent annoying even in short sentences. I remember her in a perry mason movies in the '80's or '90's. She did not have the accent then. Get rid of it. I like the series regardless of my gripes."]
