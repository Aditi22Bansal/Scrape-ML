["There is plenty of stress to go around in this television series. Practically everyone is drinking and smoking to their heart's content. These are men caught up in a frenzy of an advertising agency. They would literally cut each other up if given the opportunity to do so.There are plenty of modern day issues to tackle as we saw this evening when during a fire at a hotel, it's determined that one of the executives is a homosexual.Everything is supposed to be done nicely and to fit in place. This includes the firing of an executive whose dismissal was held up while his wife underwent radiation treatments. Two people have been promoted to take his place. The fired executive's parting scene was comical. He didn't exactly accept going out quietly.An interesting show, but where can all this lead to ultimately?"]
