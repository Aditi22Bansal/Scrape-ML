["'Scrubs' was at the start a nice funny alternative to the more heavy medical shows like 'ER'. It made a star out of Zach Braff, and ran successfully for many series, without really ever setting the world alight.It was a modern comedy, so of course it's unfortunately a given that it's full of sex jokes and stupidity, but the charm of Braff and many other of the cast saves things slightly.The network knew it had a hit on its hands, so this show got milked until it was not funny It's a shame, because at its peak, this show was better than most."]
