["As a kid who grew up in the early to mid-`90s watching cartoons like Ren & Stimpy, Beavis and Butt-Head, and Rocko's Modern Life. This is a cartoon that is similar to those but not as daring. The new generation of children have a different taste from mine so the cartoons today are obviously different and I can understand that but with a cartoon like SpongeBob it is nice to see a cartoon that represents those of my generation. This is a funny cartoon and who can forget the episode where SpongeBob and Patrick were cursing. Hilarious!"]
