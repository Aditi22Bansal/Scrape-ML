["Patrick Jane helps the CBI, led by Lisbon to find the guilty using his special talent to read people. At the same time he searches for the killer known as 'Red John', whose responsible for the murder of Jane's wife and child.I watch this show on a Friday after a long hard day of college, I laugh and laugh at Jane's exploits, his mannerisms, his quirky nature and his charming nature. More importantly, Jane is supported by the double act that is Kimbal Cho and Wayne Rigsby, they are just plain out funny, having their little banter between drives from crime scenes, Van Pelt adds the awkwardness that is simply hilarious, when she is around Rigsby.For me the hook was the end of the pilot, when we realise Red John history with Jane, simply stunning....One of the finest scenes I've ever seen.The one thing that does concern me, is the length of the Red John mystery, viewers may grow bored of the endless clues and near-misses to catch the serial killer....But, I'll always keep watching...."]
