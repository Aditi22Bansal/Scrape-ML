['Diversity is good but Jimmy Olsen has red hair and freckles, for God\'s sake! He\'s not a tall Black basketball player! Also, too many people know who she is! It\'s not much of a secret! Special effects look pretty good and "Supergirl" certainly looks the part. Wrong hair color! She should be a blond, not strawberry-blonde! Good casting! The violence is a bit intense. A villain\'s death in the pilot was unnecessary, in my opinion, even if it is a Krypton alien. Some good touches: A man is stronger than a girl even on Krypton and although "invulnerable" by Earth standards, not totally so against fellow aliens. Please don\'t turn this into another "Buffy" series, please! Future episodes will tell. Even "Smallville" was bad for a while with it\'s "monster of the week" concept. The airplane rescue scene was fabulous and so were Dean Cain and Helen Slater as her Earth parents. "Allie Mcbeal" is the perfect "foil" as Kara\'s overbearing boss. We shall see about the rest. Superman should show up from time-to-time too. Who will play him?']
