["This show, perhaps my favorite, is a good blend of drama, comedy, wholesomeness, and romance. Castle, on the show, is a very prolific writer. (Maybe Fillon is too.) At the same time, he is a good father with that daughter of his. (Molly O'Quinn does a very good turn in the series.) And, of course, Susan Sullivan is a very appealing icon. Not only is Castle a good writer, but what would the NYPD do without him? Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic, is an unusually attractive lady very conscientious about her job. The plots of each episode keep the viewer wondering until almost the very last second: as a rule, you won't know the identity of the criminal till then. The comedy comes about when Castle and Beckett conduct persiflage with each other. Sometimes the jokes may be groaners, but you never tire from hearing them. What has always struck my attention...and this is nothing astounding...is whether or not they would ever have a lasting romance. I did like the last episode of the past season. A wonderful series. May it last forever."]
