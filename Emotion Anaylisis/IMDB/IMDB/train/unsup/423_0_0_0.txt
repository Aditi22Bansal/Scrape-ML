['This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang."Taken" has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it\'s full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. "Taken" is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced.']
