["There are two distinctly different versions of this Film. The theatrical American release called The Professional and the International and Home Video cut titled Leon: The Professional or just Leon. The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer. It is an uncompromising and unconventional uncovering of some uncomfortable realities that are challenging as well as engaging. It is a Movie that can isolate many but also endear those willing to take on a bit more than usual."]
