["Supernatural was the reigning king of entertainment during it's first five seasons by mixing different cultures and human driven stories together like a melting pot.Despite the lackluster plot, the mystery of what caused to two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, mother to die in a firey blaze hooked a large audience right away and helped the new CW show to soar to heights not seen before.It was intelligently written, had clever villains that could outwit the leads in the brains department and out up a good fight instead of making them an untouchable superman ahead of the game.They had to use research, skull and think of new ways to defeat the for keeping it refreshing.Having a sibling myself, it was nice to see the schisms and talks the brothers had after a hard day. It brought it down to a personal level of what defines and makes a family. A theme that resonates several times on the show all the way back to Cain and Abel to the apocalyptic fight between Michael and Lucifer.The humor is prevalent throughout when the boys use fake ids to Cain access to crime scenes, unintended sexual situations or their Angel friend Cas tries to understand how humanity ticks.The atmosphere was wonderful adding to the eerie campfire stories they were telling.While the show has gone down in quality in recent years there is still a spark left lit to enjoy."]
