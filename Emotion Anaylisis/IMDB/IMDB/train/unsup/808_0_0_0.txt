["Captivating well deserving of the awards it's earned! Poignant delight and heartwarming constantly! Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Borstein are lovely; Rachel is gorgeous I love her. I bet Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is quite a feat to make in many aspects like the writing, set designs, clothing, and choreography. Very enjoyable I'm I decided to watch season 3."]
