["It is an end of an era, more or less. Bravo, they did a great job ending it, even though they still haven't really ended it. Well, I stopped watching so it ended for me. Seriously, the guys behind Naruto should just end it. Baruto looks promising but give us a break already, stop milking beloved franchises into the ground. Dragonball Super made a joke out of the DBZ universe and Baruto could do just the same thing to Naruto. Anyway, if you are planning on watching this series or watching it again then I recommend doing what I did, skipping all of the filler episodes. Seriously, a fillerless viewing of this show is literally animated art as far as I am concerned."]
