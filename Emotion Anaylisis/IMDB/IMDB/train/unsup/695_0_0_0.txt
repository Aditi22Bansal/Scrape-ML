["This season of The 100 stresses the fact that despite our moral compasses we all have devils inside us whuch have to be overcome in order for us to heal and move forward. For some, it's a more prominent force and takes several mistakes to drive the sword through the demon, although the heart-wrenching journey and action of the battle is an out-of-this-world experience.Clarke's journey starts when she meets her counterpart in the form of Josephine Lightbourn (Sara Thomas), a thrilling sociopathic princess with more depth, wits, and complexity than any anti-hero is allowed to have. Being stuck inside her own head gives the female lead ample opportunity to reflect and straighten out her choices with the help of a few blasts from the past.Eliza Taylor does an outstanding job with her acting in the way she portrays Clarke, Josephine and the one as the other. She switches skins with careful ease and a perfect amount of the imposter's characteristics. Clarke's compassion subtly shines through during the ruse, while Josephine's lack thereof is just as clear.While this is absolutely Clarke's season, most of the characters have to face-off with their previous mistakes."]
