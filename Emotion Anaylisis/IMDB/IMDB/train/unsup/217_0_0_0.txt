['It is said that Steven Spielberg was heavily influenced by the serials of the golden era, the thirties and forties, produced for the best of them, by Republic Pictures studios and directed by the likes of Bill Witney and John English or Spencer Gordon Bennett, with the great Yakima Kanutt as the master stunt scenes, more outstanding one than the other. And when I watch this film, the best of Spielberg - concerning the."leisure" part of Spielberg\'s filmography - and among the best features in the movie history, I can\'t prevent myself to admit that it is a serial from the eighties. Even nearly forty years after discovering it, I am still amazed, which is not the case for many movies from the eighties, films that I discovered in my early adult life and that don\'t belong to my childhood - another life for me, as many people. When you are a child, movies are not seen the same way as when you find them when you are an adult. So back to this one, everything has already been said, I just wanted to point out the serial tribute. And I discovered forties serial from Republic pictures when I was thirty years old, already a adult.']
