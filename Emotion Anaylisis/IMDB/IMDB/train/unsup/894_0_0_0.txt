['As someone who was a bit of an outcast in school, "Glee" is pretty interesting for me. Having just binge-watched the first season, I\'d say that this look at a collection of high school students participating in the glee club is a good show. As it was, a lot of the songs that they perform I learned from "Weird Al" Yankovic\'s spoofs (e.g., "Like a Virgin" became "Like a Surgeon").I\'ll be eager to see the rest of the series. I like how it develops the characters\' personal lives as the show progresses and avoids stereotyped characters. Indeed, I expected Kurt\'s father to be a hard-ass but he accepts his son\'s homosexuality. Even the malevolent Sue Sylvester has her own story.So far I like this show. I\'ll have to see the following seasons. It\'s too bad that Cory Monteith died of a drug overdose.']
