["This show is a complete mess! Every character has somehow completely went insane. I hate every single one of them. There's the same ridiculous plot lines. It's never end. They especially love to add random sex scenes. And the one couple I keep hoping for (that's not toxic) won't end up together. And I mean Betty and Archie. But, we just get the same old toxic couple pairings. I really want to skip the whole show and stop but, it's such a train wreck. How could I? I suggest start with season 1 and finish at season 2."]
