["I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books."]
