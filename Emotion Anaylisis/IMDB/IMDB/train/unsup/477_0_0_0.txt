["This t.v. show is excellent, it's one of my favorites. Everything about it is excellent, acting, characters, story lines, plots, production, costumes, photography, directing, script and expression. Although, I like everyone on the show my favorite character is Abby.My favorite episode is the one when that brutal vicious, monster killer, Kyle Boone was executed. He deserved to be killed after all the horrible things he did. My biggest question is, why would he keep the locations of his victims' bodies a secret for so long? How could he not just tell them and let their families bury them and have closure? He kept everyone in so much pain.Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. 10 out of 10 stars. Two Thumbs Way Up!"]
