['Superman is undoubtedly one of the most ancient superheroes of many generations in many countries. The story of Kal-el and the fate of his doomed planet Krypton are absolutely well-known of most persons. Along the decades, we have read comic books and seen movies in the theaters and shows in television with minor modifications or deviations from the original story. "Man of Steel" is an awful reinvention of the Superman, with explosions plus explosions and CGI. However, the essence of the superhero is gone. It is ridiculous the destruction of the entire city to save Earth and the visual concept of Krypton and the Phantom Zone; actually they are pretext to use more CGI and explosions. Clark Kent letting his father die? Superman killing villains? If there is no other possibility of writing a new decent adventure of this superhero, let\'s him rest in peace and create a new hero. But do not destroy the Superman. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "O Homem de AÃ§o" ("The Man of Steel")']
