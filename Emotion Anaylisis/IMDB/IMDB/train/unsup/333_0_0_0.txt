['Russell Crowe\'s stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely. No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured. Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his "unsuitable" private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.']
