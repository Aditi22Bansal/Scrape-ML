['"CSI" takes the viewer into the world of forensic criminal investigations set against the glitz and glitter of the Las Vegas strip. "Mr. Vanilla" (Petersen) leads the Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) unit comprised of a bunch of actors who look like a bunch of actors while playing it fast and loose with the forensic sciences. Tight, fast moving, and formulaic, "CSI" solves cases like an Energizer bunny on "Speed" with no room for character development, emotional investments, back stories, buy-ins, and drama. The result is a hugely popular fare of fast food for small screen freaks which will play best with less sophisticated and discerning TV viewers. More sophisticated audiences might want to check out "Homicide:Life in the Streets", "Prime Suspect", "Cracker" and the like  to satisfy their more jaded palates. (B-)']
