['With his wife (Rosamund Pike)\'s disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man (Ben Affleck) sees the spotlight turned on him when it is suspected that he may not be innocent.Not being familiar with the source material, most of the twists and turns came completely unexpected. And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the "Madea" guy. The plot slows down a bit in the third act, but overall is a tense thriller that is sure to please any movie fan. David Fincher has not made a bad movie yet.']
