['"Trainspotting" is currently #154 on IMDb\'s Top 250 list. As an insane film buff, I have been trying to watch as many of the movies from the list as possible and have seen about 235 of them However, now the ones I have left to watch are mostly films I normally would have no interest in seeing--so at the outset, I am not the most favorably disposed person towards this film. After all, I don\'t have a lot of interest in seeing a film about a bunch of loser heroin addicts--and that is the theme of "Trainspotting".Some who watched this film felt it was a comedy--I noticed this when reading through the reviews. However, I really didn\'t find this film funny nor do I think most would think it funny. I guess my definition of funny isn\'t watching people injecting heroin, babies dying of neglect and people crapping themselves. You\'ll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film. While director Danny Boyle did a good job of making it all seem realistic, the film was so repellent that I can\'t understand its popular appeal. And now that I finished watching it, I am thinking twice about my crazy notion of seeing all 250. Gross and unappealing.']
