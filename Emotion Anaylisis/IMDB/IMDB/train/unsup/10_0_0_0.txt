['"Titanic" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn\'t already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn\'t perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there\'s no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn\'t exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron\'s other huge success, "Avatar". Well worth seeing once.']
