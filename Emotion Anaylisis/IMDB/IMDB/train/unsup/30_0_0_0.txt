['If you\'ve watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in \'08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics\' late creator of many of the company\'s popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, "Excelsior!"']
