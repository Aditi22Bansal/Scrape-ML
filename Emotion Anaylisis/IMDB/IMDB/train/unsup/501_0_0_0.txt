["I really loved this show in the beginning. Cool scripts, acting on point and focused on crime solving. Opinions were absent. Later, politics took over the show, too bad. It's now all about Mariska, Mariska, Mariska - definitely wandered away from crime solving into raising a child and crying tears. I have plenty of old shows and movies to watch...this one is off my list now. Time to cancel."]
