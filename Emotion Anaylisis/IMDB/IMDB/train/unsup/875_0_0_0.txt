["Firstly the people giving a positive rating to Season Two positively are single use accounts, using a lot of similar phrasing. IE marketing people, not actual audience.Lets get this straight: Tom Clancy was not Proust, he wrote reasonably well written, highly studied on the facts, but not great novels. But his work is NOT marvel comics and this series has become a comic book nonsense. Thirdly, Clancy did sometimes do the geopolitics in broad strokes, but he never ever would have made the basic error of portraying a socialist dictator as a right wing dictator. Where were the fact checkers for this series when some idiot inverted a basic geopolitical fact (Venezuela's left wing dictatorship into right wing) ???Krasinki walks through this second season as if he didn't care. Maybe it is his over-rated acting skills or maybe he knew the script was so bad that he didn't care, but he is almost sneering at the audience with his portrayal.Really everything about season two is cringe-worthy."]
