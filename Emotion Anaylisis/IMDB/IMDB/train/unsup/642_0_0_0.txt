["Purely based on the excellent actors and their skills I rate True Detective at seven stars. But that's just because the actors are really top notch. You can't fault any of them. Remarkable acting. But other then that this show is way too complicated to make it have a better score. And that's a pity. The amount of different characters make it difficult to watch. It's sometimes also a bit slow. I just finished the second season and the ending was disappointing. But for the rest you get a show with excellent filming, excellent sound and excellent actors. I don't get why they want to make it so complicated. Just simplify it a bit and you get one of the best series on television. If they would make a third season I will probably watch it. But to me they can just stop after those two seasons. There are way better shows then this one."]
