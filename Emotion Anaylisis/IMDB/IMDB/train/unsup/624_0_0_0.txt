['Very popular zombie series.I am not the biggest zombie fan, but that view seems to work for me here as the zombies in this show are less visible.The first season almost seems like a prediction of what was to come in 2020 as a small community is placed in lockdown (to keep the zombies out) by the military.Suspense, mystery, drama, science fiction, horror, some great characters - there is so much here!However, this is a grim series, so I would suggest viewing in moderation (maybe one season every six months) as when watching too much in one hit - the viewer feels as depressed as the characters in the show.But in a nutshell - a good show.']
