["I rarely give an animated series a 10, but this one deserves it.It's fast, it's incredibly creative, it's incredibly smart, it's got a budget, and that budget appears to be spent on talented individuals who treat it like a true labor of love.What does that creative team eat for breakfast?Warning: Adult language and situations. The main adult lead, Rick, is by turns unfathomably jaded and outwardly blase, with occasion twinges of true humanity. The beauty of that is, when he does show these twinges, they whup you upside the haid.The Pilot was a tad shaky, but it seems to have only taken one episode to become a rick-roaring phenom.Check it out!"]
