["Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie. Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.Disappointing, but entertaining enough."]
