['Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, "I\'m going to shoot you if you don\'t slow down." They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are "I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down." The drama teacher tells his students, "I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson\'s horse..."The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing\'s chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a "track star" while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity']
