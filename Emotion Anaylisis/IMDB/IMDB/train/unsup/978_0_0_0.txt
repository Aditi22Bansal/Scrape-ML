["I had my doubts about this show at first, but now I feel it's the best political drama TV series.Right off the start I was annoyed by Kiefer Sutherland's 1960's eyeglasses... really, wardrobe came up with that idea?Anyhow, I got used to them and more importantly very impressed with Kiefer Sutherland's performance as well as the entire cast.The writing in every episode is amazing and the directing and cinematography is on point.Every government should use this show on how it should be run and how a president should act. That said, Kiefer Sutherland for President!A perfect TV series I hope has endless season. 10/10 from me!"]
