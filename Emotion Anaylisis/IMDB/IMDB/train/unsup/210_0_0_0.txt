["In 1978, I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman and believed a man could fly (gimme a break... I was only 10); 1989, and The Rocketeer made me want to soar across the heavens (and, being 21, also get off with Jennifer Connelly). Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."]
