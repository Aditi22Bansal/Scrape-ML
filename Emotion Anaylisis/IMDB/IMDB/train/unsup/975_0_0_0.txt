['Years ago, I used to work for my government, and since that time I have maintained some interest in related issues, and that is why I tend to follow political series from different countries. True, I am selective in this, trying to avoid the depiction of blunt superiority and propaganda, but names like Guggenheim and Sutherland have been a sign of quality to me.Well, the US series have usually certain angles, approaches and topics not self-evident in other countries, but if you know then beforehand, you just accept them as an integral part and realise that you cannot expect the same attitudes and themes as e.g. in Borgen (Denmark). Run of events and characters in the White House seem plausible, the outcomes logical - bearing in mind the PresidentÂ´s "forced" evolution and tragic benchmark. Well, the events related to Agent Wells tend to be more "action" and not always compatible to what is going on arond Kirkman, but they are noo too disconcerting. Despite the Season 2 is less interesting and versatile than 1, it ends in a way that suggests the Season 3 - but not coming according to the latest information. So the all thing remains incomplete, without proper round-up.All in all, it is no House of Cards, but thanks to K. Sutherland and K. Penn, above all, it is pleasant to watch. And when taking account into current US president, then perhaps a guy like Kirkman would be more becoming option...']
