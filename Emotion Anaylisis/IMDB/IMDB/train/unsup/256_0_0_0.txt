["This is the funniest of the Coen brother's films that I've seen to date. The film follows the story of slacker Jeffrey Lebowski (AKA The Dude) who is mistaken for a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski by a couple of thugs wanting money owed by the latter's wife.Encouraged by his easily angered friend Walter, The Dude goes to see the other Lebowski to get a rug to replace one damaged by the thugs. When Lebowki's wife is kidnapped he asks The Dude to help deliver the ransom. While this is going on The Dude and his friends are also involved in preparations for a bowling match.From then on things get stranger and stranger in events featuring German nihilists, a pornographer, Lebowski's daughter and a bowler by the name of Jesus.The cast led by Jeff Bridges is excellent as the story is fun and in places rather surreal, if you don't mind a lot of swearing and enjoy a good laugh this film is a must see."]
