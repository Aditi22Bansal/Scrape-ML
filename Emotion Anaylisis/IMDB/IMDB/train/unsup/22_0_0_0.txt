['Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We\'re talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I\'d see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a "thrill park ride". Now that doesn\'t mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don\'t compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie']
