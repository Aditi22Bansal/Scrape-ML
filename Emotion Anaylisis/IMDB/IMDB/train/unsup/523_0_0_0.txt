['"Supernatural" was an off-the-wall, brand new, super awesome show when I first watched. I was all in. Sam and Dean were cool and they were going Van Helsing on the underworId. I followed the adventures of Sam and Dean faithfully until Dean died and was pulled out of wherever-he-was by an angel. I can\'t even remember the season, but I just remember thinking, "They\'re just throwing darts at a board now." I never expected it to keep going for as long as it did. It was good for the time I watched, but I\'m glad I got off the ride when I did.']
