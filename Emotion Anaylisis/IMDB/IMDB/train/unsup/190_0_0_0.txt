['Good Will Hunting is a great film.  It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math.  This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change.  The way the film shows us Will , Sean and the supporting characters is spectacular and nothing is funnier than a Boston accent.  Great all around.']
