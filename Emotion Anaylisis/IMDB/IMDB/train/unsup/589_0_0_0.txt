["I just love this show there's absolutely nothing to hate about it there's very smart jokes,memorable episodes and such fantastic characters,and the amazing thing is its considered one of the best T.V. shows in history and its a cartoon and its also been around for more than 20 years,this show is easily the greatest show ever made theirs classical characters such as Homer,Bart,Marge,Lisa,Maggie,Apu,Grampa,D.R. Hibbert,Groundskeeper Willie,Principal Skinner,Otto,Sideshow Bob,Chief Wiggum,Santas Little Helper,Ned Flanders,Nelson,Moe,M.R. Burns,Milhouse,Smithers,Barney and Krusty and it also has gotten more than 400 episodes and with all the things that can happen around Springfield and a tree house of horror every season it will never run out of ideas,the Simpsons is without a doubt my favourite show and I give it a deserved 10/10."]
