["Outlander has been around from 2014 and has year by year become a firmly focused story, which in season 3, episode 8, has now reached a new pinnacle.Never having read any of the books, the theme was unknown to me and certainly has grown in esteem over the years. It took us from the late 1940's to the Scottish highlands in the past, with infighting, disputes, intrigue and outright war. The characters are well developed and play their roles perfectly. In this new phase, 20 story-years later, it is transforming into a powerful, compassionate and personal tale with revelations of those missing 20 years, leaving a posing conundrum. It raises the status of this series exponentially and compels me to increase my rating from 8 to 9!"]
