['Frank Darabont brings Stephen King\'s novel to life. It stays true to the book and will hold your interest the whole three hours running time. Tom Hanks is a prison guard that befriends one giant of a prisoner played by Michael Duncan. Amazing things begin to happen on the "Green Mile" leading to execution on death row. Also turning in stunning performances are Michael Jeter, Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Rockwell. This drama has it\'s humorous moments. This is a dark and moody tale that is Oscar worthy.']
