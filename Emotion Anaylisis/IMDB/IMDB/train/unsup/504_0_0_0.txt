['I probably should give this show more of a chance, but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it, I probably won\'t watch it again. Most of the time, British comedies, when taken over by Americans, don\'t seem to make it. "Fawlty Towers," which lasted all of five minutes, comes to mind. This appears to be one of them. There were some very funny moments, and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version.The boss, plain and simple, is a complete moron. Totally out of it, he thinks he\'s a role model and hilariously funny, when all the while he\'s a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks, does Three Stooges impressions, and is emotionally abusive (firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears). It\'s a great setup for a fabulous character, but I found him only annoying.I\'m afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp\'s: embarrassed, appalled, and not finding much funny.']
