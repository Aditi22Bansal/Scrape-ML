['. . . because that\'s where ALL of his power resides. James Bond might be able to fight his way out of predicaments in the buff (think the second CASINO ROYALE), but NOT Mr. S. Even when he climbs into a bathtub with a stark naked Amy Adams during BATMAN V. SUPERMAN, he\'s fully dressed. That\'s because Superman\'s Red Cape and Blue Onesie ARE part of his Birthday Suit (making him a good bet to win any game of strip poker). Perhaps the biggest revelation of VERSUS is that the moms of every D.C. Comic "Super Hero" are named "Martha," just like the Mother of Our Country (Mrs. Washington). That\'s because the D.C. Boys and their Picturizers (Warner Bros.) are a pretty patriotic pack, and they realize that the only good E.T. is a dead E.T. While Marvel\'s Mob of Mutants gets thousands of Muggles murdered in each of their outings, Superman gets raked over the coals here for the least little smidgen of "collateral damage." So bang the drum slowly and play the fife lowly as another Caped One bites the dust.']
