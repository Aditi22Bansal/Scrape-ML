["This is one of the most incredible television shows I've ever seen. At the beginning the story comes into focus very quickly and the rest of the multi-episode show takes the viewer on a long roller coaster ride where we meet a cast of characters in a town like many others, with varying degrees of virtue and vice, covering a wide spectrum of British society. In truth, it could be anywhere. The mood is dark and psychological forces are at war. The town where this movie takes place could be anywhere and yet it seems like a place we all know because it exposes the secrets, the paranoia, the fears of being caught amid the casual friendships and veneer that we call everyday life. Dark music accompanies the progress of the show as we see one person after another cringe with fear as to where the next blow will land. Yet, we also see how human nature can rebound and lost souls can rally together and forge unity when crime pulls people apart. David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker, and Andrew Buchan are outstanding in this series. There are no heroes, only victims. If you want escapist entertainment, don't watch this. However, if you want to find out how we react when the social order seems to become unhinged as the result of a single crime, this show will deliver superbly."]
