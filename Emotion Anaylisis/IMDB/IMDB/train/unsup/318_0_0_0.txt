['Great movie - funny and moving. Engaging and emotive, with some hilarious scenes. Takes a while to get going, but once it does, it moves along at a brisk pace.Great performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.Historic movie too. The first funny, non-dull and unpretentious French movie. Also the first French movie to not be all about people contemplating the meaning of life for 90+ minutes and then at least one of them committing suicide at the end (spoiler alert).']
