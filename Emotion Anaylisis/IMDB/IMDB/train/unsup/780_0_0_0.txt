['"How to Get Away with Murder" tells the story of a group of aspiring law students whose lifes balance out of control when a dead girl and a missing girlfriend seem to be linked to their professor\'s husband, resulting in a murder with widespread consequences.This series really keeps you gasping. It develops from what seems to be a steady scheme in the first season into something much bigger and darker that gives you little chance to see through events in advance. There are times when it feels like producers couls lose you but until now they always managed to come up with new plot lines that increase the suspense again and appear realistic enough to not be ridiculous. Even when I agree that a few seasons less would have been no harm, this should still be a role model for many shows because the level of suspense it builds and keeps up is enormous. What in other shows would be a great cliff hanger is here just another turn within an episode.All in all this is definitely worth a watch. It\'s not the most realistic series ever and emotionally exhausting at times but definitely keeps you thrilled and searching for answers.']
