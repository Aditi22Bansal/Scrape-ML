["Was I looking forward to pick in on a series about the superheroes of Marvel, that's what I thought to see and that's exactly what they told me. Seeing trailers and interviews and seen that the director was already involved in full features about the superheroes I was ready to watch episode one.And after seeing episode one this series looked great. This I wanted to follow until the pilot was done and we moved further into the real world of SHIELD. And from that moment things went totally wrong for me. We moved 100% away from the superheroes. And after 6 episodes I was disgusted by the series. From an excellent opening it turned into a childish series that even looked fine for teenagers. There's nothing happening at all. Well, there is, the opening something happening and once the agents comes in it's full of clich√©s. The boss coming up for his crew, the sexy looking infiltrated chick, the nerdie chick, the freak, the yawn, macho man and...zzzzzzzzz.The effects used are rather good but I admit, after episode 6 I closed the door. Nothing 'marvel'ous here to see. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"]
