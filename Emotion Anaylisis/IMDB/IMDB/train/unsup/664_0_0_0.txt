["Set in the 24th century and decades after original crew of the starship Enterprise, the new Enterprise NCC 1701-D is commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).This is a follow up to the TV series (1966-69) and the success of the movies made after. This is a slightly more flashy setup. They're using more CG. The big addition is the holodeck, an artificially created environment, which is basically a virtual reality. This series is most notable for restarting the series with a sequel and new characters/actors. This would lead to even more movies. It is definitely a worthy continuation of the Star Trek universe. That is not always a guarantee especially for an iconic series like Star Trek."]
