["Literally and metaphorically speaking. It's the most disjointed show I know, quality wise. The first round (season 1 to 4) only had two great seasons, 2 and 3. The second (season 5 to 8) is so boring around the second half of season 7, you wonder why bother watching the 8th. Fortunately proving you wrong, when you do, because it's one of the best the show's ever had, with 6 and 3, so far. Adding season 2 and 5 as my personal pick. Then part three (from season 9 to 11) is where the quality and genuineness, left the hospital. I even consider season 11 finale last shot to bring the series closure. And the following season to be part of a different chapter, for die hard fans only. Which I'm clearly not, because from season 12 onward, I stopped following it on TV, and only watch episodes whenever I felt like it, or curious about the music placements (which is without a doubt, one of the highlights of the whole series). I can't really blame the acting, it's good overall. But the writing got extremely ridiculous and repetitive after a while. Pushing more commonplaces and other biases, « narrow minded » people like me hate so much... All in all, it's a good medical drama, that often leans towards soap opera territory at more than one occasion. But it didn't age well, both in the way it picks subjects and characters to focus on."]
