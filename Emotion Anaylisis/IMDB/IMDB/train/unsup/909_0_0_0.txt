["Elementary sells itself fairly well, but it's almost a direct copy of House but for policework - the cases are convoluted, but unlike the medical seem to rely on a deus ex machina even more than House. Thus the Monk connection. The characters of Holmes and Watson are OK, but I just can't connect with them enough to make this primetime viewing of choice.All in all, this is adequate rather than great TV, the writer (who is also executive producer) seems to work out strange cases and expect us to fit our credulity to it - it would be better with a little bit more research and footwork and little less random associations.The show will do well, but I for one cannot rave about it."]
