['Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a paranoid schizophrenic anti-social teenager having therapy with Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross) and using medication. He has visions of a giant rabbit, Frank, the Fuzzy Bunny, who instructs him to make violent acts, like destroying the fire hydrant and piping to flood his high-school like in Graham Greene\'s book, which text was read in his English class, or burning to the ground the house of the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Donnie is not at home when an engine turbine falls of a plane into his bedroom without any explanation. He predicts the doomsday and is very interested in time travel through the wormhole."Donnie Darko" is one of the weirdest cult movies ever. Richard Kelly follows the same school of David Lynch, making a very intriguing movie with the usual elements of this director, such as in "The Lost Highway", using characters very bizarre and dark. The story is confusing and quite nonsense but holds the attention until the very end, with great cast and performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Donnie Darko"Note: On 16 November 2014, I saw this movie again.']
