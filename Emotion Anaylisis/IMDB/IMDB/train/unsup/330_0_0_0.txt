["This is Fluff. Razzle Dazzle Revealing Itself to be Nothing More than Eye Candy . A Misdirection that is so Self Confident it Decides that Complicated Plot Convolutions and Unengaging Characters are Acceptable because this is just So Much Fun.But it isn't. Suspension of Disbelief Distracts from Real Illusionism. That what is seen Live on Stage is Sabotaged by the Simple Fact that this is a Movie and this Type of Thing Pales in Comparison to what is Done Weekly by Hollywood's Digital Artist. The Strength of the Tricks is Never Realized and are so Ho-Hum that the Director must have been Aware of this because His Idea of Entertainment is to Send the Camera in Circular Motion in just about Every Scene.As Dizziness Sets In, the Viewer can become Disoriented and Misdirected to the Limitations of the Stage Show to Film Show and are Beyond Focus as the Mind becomes Woozy and the Stomach is Ready to Purge.Its a Pretty Picture and has a Cast of A-List Types that are having a Good Time with Barely much Effort. If this is a Good Time for You, So Be It. Just don't be Bothered Trying to Figure it Out because All of the Tricks are Revealed, or will be, in the Disc Extras that with Every New Release is Forever Eroding what Fun there is in Watching a Movie. That Movie Magic is No Longer a Wonder, it is a Commentary, and Behind the Scenes Explanations Ad Nauseum."]
