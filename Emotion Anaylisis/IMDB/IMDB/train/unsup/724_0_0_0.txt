["During the first couple seasons this show was great.Although the premise was a bit thin, a guy robs a bank to go to prison with his brother and then has no problem getting to his brother once inside.A bit far fetched for me but it got really good after that.I was even able to overlook the ridiculous idea of them escaping and then ending up in a South American prison, which they were also able to easily escape.After that it just got stupid.They brought in Michael Rappaport as a cop??Don't get me wrong, I loved him on The War At Home but he is not capable of playing a cop or FBI agent or whatever he was.But that wasn't even why the show got bad, they were just out of story ideas.It's a shame to see such a great show die such a horrible, prolonged death but I'm getting use to it.Watch the first three seasons and act like that was all there was."]
