["Its a good show. The whole concept and all. Its just not for me. Its a very interesting and flexible show in terms of story.Its just about people and robots in a bizzaro world.Its basically our reality while we aren't in it.\nWe can't do anything but accept the lies and tyranny.Verdict: Watch it if you want. Its just not for me."]
