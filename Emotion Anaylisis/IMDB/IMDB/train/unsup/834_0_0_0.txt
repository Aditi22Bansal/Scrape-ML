['I gave this a chance until the second season when the slow moving action just ground to a halt midway through the season. The story seems to wander about aimlessly, flailing around to try and stop it from drowning. Each episode just seemed to be more and more like a theme park or elaborate costume set but without a very substantive story. I just could not connect with the characters like I did with "The Sopranos" where the characters really drew you into their story. In this series, the characters were like figures from history where you knew the names but they had no flesh to them at all. This, coupled with the slow moving story just lead to a complete loss of interest in the characters and the story. Steve Buscemi\'s portrayal did not fit the character at all, instead coming across like a caricature. He did not seem able to move through the range of emotions that would bring depth and credibility to the character. I think this series was hyped way beyond it\'s reality!']
