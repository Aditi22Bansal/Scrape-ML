['Since its debut last year, Netflix\'s "Stranger Things" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will\'s disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there\'s the contrast between Will\'s family and Mike\'s family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn\'t disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will\'s distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her "cute" roles, then you\'re in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.And remember, the bad men are coming.*I understand that the show\'s creators tracked down the makers of the era\'s board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries.']
