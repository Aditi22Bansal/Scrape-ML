["The Last Kingdom is a compelling, if somewhat confusing, historical drama. The key character Uhtred is a man caught between worlds. A Saxon raised as a Viking, who then returns to his Saxon roots. What I find confusing is why does he stay? The Saxons treat him like dirt, whilst he has an open offer to join the loyal son of his dead Viking father. I can see why the dynamic has been set up this way but perhaps, like others, I'm wondering when Uhtred will see the light and change sides. The acting in this series is excellent. Indeed, aside from a few inconsistencies in the plot, this series is a polished affair in all respects. Eight out of ten from me."]
