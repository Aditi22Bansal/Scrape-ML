["Smallville didn't create anything when it was on air. When Arrow came to the scene all the other shows followed because of its success.Smallville was a good show nevertheless. Its a superman show. We've seen it all already.The acting is alright and the story is what we've seen many times. I have nothing bad or great to say about it. It had a great run tho.Verdict: Watch and enjoy."]
