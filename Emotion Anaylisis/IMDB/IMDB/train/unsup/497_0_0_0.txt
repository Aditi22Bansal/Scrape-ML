['I don\'t need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don\'t know already that if you go to "talk" to the investigators that you don\'t just say "I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer". And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent.']
