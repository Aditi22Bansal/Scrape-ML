['It seems only a jerk can make "good" television.House was a total jerk, A-Hole and villain of this show. He treats people like garbage and people love it.Do the same in real life and Karen would have you fired, arrested and have your comments removed from social media.This show glorifies A-holeness which is why in 2020 you people are in the condition you are in.\nI also hate the poster. It\'s so silly with some guy sticking out his tongue. Why? That\'s gross.Verdict: I don\'t like House as a character. Complete turn off for a main protagonist.']
