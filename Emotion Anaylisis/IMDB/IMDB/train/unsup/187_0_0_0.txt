['What makes us "human"? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he\'s a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially "bro" Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It\'s really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren\'t there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn\'t he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain\'t. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it']
