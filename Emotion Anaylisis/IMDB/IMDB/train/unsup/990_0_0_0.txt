['Ray Donovan (perhaps with not the best choice of title) is another fine example of recent trend when crime series have become more interesting and meatier than crime movies. Lots of acclaimed actors, intertwining characters and events, and twisted twists make such series interesting to follow - but, for the sake of full comprehension, you should have time and opportunity to watch all episodes in succession. All this applies to the series in question, where the cast is evenly strong (well, Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan and Liev Schreiber as Raymond "Ray" Donovan stick out still), and the situations and relations get complicated a lot, without becoming airy-fairy, and the nature of Ray\'s duties and his big family enable to deal with dozens of different mini-scenes. Perhaps too much for some, but I personally liked to follow what happened in different places at the same time. Moreover, in many situations, I could ponder on and over complex issues, how/if I could resolve such a situation, and have some sympathy with characters even when the situation was unpleasant or even rude...Good job, and I am looking for the next season already.']
