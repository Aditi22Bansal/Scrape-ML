['This was a very good animated series. At first, one could think that it is something like "Ben 10" (Read: an American cartoon that tries too hard to imitate the visual style and characterization from anime series) but I ended liking this series. The animation is nice and detailed, the characters are interesting and have a great development while the plot advances, the storyline is complex and very well made, full of action, drama, comedy and mystery. Many of the elements of the story seem to be influenced by the mythology of China and India, and the result is simply incredible. The writers managed very well to keep the plot interesting, from the very beginning until the end. "Avatar: The Last Airbender" is one of the best cartoons ever produced by Nickelodeon, along with "Invader Zim", "Rocko" and "Ren & Stimpy" (Despite being completely different to those series) I highly recommend to anyone.10/10']
