["I am incredibly impressed with this show and love the fact that it is not your typical lawyer drama. When I first heard of this show I heard good things but the ad just did not do it justice. I wasn't expecting much but from the very first episode I was hooked. The writing is incredibly smart and witty and it feels like the cool organisation in the real world. Some shows you roll your eyes at how absurd it is but the outrageous things in Suits feel completely plausible.There is definitely room to improve and develop on the storyline and I think they have the ability to do this. I will be continuing to watch this show for a while to come and think it will just get better and better."]
