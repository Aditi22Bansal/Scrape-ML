['In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. "Interstellar" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Interestelar" ("Interstellar")']
