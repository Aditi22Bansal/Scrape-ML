["Excellent film depicting the Atlantic City area during the beginning of Prohibition in 1920.Am wondering if Steve Buscemi will be up to playing suave gangster Nukki Thompson in this series.It appears that director Martin Scorsese and others associated with this production have all totally captured the period. The set decorations seem to be excellent.We see that Nukki can actually have a heart in his treatment of Mrs. Schroeder, of course the fact that he has had Mr. Schroeder killed is something else.The film is very interesting in that it takes us to the beginnings of the illustrious careers of Arnold Rothstein and Al Capone.Corruption is wide-spread throughout Atlantic City. Even Thompson addresses a meeting of the Lady's Temperance Society at the film's beginning.As this part ends, we see the linking of Atlantic City to Chicago for violating the Volstead Act. The film is immediately showing that the latter act was so much more trouble than what it was worth."]
