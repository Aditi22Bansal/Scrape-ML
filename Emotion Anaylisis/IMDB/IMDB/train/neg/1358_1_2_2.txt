['The first thing I want to write is - unless you watched and enjoyed the prior "Bill and Ted" movies then you really ought to skip this one. While it is silly and juvenile it is done in such a winning manner that it is totally enjoyable.The first "Bill and Ted" movie came out in 1989 when the two were in their 20s but acting like high schoolers. Now mature in their 50s they each have a 20-something child, daughters, who identify with their dads and get into the time travel mode to help save the world yet again.I enjoyed it, on DVD from my public library. My wife skipped, as I suspected she would.']
