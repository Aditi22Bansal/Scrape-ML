['The 4th in the series of reimagined monsterverse movies finally sees Kong and Godzilla brought together. In the mythology of this series they are both on our side, kinda, as "Titans", avatars of worldwideworthness, but they are also huge rivals. In particular, Big G can sense Kong leaving Skull Island: apparently he needs to go home to get an upgrade, and home is apparently the hollow centre of the Earth. We also have a number of human factions, all of whom have their own agendas.There is quite a lot of apparent plot here, but much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. However, it is nicely played by a good cast (no Nick Fury, Captain Marvel or Loki, but we do have the lady baddie from Iron Man 3). There is also a great deal of utter, utter nonsense: Florida to Hong Kong by secret high speed underground tube travel in what appears to be 10 minutes, anyone?But, of course, this is all about a pair of 400 foot tall antagonists beating the snot out of each other, and that is there in abundance. Hong Kong will never be the same. And, unlike the first in this series, you can actually see what\'s going on.It really is the most ludicrous tosh but, even while I was shaking my head at how preposterous it was, there were times when I felt like cheering.This is hugely enjoyable big-budget trash cinema.']
