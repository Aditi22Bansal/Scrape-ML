['This film start with a man "Palmer" riding a bus, and he back to his grandmother house scene! As turnout, this film is about an ex-convict "Palmer" need to adopt a boy "Sam" from his drug addict mom "Shelly"! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the playing with doll scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the brushing teeth scene, and overuse of the watching TV scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Palmer beating up Daryl! At the end, Palmer adopted Sam! Sam receive a certificate from "Penelope\'s Flying Princess Club"! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!']
