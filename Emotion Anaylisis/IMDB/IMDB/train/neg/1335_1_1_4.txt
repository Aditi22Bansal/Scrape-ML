["I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It takes place entirely in the Mariana Trench, almost 7 miles deep and with water pressures of over 15,000 psi. Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment. I replayed a couple of scenes with only my TV speakers on and all the great sound disappeared. It is a dramatic difference."]
