['There is no real relationship, no depth of backstory on the characters. However, it is well photographed - in other words it doesn\'t look like the cheap porn movies they were making in "Boogie Nights", which was a first class film about the porn industry. This is just a soft core porn biology lesson, plain and simple. Another movie in a similar vein was "The Lover", which was was much better done than this. Sure, "The Lover" had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn\'t read the book, so I can\'t speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can\'t imagine how the book could have been a success. Avoid and don\'t waste your time.']
