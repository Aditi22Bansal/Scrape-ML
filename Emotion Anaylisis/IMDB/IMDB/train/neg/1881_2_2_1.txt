['This film is about James T. Kirk and his heroic rise to become the captain of USS Enterprise."Star Trek" has great special effects which are stunningly real. It also has a tight and thrilling plot, which ensures some calamity happening once every ten minutes. The soundtrack is also very good, as it really enhances the suspense and thrill of the scenes, making viewers even more engaged to what was already engaging. To me, despite these positive points, I still find the plot confusing and very difficult to understand. I have more questions than answers after watching "Star Trek". Maybe it\'s because this is the first Star Trek film I have ever watched.']
