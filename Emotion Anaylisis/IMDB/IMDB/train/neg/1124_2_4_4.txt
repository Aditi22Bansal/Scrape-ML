['Ok, so I\'m not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le Carr√©-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it\'s the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke\'s film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in "Penkovsky" (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn\'t up to holding together. It doesn\'t need a big screen, and will make for an adequate late night thriller on the telly, but unfortunately it offered little more.']
