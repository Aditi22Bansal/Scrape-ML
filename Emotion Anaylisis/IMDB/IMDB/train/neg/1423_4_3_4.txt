['The Call was a fine Korean thriller that had some very good concept and idea but i felt also like that idea could be explored and used in a little better ways then it was.Characters were little uninteresting to and i wasnt able to connect with them but they had some fine conversations over phone in beginning when they were more friendly and towards middle when staff started to change a bit and film turned into a horror.Story was like i said very unique and cool and im not sure if we ever seen something similiar on paper ,but execution was to messy to make it work']
