['This is an awful film with a single message to glorify Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan. We are used to the poor quality of the Turkish movies but this particular one is probably the worst ever, not worth watching unless you want to subject yourself the most excruciating political torment of admiring him at any expense. I wish there were an option of rating it zero star.']
