['"Defending Jacob", William Landay\'s 2012 based hit novel, is latest Apple TV series which is a slow crime drama. Thanks to the attempts to tell it over eight long episodes, the show feels slow and overstretched. As a result, dramatic tension and mystery elements are diluted, while the script needs more seasoning. Basically, there is a just few details that are explored and miniseries probably could have been just 90-120 minutes film. Ultimately, it is not the hit that Apple TV+ needs to be able to compete with major streaming services like Netflix.Rating: 6-/5+']
