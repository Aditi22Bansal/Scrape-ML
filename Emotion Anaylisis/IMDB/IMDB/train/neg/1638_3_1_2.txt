["Some might find the level of cruelty displayed in this movie unrealistic even for a story about a genocide but historical records prove that deep indoctrination and conditioning is in fact capable of completely desensitizing human beings and turn them into cold killing machines.The main virtue of this movie is exactly that.That other than momentarily expressed nervous reflexes there is absolutely no hesitation, no remorse, no empathy displayed by the personnel running the camp.The lesson/warning/message : a process like this doesn't run its course overnight, let's all be vigilant and recognize the signs of something like this about to take place and stop it before it's too late."]
