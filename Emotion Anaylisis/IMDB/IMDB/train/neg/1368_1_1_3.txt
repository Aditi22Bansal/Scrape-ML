["My ratings are not objective. This movie is objectively fine. My ratings are subjective opinions. My opinion is this is one of the most boring movies ever.There is about 30 minutes worth of story in this 2 hour movie. Say another 30 minutes for character development. The rest is nothingness. I almost quit a bunch of times. I watched it on fast speed, at most 2x during scenes with talking. But other times i had it at 5x speed and didn't miss a thing. That's how nothing this movie is.
