['The former policeman Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by the War Boys tribe, commanded by the Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and assigned to be blood donor for the Wat Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) that is sick. Meanwhile Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives a tank truck to collect gasoline for Joe. However her truly intention is to flee from the tyrannic Joe with his five women selected to breed hidden in the truck to her homeland. Immortal Joe commands a party to hunt down Furiosa and Max is chained to Nux\'s car. Furiosa heads the truck to a sand storm but Nux continues to pursuit her. After the storm, Max succeeds to release from the car and brings Nux chained with him. He sees Furiosa and the five wives and decides to flee in their truck; but there is a secret to operate the truck and he teams up with Furiosa, leaving Nux on the desert. When Joe\'s gang arrives, they retrieve Nux and follow Furiosa. Will Max and she succeed to escape from Joe\'s gang? "Mad Max: Fury Road" is a terrible and overrated sequel of the franchise "Mad Max" from the late 70\'s and 80\'s. The plot and characters are poorly developed and despite the action, the movie is totally forgettable. Tom Hardy is not charismatic and cannot be compared to the ironic Mel Gibson. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Mad Max: Estrada da FÃºria" ("Mad Max: Fury Road")']
