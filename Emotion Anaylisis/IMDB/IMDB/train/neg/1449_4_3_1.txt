["5 people arrive by seaplane to pursue 4 fantasies on Fantasy Island, under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke. The fantasies all seem relatively straightforward - one wants to be a hero soldier like his late father, one wants to correct the worst mistake she ever made, two brothers just want to have a hedonistic millionaires fun weekend, and one wants revenge on a school bully. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the opening sequence where a terrified woman is chased and caught is a clue, as is the fact that the UK Censor's card reveals that the film's full title is Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, Blumhouse being a horror production house.So,the old TV series reimagined as a horror. It's not a bad idea, and the 4 tales here (and the wider story they become part of) are nicely contrived and ravelled together.The cast is decent, with Michael Pena doing well as Mr Roarke. The production values all show on screen, and the film resolves well, with a very welcome kicker at the very end.This was pretty good."]
