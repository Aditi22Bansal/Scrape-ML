['The only thing that comes to mind watching this debacle Is Kate Bosworth, the one recognizable actress in this B-ensamble. I remembered I couldnt stop gazing at her beautiful face and charisma In Blue Crush.\nThat was many many years ago. I loved that movie growing up. Were exactly the same age. Now she Finally revisit the beach life and maybe this time the Magic of Kate would come back.. after many many years of failed b-movies i truly hoped for a return.\nBut no..\nIncredible boring miniserie without any feelings or direction.']
