['* Driving with no seat belt before the crash\n* Then when they crashed, he unbuckles his seat belt\n* The Bee couple walking towards the main character before he is put in the boot of a car by a lady, then asked whether anyone has seen a "black man wanted by the police" The Bee couple then run away to carry on looking\n* How someone with a gun shot in the arm can get around this much and put a shirt on with ease is amazing.']
