["If your willing to take a part viewing the world in different angle from a car seat then do it. if you are willing to torture your already exhausted brain then do it. if your willing to enter a metaphysical to be or not to be philosophical journey into nothingness then do it. if you are used to fall asleep when driving your car longer the 2 hours then dont.this film is for the feinschmaecker intelligencia, made for the stern and cultural reviewers to tear to pieces and then put it all together again in the eternal search of,'' what was this all about''??i give it a five for the acting and a very diverse filmography, the sound of music do leave a sense of cold uncertainty, and the rest were far too haiflaiing for the grumpy old man. its not a rewind."]
