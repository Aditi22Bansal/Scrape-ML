['So I did not research the couple that is depicted here, but it always sounds better if you say that something is based on something real and true. This is pure horror but it still was a nice double bill with A Quiet Place 2 at the Festival I saw them the other day - so good to be back in cinemas. Now you may think that that may have swayed me to give this a bit of a higher/better rating that you would have given it ... maybe, but then again I am known for being nice to movies most of the time, than the other way around.Now I would say that you do not need to know the other movies to enjoy this. But of course if you do know your Conjuring-verse you will recognize certain things and have some fun with it. Just when Annabelle is mentioned for example ... but apart from those "funny" moments, you also have some genuine comedy in it. Let that not fool you ... because it also has a lot of scary moments ... and while you will probably be able to know where this is going, it still is very well told ... with a very tender and romantic moment towards the end, that made the audience go "awww" ... yes even horror can do that.']
