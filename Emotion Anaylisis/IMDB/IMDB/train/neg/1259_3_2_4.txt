['2 out of 5 stars.Jolt is a bad action comedy film. Lacks the humor and comedic moments. Filled with cheesy direction that tries to keep the energy electric pacing. Plot about a girl Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) who has an impulse rage control which she uses an electric device to keep her anger down. When she finds a guy she may love. And something happens. She goes on a revenge spree to find the bad guys responsible.Plot is thin. And forgettable. A twist that may be predictable and lacks the surprises. Except for a fun surprise cameo of who shows up at the end.The action sequences are forgettable. And dull fight scenes with a fast editing scenes put together. Boring music score and dull direction.Kate Beckinsale is great but her talent is wasted in this action role.']
