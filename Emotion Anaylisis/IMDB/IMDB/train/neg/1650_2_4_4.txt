["Radhe was perhaps the worst decision to watch! The movie is a plain story with no turns or twist and just hyper elevate Salman Khan in a failed attempt\nIn most part of the movie, dialogues of Salman's other movies are used with additions of few more punch lines but it makes so much irritation to watch!This movie makes utter flop on box office on OTT."]
