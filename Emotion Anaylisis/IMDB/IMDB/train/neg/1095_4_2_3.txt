["I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 2/5\nComedy 0/5"]
