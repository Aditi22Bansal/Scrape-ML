['The film opens hinting at gremlins as Maude Garrett (Chloë Grace Moretz) forges her way on board an airplane at Aukland Air Base, NZ in 1943. She has a package that is classified and can not be opened and must remain up right. She ends up riding in the lower turret where it is cold and has a gremlin. For the first 52 minutes the film consists of Chloë Grace Moretz talking to the vulgar crew on the radio. This was the good part. Then the film becomes over the top (without William Shatner) as if Asylum was making the film using a lot of very bad green screen. They completely ruined the film. Holding on with one finger?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
