['. . . American Life, then you owe it to yourself to see Universal\'s NOBODY. Whether it\'s the White House, the U. S. Capitol or your own living room, title character Hutch learns here that the tentacles of the Russian oligarchical cancer is probing every nook and granny of our U. S. Homeland with virtual impunity. Anyone who takes umbrage at these outrageous assaults is subjected to sudden kidnapping, sadistic beatings and even horrible death, NOBODY reveals. But this flick updates that old gangster dictum ("Three in the head leaves them dead") with a new and improved motto for fighters of the Red Communist KGB: "Three heads with one shot really saves on bullets." Now that Major League Baseball has been forced to rescue its All-Star Game from the Kremlin\'s malignant voter suppression hotbed, NOBODY suggests that Coke, Dr. Pepper and CNN must swiftly follow suit. As Hutch would say, everybody should boycott peaches and peanut products, too, until Russia gets its crooked nose out of America\'s business!']
