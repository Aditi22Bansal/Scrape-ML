["The gang receives a transmission with Mr. Nobody. He had captured Cipher but the plane has crashed. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reluctant to go on another mission and risk his family but Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) convinces him. There is a MacGuffin and Dom's newly revealed brother Jakob (John Cena). Family...The full title is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It's a bit of an insult to tag your movie In Space. Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point."]
