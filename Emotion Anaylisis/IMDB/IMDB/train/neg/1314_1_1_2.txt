["I tried to watch it all the way through, but I got the gist of it within ten minutes. The story is lacking any sort of purpose other than blood and gore. The characters are flat, undeveloped and with no direction. This is basically a copy cat movie of all those other movies where you have either an elevator, island, a boat or a building with infected people getting killed off one at a time. It's completely predictable and boring."]
