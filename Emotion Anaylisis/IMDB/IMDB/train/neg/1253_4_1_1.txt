['I\'ve recently been watching Roald Dahl\'s "Tales of the Unexpected" and thought this would be along similar lines, but it turned out to be more a movie for kids. I even turned to my wife as the witch coven began blowing up and turning into rodents stating, can you believe we\'re watching this? This while our twelve year old granddaughter sits on a laptop with her Roblox; I would have had her watch this with us to get her take on it. The picture is mildly entertaining, though I will say the direction given Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch left a lot to be desired. She was just too irritating, although that was probably the point. Now that you\'ve got my mild warning, I\'d advise you to haul a couple of kids into the room to watch this with you, as it would probably make the experience more enjoyable. I did like the comforting advice offered by Octavia Spencer\'s character, the old Grandma in the story, when near the end she stated to her three little mice - "Never give up what you are inside". But I don\'t know if it was a good idea to leave her grandson and friends as tiny rodents. What kind of message is that?']
