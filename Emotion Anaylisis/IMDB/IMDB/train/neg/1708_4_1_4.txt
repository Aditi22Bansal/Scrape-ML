['"The story is invariably the sort of video-gamey, pop-corn, destroying-extraterrestrial-creature nonsense, the name "Project Starfish" is a dead giveaway of its arch-villain, but Gunn\'s script swiftly throw barbs towards USA government\'s aggressive foreign policy, hypocrisy, callousness and backdoor skulduggery, its patriotism is tainted by a mean streak that trivializes another country\'s human life. It is quite chilling to see Bloodsport and Peacemaker have a grisly killing competition then realize the rebel armies they massacred are actually allies, but there is no consequences, as long as they share the same enemy. Then, as the last resort, it is the puissance of the have-nots, the multitude, symbolically denoted by teeming rodents, that save the day, THE SUICIDE SQUAD is nothing if not politically perceptive."read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.']
