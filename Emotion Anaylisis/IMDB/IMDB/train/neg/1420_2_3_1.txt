["Surprisingly good even for the overcooked zombie genre. Zombies were numerous; nicely cosmetically zombized with well chosen stunt zombies for expressions & contortions. Additional fight scenes between boring humans added spice to zombie meal. Car chase & zombie mowing added a nice flavorful topping to this movie meal. A few plot twists to keep us guessing. All with some, perhaps humorously, unlikely characterizations. CGI not the best, but good enough unless you're a picky eater."]
