['James Hansen (Liam Neeson) owns a ranch in Neco, Arizona on the border. He hasn\'t made any payments in six months and is surprised when the bank forecloses. The cartel is chasing a mother and child across the border and we all know the script from here.It seems all Liam Neeson films are anti-climatic since "Taken." I would think at some point if you are a cartel, you just cut your losses.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity']
