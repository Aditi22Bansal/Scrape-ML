["I love Scooby-doo but this film was a boring silly superhero movie, it started off fairly good but then went over the top & so much happens that you can tell it's the starter for a Hannah Barbara Connected Universe as we meet lots of their characters & too much silliness happens & nothing is funny or even memorable at all!!!! Really a wasted opportunity to bring our beloved Mystery Gang back but here we hardly spend any time with them as it focuses more on Mark Whailberg's Blue Falcon superhero who is so bland & boring too!!!!\nA really silly childish & very boring kids flick that may entertain very little kids but not long time fans & we get a really weird & really un-funny & un-clever part for Simon Cowell??????? Maybe funny about 12 yrs ago but is embarrassing here & so out of place but all that said it is nice & colourful & harmless fun for little"]
