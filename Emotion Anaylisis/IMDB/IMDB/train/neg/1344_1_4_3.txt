['(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Croods is a pretty fair family adventure film. Following the Croods next adventure as they are trying to find there forever tomorrow home which they call it. But when they come across a giant walled utopia. With food everywhere. And an oasis river. They run into another family that calls themselves the Bettermans family. Which they know Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) family before they passed away. The Bettermans try to have Guy fall for there daughter while Grug (Nicholas Cage) makes a deal with them since he is disliking the idea his daughter Eve wants to start a life with Guy. While the Bettermans are holding a secret about there perfect home.The plot is pretty decent. The Croods are living a different lifestyle with the Bettermans. While they are trying to handle the Croods lifestyle. Grug is having trouble letting go his daughter is growing up. The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good. The direction with Croods mother and Eve and grandmother teaming with Bettermans mother and daughter to go save the guys was a little cheesy as it tries for that punk rock star tone. The humor is fun. The animation is colorful. And plenty of adventurous action.']
