['If you\'re familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of "Thirtysomething", "My So-Called Life", "Relativity", and "Once and Again", you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That\'s the case with this movie that they\'re also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who\'s always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I\'ll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film\'s story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?']
