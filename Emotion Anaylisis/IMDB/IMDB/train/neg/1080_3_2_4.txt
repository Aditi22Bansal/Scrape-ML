["The first question that came to mind was which Escape Room is the a sequel to? That is answered in the opening scenes as they replay part of the first feature. We are expected to know Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) from the first film. They are captured along with other champions who we don't know and are forced back into the game of frantic people screaming and attempting to figure out puzzles in a minute or so. I was not as impressed with this film as the original.Guide: No sex or nudity. Two softly spoken F-words."]
