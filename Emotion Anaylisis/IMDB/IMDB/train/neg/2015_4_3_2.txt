['I don\'t think the movie is as great as the ratings show. But it is still pretty original and entertaining. I just feel it wasn\'t developed enough and a lot could have been done better. I think the acting was really good. And it did a great job developing the paranoia in the beginning, it just went downhill when we were supposed to find out what happened.I don\'t think the movie is "racist". People whining about it are just as bad as SJWs who see racism everywhere.']
