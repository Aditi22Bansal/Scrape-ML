['Back in March 2020 of the votes here on IMDb for this movie, a bit over 25% are "1" votes from immature viewers. Now in August 2020 that has gone down a bit under 20% as wiser viewers add reasonable ratings. If you ignore the bogus "1" votes and look at the distribution of other votes, the greatest number are "6" with "5" as a close second. So "5.5" is probably the best rating, which is exactly in the middle of a 1 to 10 point rating system. In other words an "average" movie.While this movie isn\'t great in the grand scheme of things it is pretty well made and entertaining. There are several surprises along the way, many crosses and double crosses. You get to where you don\'t really know who the good guys are. It is girl-centered, there is nothing wrong with that.I am a long-time Charlie\'s Angel fan, back to the original TV days. While this version is quite a deviation from the original concept it is interesting to see what they did. I\'d more likely say "inspired by" Charlie\'s Angels with elements of James Bond and Jason Bourne thrown in.Good entertaining movie. My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. It has a great soundtrack, both in music and sound effects, you need a sound system with a good powered subwoofer to appreciate all of it.']
