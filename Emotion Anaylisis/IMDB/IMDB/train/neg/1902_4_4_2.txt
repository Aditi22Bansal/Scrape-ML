["More so than with the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield takes on the Spider-Man character, it appears that the Tom Holland version is geared more toward a teen and young adult audience. Nothing wrong with that, because alter-ego Peter Parker is a teenager himself. But it just doesn't feel like a super-hero movie for me with all the high school kids running around and Spider-Man trying to get out of a world threatening assignment from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever. As a completist I'll be on board for future movies, though I'd like to see more in the way of character development and effective story telling. A little bit darker tone would also be of help."]
