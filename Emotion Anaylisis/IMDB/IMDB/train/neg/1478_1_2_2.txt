['Everything that we\'ve ever seen in romantic comedies featuring protagonists who hit it off as friends-(with-non-sexual)-benefits and later fall in love (aw!), is packaged in the form of a perfunctory cliche in \'Holidate\'. The film is so by-the-numbers that you can keep your eyes closed, randomly name the leads X & Y, and it\'d all end up exactly the way you expect. No real surprises in the screenplay (by Tiffany Paulsen) - it\'s a ragbag of "I\'ve-seen-that-before"s, oozing cheese and gloss. The leads, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey, look great but they play stock characters that only appear in dreary, easy-on-the-brain rom-coms. The humor is the biggest letdown here: the only time I even chuckled was when a mother of two explains who a wh*re is, to her kids.']
