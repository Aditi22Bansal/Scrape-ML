['"I Care a Lot" is a Comedy - Crime movie in which we watch a woman working as legal guardian and taking advantage of elderly people to drain their savings. A lot change when she does the same to another elderly woman but she is more than she appears.I liked this movie because it was different, it had an interesting plot and some good interpretations. The only thing I did not like it was the way the plot was presented and how it was changing through the whole duration of the movie. At first I though that it would be a crime, thriller movie but after some time I understood that it\'s a comedy. The interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Marla Grayson was simply amazing. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Peter Dinklage\'s who played as Roman Lunyov and Dianne Wiest\'s who played as Jennifer Peterson. To sum up, I have to say that "I Care a Lot" is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but do not expect much otherwise you will be disappointed.']
