["First I want to say how great this state-of-the-art animation is. As my wife commented early in the movie, it's hard to believe that is animation. The effects, the facial expressions, everything. Second it took over 900 people working in over 400 homes during the worldwide pandemic to pool their talents to make this movie. Quite an achievement.But all that wouldn't matter if the story were blah. It in fact is a cool story in a fictional Asian world where some time earlier a menacing force turned many people and even dragons into stone. However it turns out one dragon remains and together with the young heroine they seek to reunite the several fractured factions of people to reclaim their former peace and cooperation.We enjoyed it at home on BluRay from our public library."]
