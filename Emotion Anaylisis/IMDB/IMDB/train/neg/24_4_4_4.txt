["The first few episodes weren't bad apart from Kidman's immobilized face which really affects her emotions which are now all the same. Unfortunately, too many of her closeups are featured.Grant, on the other hand is all the worst for wear, weary and ancient and downright sleazy. She playing a psychologist, and he an oncologist, really pushes the disbelief metre way too high.But OK, some of the bit part actors are great, including the sons and the lover and her husband.But all sorts of problems with reality. For one the kids being questioned without a social worker present. For two the kids in court seeing the murdered women, one her son? Please.The last two episodes it truly falls apart and we are troped and cliched to death, with obligatory car chase, helicopters, bridge jumper. It was painful to watch, like they ran out of all idea and let Grant and Kidman loose on each other without intervention from the cops surrounding them. Puhleese.No big reveal, just a pitiful whimper.A complete waste of time.3/10"]
