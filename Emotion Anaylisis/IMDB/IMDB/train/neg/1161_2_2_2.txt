['I\'m not just talking about the Warner Bros. and HBO Max same day streaming and theatrical release schedule, either, or referencing the general avoidance of cinemas during the pandemic, although I do generally miss the bigger picture, although not so much in the case of "The Little Things." It having the uninspired quality of a 1990s lesser crime drama variation of "Seven" (1995) to it (indeed, it was originally written and appears to be set in that decade), I could imagine being satisfied waiting a few months to rent a VHS copy of it, or not seeing it at all. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there\'s a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It\'s a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting. The little things of this genre piece may be there, but there\'s no bigger picture to validate it.']
