['In 1982, Ridley Scott released "Blade Runner", based on Philip K. Dick\'s "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?". It had two focuses. One was the question of what makes us human, as the protagonist (Harrison Ford) starts to question his order to capture the renegade replicants. The other was the look at a dystopian future, as there\'s no connection to the natural world and the population gets bombarded by advertising everywhere.Now, "Incendies" and "Arrival" director Denis Villeneuve has released a sequel: "Blade Runner 2049". The sequel expands on the original\'s dystopian focus, as anyone with the economic means has departed the moribund planet. A new corporation has replaced the one from the original movie, and has continued making replicants. A new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is the protagonist here, but there\'s more than meets the eye.The visuals are impressive. I guess that my complaint is that the plot takes a long time to get going, and a lot of the movie is shots of the protagonist\'s face to the tune of music. Even so, I\'d say that the movie is worth seeing, if not as great as the original.']
