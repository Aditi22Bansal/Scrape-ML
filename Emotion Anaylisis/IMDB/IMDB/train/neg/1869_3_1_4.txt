["How do people who only watch this one entry feel about it? I reckon dissatisfied. Because the movie is only part of something bigger and tough to just judge on its own merits. Having said that, I personally feel it works as a standalone too - like a tv show that cuts off and leaves you out in the cold in the end - but was really good up to that point.In this case you have the choice to watch more and get a ... as some say fresh take on the slasher genre. Because while this kind of feels like a slasher movie ... it isn't. And you can tell early on, that there is more. It is only visual and it's a bit of a cheat (all things considering), but it does make sense - yes suspend your disbelief! You have to, no doubt about it.Another thing that there is no doubt about: you can't be squeamish! While there is nothing much here when it comes to nudity (and only a small amount of what could be called sexy time), there is a lot of blood and violence! As one should be expecting to see from a slasher ... on the violence scale that is. And just when you think you can sit back comfortably and relax .. the movie pulls you back in - quite literally working on the .. brain (pun very much intended)"]
