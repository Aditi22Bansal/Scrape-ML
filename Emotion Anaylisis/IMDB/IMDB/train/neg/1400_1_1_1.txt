['3 out of 5 stars.Oxygen is a fair science fiction thriller film about Liz (Melanie Laurent) who wakes up in a cryo pod with no memory. No idea how she got there. And a defective pod that is limited on oxygen. While she tries to discover how she got there. And how she can escape it.What worked? The plot is decent which tried to keep a mystery. It gives a brief backstory on Liz. And some brief moments of the events that is happening before she got in the pod. There is a twist which was pretty neat. And shocking.Melanie Laurent did a good job with her performance.The music score was okay. Its claustrophobic direction was good.What did not work?The film was short with where it went. Spending the whole movie in a cryo pod. Which did get boring after a while. And it did get slow which was being short on thrills.']
