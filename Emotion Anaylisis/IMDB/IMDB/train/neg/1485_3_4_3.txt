["An amateur and seasoned writer came up with a nonsense convoluted mess of a screenplay with plot and technical issues galore. I think this film lost it's way trying to be a mismash of a parody-action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above. Had it chosen one or two points of genre, it could've so been much better. Even the action was lackluster. The best part of this film was the soundtrack. Great to see an all star cast having fun though."]
