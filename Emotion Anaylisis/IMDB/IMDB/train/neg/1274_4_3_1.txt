['Greetings from Lithuania.The first mistake of "Host" (2020) i think that in its 56 min. length it was hardly possible to establish 4 or 5 characters at the same time. There was only a situation and jump scares - and that is it, that is the whole thing (I can\'t even call it a full feature film). In "Host" you get a premise as old as a Blair Witch herself. And we have seen all this stuff being done so many times, and in a so many better horror film. Even a first "Paranormal Activities" movie was a masterpiece in comparison with this one, because it took its time to establish situation and characters. Unfortunately "Host" doesn\'t have any of this. And there is also one dude Teddy i think was his name, who was so obnoxious that i was pretty happy when he was out of the picture at the end so to speak - literally.Overall, "Host" isn\'t a terrible movie, and you can see an attempt to make something good on a very low budget and premise. That is not a bad thing, if its done right. But in 56 min. you only get bunch of jump scare scenes with some faces on a laptops. This is what "Host" basically is.']
