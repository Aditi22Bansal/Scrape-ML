["As a massive fan of South Korean cinema I was looking forward to this one and tried really hard to like it, but in the end it does come across as very bland. I'm not sure if Netflix trod on the Koreans and forced them to make this accessible to an international audience but it feels extremely generic and lightweight, like a carbon copy of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or something. I watch Korean stuff to see Korean style and the usual quirkiness, not something that could have been churned out on a production line by Hollywood. Sure, the characters are likeable enough, but the rescue story is extremely basic and doesn't sustain the near two and a half hour running time, so this feels like it goes on forever. The CGI effects are nondescript and the cheesiness becomes all too apparent as it goes on, particularly in the ridiculous ending. Not an awful film, but a disappointment given what Korea's usually capable of."]
