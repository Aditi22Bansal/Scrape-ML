["OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.So-so. The movie LOOKS good (the deserted vessel is impressive) but the story is slow and the characters are never fully realized. Also top billed Gabriel Byrne (giving a terrible performance) is hardly in the movie. On the plus side Julianna Margulies is good and a strong female character (unusual in any horror movie) and Alix Dimitriades and Ron Eldard are good as members of the crew. Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. But the slow pace and a predictable and stupid ending sinks this (sorry). I can only give this a 5."]
