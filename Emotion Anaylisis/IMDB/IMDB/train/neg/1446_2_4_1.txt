['"Fantasy Island" is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch five people arriving at a luxurious island where everything is possible. The owner and operator of the fantasy island states that every person has only one fantasy that can be made true so, each person decides its dream or fantasy and starts living it.I did not like the movie because it was boring and full of unnecessary plot twists which were predictable and made the movie even more boring. At first the theme was interesting but after half an hour everything change and became boring and predictable due to poorly execution. The direction which was made by Jeff Wadlow was not the best but I believe he did everything he could in order for it to become better, although nothing changed. Finally, I have to say that "Fantasy Island" is not a good movie for all the reasons I stated above and I believe that even if you do not have high expectations from it you will be disappointed and you will think that you wasted your time watching it.']
