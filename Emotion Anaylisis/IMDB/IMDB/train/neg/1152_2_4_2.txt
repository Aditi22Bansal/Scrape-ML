['Extreme unrealistic stereotyping of teaching styles & classroom student behavior. Came across as a promotional film for alcohol. Opening monologue of roughly, "We\'re born to have a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.05%; in other words born with a deficit of 0.05%, (1-2 glasses a day) to maintain a happy state of mind; to increase social & professional teaching." Please!, they wouldn\'t last a week while imbibing before and/or during class time. Happy party scene at the end was pure dumb.']
