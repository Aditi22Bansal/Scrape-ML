["A group of friends set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. After getting lost they stumble across a sinister man in a strange outfit. This meeting will have a profound impact on their lives and see their lives threatened by a strange cult.The 2003 Wrong Turn was a surprisingly decent horror movie, with a reasonably good plot and good performances. The success of this film caused the producers to create five sequels, all of which were incredibly bad, being made for the money and falling back on the usual horror clich√©s and formulae.This film is essentially another one of those sequels, relying entirely on the Wrong Turn name without bringing anything original to the table. Quite dull and formulaic with a middle section that doesn't make too much sense.Avoid."]
