['First four episodes were good. Then it starts to drag. I didnt like Kerry Washington as Mia. Too unlikeable and that hairdo and robotic delivery. I thought the most interesting character was Izzy. Reese Witherspoon reprised a similar role from what she had in Big Little Lies. A series of eight episodes but it feels like sixteen. I didnt absorb the subplots and the Chinese actress was god awful. I didnt buy it.']
