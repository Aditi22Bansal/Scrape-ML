["Wow Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job in this role!! To be honest, almost all of the actors did. The only one who I had trouble watching was Kerry Washington - why does she always look like she's just stepped in dog poo or about to scream or cry?\nI enjoyed the show, some good drama and a few twists. I didn't love it though, especially the silly ending."]
