["You have to see this, the flick on flix, wow, what the hell was all that people were talking about. And by know I promised myself never to watch a trailer and go blind into a flick. As I did with this one.The only thing I heard that you needed to se eit for the effects used. And I agree, the effects used here and there are indeed way above mediocre but effects doesn't make a movie as we see here. The story I can dig but why o why does flicks have to clock in over 90 minutes nowadays.By now you do know I wans't into The Call. A lot of blah blah over the, sigh, phone and nothing really happening. Sure, there is blood here and there and some awkward situations with some devilsih doing but overall it was a let down for me. Hyped again by Netflix and by a lot of people on all social media, do not count me in.\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 3/5\nStory 2,5/5\nComedy 0/5"]
