["Great horror flick, well-made all around. Doesn't miss a beat as a continuation of the story as well as the tone and feel. Intense and suspenseful with some major tension. An awesome opening scene. Overall very enjoyable.It's hard for me to say which one is better. I think overall they are about the same. But this one had some scenes that were way better and made me think it could surpass the original. But there are other things i didn't like as much and didn't feel as natural. The original was a steadier 7 star movie, although there were some questionable parts in that one as well. (1 viewing, 5/27/2021)"]
