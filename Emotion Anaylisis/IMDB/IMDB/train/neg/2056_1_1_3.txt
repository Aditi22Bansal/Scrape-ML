["Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has."]
