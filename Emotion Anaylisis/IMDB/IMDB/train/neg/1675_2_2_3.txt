['RATED 6/10\nLanguage: Hindi\nSource: Amazon PrimeIf they advertised this as romance genre, may be they might have get more positive reviews...this is more of romance and less sports.If you exclude the exercising scenes, we can count the sports scenes...\nThe biggest problem in this sports movie is that villain... they didnt explain anything about villain other than ring commentaries...The villains are introduced at the ring only and their story ends in ring itself...\nI really enjoyed the first half of the movie... after marriage, the movie goes into run of the mill story and nothing special...']
