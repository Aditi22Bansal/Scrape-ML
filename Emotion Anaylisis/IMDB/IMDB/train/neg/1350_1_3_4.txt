['Andy (Charlize Theron) short for Andromeda, the Andromeda leads a group of near immortals on select missions to save lives and eat baklava. Andy says they don\'t do repeats, but if you watched "6 Underground" you know Netflix does. They go on a mission to Sudan for Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor ) which was a set-up. Copley suspects the groups power and want to turn them over to Merrick Pharma. Rather than approach them with a proposal, he opts to gun them all down and make up later. This scenario didn\'t make any sense at all.This looks like a two hour pilot for a series that promises to be better. And they have the ability to drop people out and bring new ones in.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
