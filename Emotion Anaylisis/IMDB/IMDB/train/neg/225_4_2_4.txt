["This review contains spoilers.The I-Land is a Netflix produced show that premiered in 2019. The series is about a group of death row inmates that find themselves in a simulation to redeem themselves.The I-Land Season OneThe I-Land's first season is an overall disaster. This season has many problems that were apparent in the first episode. The series has almost all unlikable characters. The only likable character was Moses as he is actually able to be a good person in the simulation. Even his crime was involuntary manslaughter as he did not want to cause harm to people. This character was killed off in an awful way with Cooper accidentally shooting Moses. The actor for this character aws also enjoyable to watch as he made the series more light-hearted. The other characters in this series are awfully antagonistic. The I-Land inhabitants do not seem to want to get along or even discover the mystery of why they are in the I-Land.The first season fails in telling a cohesive story. There are many inconsistencies across the entire series. One of these is K.C. having a stab wound on her that is continued into the I-Land. Cooper has facial scarring that is not carried into the I-Land. This inconsistency is never explained in the series.I would not recommend 'The I-Land'. The series has so bad it is good moments but these are not enough to make the series watchable.Grade: D"]
