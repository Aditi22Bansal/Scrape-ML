["Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki), her troubled brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her best friend Paige Edwards (Paris Hilton), Paige's boyfriend Blake and Dalton Chapman are on their way to a football game. They take a detour and decide to camp out for the night. A muddy truck interrupts them and Nick throws a bottle that bust one of the headlights. The next day, Wade's fan belt is cut. Carly discovers a pit of dead animals. Wade and Carly catch a ride from the roadkill driver. They find the town of Ambrose virtually deserted. Most of the small town is attending a funeral. Bo (Brian Van Holt) needs to finish the funeral before selling the fan belt. The couple decides to go into the closed House of Wax. Their friends are driving back after getting stuck in traffic.This thing starts pretty slow. It turns into a traditional slasher horror movie. The good news is that Paris Hilton gets killed. The wax figures are good creepy background. Elisha Cuthbert is a good scream queen and there is nothing wrong with a slasher movie where pretty young people get massacred."]
