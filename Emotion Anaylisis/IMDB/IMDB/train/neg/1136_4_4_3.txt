['Adam Sandler stars as the title character as he attempts to impersonate Bill Murray in "Caddy Shack." Not as good and not as funny. Hubie gets Steve Buscemi as a new neighbor which is scary in itself. Hubie is the picked on village idiot who tries to do good in the town of Salem at Halloween. It has word play "b*ner" jokes as the funniest aspect of the movie, to give you a clue. The cast includes a bunch of known names and Sandler uses his family in a way that would make Judd Apatow green with envy. Now that would have been funny having him in the film turning green watching Adam using his kids. It was wasted potential.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Just stupid jokes.']
