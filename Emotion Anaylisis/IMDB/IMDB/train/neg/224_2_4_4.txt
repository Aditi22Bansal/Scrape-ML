['The first episode was somewhat intriguing, the second less so and by episode 5 it was boring of the same stuff over and over again. A confusing change in episode 6 going into 7 where it eventually reached a conclusion and all was revealed. Not a good story but somewhat different.If you have nothing to do, perhaps it helps you pass the time, but by not watching it you have missed nothing! However, I cannot agree that it is terrible as most reviewers allege.']
