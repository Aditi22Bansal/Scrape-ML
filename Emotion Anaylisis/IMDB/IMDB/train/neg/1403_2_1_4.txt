['Avoid. Why? Because I felt uncomfortable, bored, confused, dumbfounded and in the end irritated. Who wants to feel that when watching a movie? You do? I do not.This movie is like almost all the other Charlie Kaufman movies: I do tend to feel incredibley UNcomfortable and confused and DEpressed and IRritated.
