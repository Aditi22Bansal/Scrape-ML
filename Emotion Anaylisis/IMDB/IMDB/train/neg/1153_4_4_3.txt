["This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood."]
