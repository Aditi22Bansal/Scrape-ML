['This movie has some really bad points. It isn\'t the worst action hero movie ever. It\'s 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.\nFirstly the bad points:\n1. The story. This silly "wish" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn\'t have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It\'s beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.\n2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.\nThe good points:\n1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.\n2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.\n3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.\n4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.\nThe cast is good but they can\'t save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.\n5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.']
