["This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."]
