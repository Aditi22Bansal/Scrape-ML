["While Old starts out with an intriguing story, the idea gets fatigued quickly and the film becomes a little absent-minded. I appreciate that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to tell original stories, but the characters in this movie didn't act or speak like normal people. It took forever for them to realize what was going on, and then they suddenly leapt to all sorts of conclusions. I prefer Shyamalan's other geriatric thriller, The Visit."]
