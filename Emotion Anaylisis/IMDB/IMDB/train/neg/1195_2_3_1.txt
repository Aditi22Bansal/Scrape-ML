['I\'ve never been there but a have a soft spot with any movie that\'s filmed in and around Pittsburgh, PA. I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows? The terrific location photography is the only part of "Sweet Girl" that\'s worth watching. It\'s a silly piece of propaganda aimed at an audience that\'s too old to care. The likeable cast ends up spinning their wheels in pretty bad material.']
