['This is what happens when you have a script for a porno and think "you know what? I bet if I make the sex scenes less explicit I can turn this into a theatrical movie", but you keep the awful dialogue and the disgusting kidnaping plot that was too tasteless for even the most desperate porn studios and expect no one to notice.Also, from a writing standpoint, what\'s the point of making it 365 days to fall in love with him if she\'s just gonna fall in love with him on like the third day? Couldn\'t they at least made it clearer how much time has passed, because half the time I have no idea if it\'s been week or five months. It does feel like a year, that\'s for sure.']
