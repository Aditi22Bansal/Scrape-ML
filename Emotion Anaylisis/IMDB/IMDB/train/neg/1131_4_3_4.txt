['This starts off really quite strongly. The Warren\'s - Ed (Patrick Wilson) and wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are brought in to conduct an exorcism upon a young boy but somewhere during the process, the spirit manages to swap bodies and the life of the boy\'s older friend Arne (Ruairi O\'Connor) starts to take on an unpredictable nature that culminates in him being charged for the murder of his friend - which we know he did. Was he possessed at the time of the crime? Well the Warren\'s decide that they are going to try and offer this as a form of defence and so they set about tracking down his demon and proving their point. It\'s from here on in that the thing falls away quite badly. John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don\'t really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn\'t scary in the slightest. Perhaps we are all becoming just too numb to the impact of visual effects to create menace? It is certainly becoming more difficult for a director to get those "jump" moments, especially with format horror like this. Sadly, truth isn\'t stranger than fiction any more and if the "Conjuring" is to continue, it will need quite a creative overhaul. This is worth a watch, but is pretty unremarkable.']
