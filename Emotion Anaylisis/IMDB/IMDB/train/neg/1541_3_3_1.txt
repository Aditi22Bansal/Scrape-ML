['Sadly, Poehler is perfect proof that just because someone has impeccable comic timing & style in front of the camera, that doesn\'t mean they can control it from behind the camera. This awkwardly directed & extremely predictable empowerment "comedy" will be meaningful to certain people, I have no doubt...especially young women. Unfortunately, the film\'s inability to choose a strong position about its protagonists (brave & important, or immature & silly?) makes it feel irresponsibly glib.']
