["Yes Day - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Instead of heartfelt realistic execution, the director went all Tiffany Haddish or Melissa McCarthy (in her husband's movies) on the idea. Unrealistic, loud and screaming or should I say screeching kids.Jennifer Garner was the only one kept me watching this till the end. She tried her best but the rest of the cast has no energy or charm to match her.The girl playing the eldest kid, Jenna Ortega's agent must be working extra hard getting her all The most Annoying Teen parts on Netflix. First in YOU season 2, then Babysitter 2 and now Yes Day. Playing same irritating hyped up kid who is too smart and grownup for her age etc etc. we get it, you got angst.Can't believe that a movie about hour and half can get soo tedious. Kids may enjoy but parents have to suffer."]
