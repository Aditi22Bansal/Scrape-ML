["The special-effects in this sci-fi techno are as wild as in the first film in this trilogy. However, I thought this was the least appealing of the three films. The action scenes were stupid and too repetitive (too much of the same kind of action.) Yet, to point out the good as well as the bad, the car chase was spectacular. The film also went on a bit too long. It would have been better with some of those action scenes lessened.I had heard the story was very poor, but I didn't find it that bad. However, there is too much technical talk. Who can understand half of the mumbo-jumbo espoused in here?"]
