['The world is split into five parts named after a dragon. It is in ruins and dying as druuns (purple Death Eaters) are turning people to stone. Princess Raya must play Tomb Raider to recover the gems and save the world. But first she must find the dragon. It won\'t be easy as no one wants to give up their piece of the gem.The film is only mildly Asian in tradition. The language is modern English slang. Raya\'s eyes are almost round. Sisu (the villain) has more slanted eyes. Doesn\'t Disney know to end the stereotype? The ending reminded me a little of "Guardians of the Galaxy" minus the dance off.']
