['Although the plot is intense and includes several twists and turns, the "post-crime" activities of the wrongdoer are rather odd - bearing in mind the personÂ´s background, knowledge and an opportunity presented. Being so sloppy after such a crime with subsequent mood change? Not too realistic... I wonder if the novel behind (You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz) is a total fiction?Still, due to the direction (highly valued Susanne Bier from Denmark) and magnificent performances of Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant, Noah Jupe, Donald Sutherland, and Noma Dumezweni, above all, all the episodes were still pleasant to follow, plus the final scenes were different from a regular US series. Kidman should be praised somehow for being Grace Fraser - although she is always a splendid actress.']
