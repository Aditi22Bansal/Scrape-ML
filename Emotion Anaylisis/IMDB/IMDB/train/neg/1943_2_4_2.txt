["It's very clear that the MCU was greatly influenced by the success of Deadpool. What do I mean by that? Well, Deadpool was largely a comedy with action or an action comedy (however you choose to define it) and it seems that Thor: Ragnarok followed the same mold (less the abundant profanity).The question is: did it work? Judging by the amount of laughter I heard in the packed theater... yes. As for myself... not so much. It was entertaining and I did chuckle a few times myself, but I could have sufficed with fewer laughs and a little more substance. I was not that impressed with the nemesis, Hela (Cate Blanchett), with no onus on Cate because she's great. Hela just wasn't an interesting enough or captivating enough foe. And while I have generally loved Hulk's roles in the two Avenger movies, he was too cartoonish in Thor: Ragnarok. I mean he was literally more cartoonish instead of the more lifelike look he had in the other movies and he was more cartoonish in his behavior.I love the crossovers that Marvel does now (adding other Marvel characters) and that does boost its overall enjoyment value. There were some added characters around Thor in this movie that was nice. But boiling the movie down to the story and the execution of that story, it was more ehh. It was still entertaining and a fun night at the movies but not MCU good."]
