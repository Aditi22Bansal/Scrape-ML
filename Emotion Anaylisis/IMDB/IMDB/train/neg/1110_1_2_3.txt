["I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view."]
