["It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist. He is determined to contact any off-planet travellers from Earth to warn them of the disaster and see if they can help. Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing."]
