['The story: cops who were corrupt get slaughtered by a serial killer. Can cop Chris Rock find the serial killer?The good: beautifully photographed.The bad: cheap violence cant cover up the fact that this movie is below average, at best. The supporting actors are mediocre, but worse, the 2 great actors Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson act below par as well. The dialogues and the story are simply boring and full of the usual cop cliches we have seen a zillion times before.More bad: there is no real suspense. There are no jokes either. The action / horror is cheap and only used to cover up that this movie is boring from start to finish.This movie is made without any soul or originality. The money to make a good movie was there, but the time and will was not.']
