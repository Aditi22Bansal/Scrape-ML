["This flick is just meant to be a light hearted screwball comedy and it certainly achieved that goal. The characters are indistructable as you will see during their life threatening escapades and they always come out like fresh roses.David Spade pulls off his subdued character 'Tim' perfectly. And Lauren Lapkus as 'Missy' is possitively creepy as Missy was supposed to be.A movie for 'fun to watch time', not a lmao time!"]
