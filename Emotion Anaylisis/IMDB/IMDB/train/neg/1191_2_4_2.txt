["Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll."]
