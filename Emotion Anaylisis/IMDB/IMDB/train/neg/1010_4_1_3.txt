['This film start with the news broadcasting about the fire, and the introduction of the main character "Joe" scene! As turnout, this film is about a police officer with murder record "Joe" need to act as a call operator to save a psychopathic woman "Emily"! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the shouting scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the using asthma spray scene, overuse of the watching map on the screen scene, overuse of the talking on the microphone scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, and overuse of the recording by writing scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after Joe solve Emily case, he talking about his court case at the bathroom! That\'s it! Completely wasting time to watch!']
