['This film start with a girl "Elle" talking about her boyfriend "Noah" left her to study, and she apply for the same university with her boyfriend\'s brother "Lee" scene! As turnout, this film is about Elle and Noah need to reconcile their relationship , after they mistaken both of them have affair with another person! Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, and overuse of the dancing on the dancing game machine scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Elle and Marco perform together at the dancing contest! At the end, Elle met Noah at the kissing booth and get back together! Elle have been accepted in both University Of California, and Harvard University application! Still have a series of bloopers scene alongside with the end credit scene! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!']
