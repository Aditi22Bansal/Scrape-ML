['An explosion near a train kills some passengers. Among the dead is a man who was going to testify against the bike gang, "Riders of Justice." A man who creates algorithms (ones that can tell us rich people drive Mercedes and poor people drive Kias) survived the blast and believes it could not be coincidental. He believes a man who exited the train had something to do with the blast. He involves a few other people, including military man Mads Mikkelsen who lost his wife in the explosion. They enact a plan of revenge.The film also looks at how things interact, how small unrelated events trigger larger ones. In this instance, an Estonian girl wanting a blue bicycle as opposed to a red one starts it all off. The group of characters are enjoyable and there are a number of light moments. I liked the ending.I watched the film with subtitles.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity. No sex.']
