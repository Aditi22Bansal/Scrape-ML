["The Courier is based on true events, the Cuban Missile Crisis to be more precise. It's an entertaining movie but don't expect too much action scenes as there are almost none. It's more a spy drama about an event that the whole world knows about. The cast did a good job playing their characters. I've never been a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I have to admit he can act. He just has one of those faces I don't really like but credits to him, he can act. The Courier is certainly worth a watch, especially if you like historical facts and spy movies about the Cold War."]
