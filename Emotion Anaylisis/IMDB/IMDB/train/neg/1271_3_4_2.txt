['What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, "6 Underground," "Ronin," and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let\'s break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it\'s all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer\'s kidnapped son. It\'s pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn\'t need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn\'t even ask the price. Some odd hours later he\'s in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. "Extraction" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It\'s a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.']
