["Based on a true story, Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes ) is hired by Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to do an archeological dig on some hills of dirt near her home. Edith is ill and has a son Robert who wants to help.If you read the by-line you know what they discover. They create a little drama around it. But hey, it is all about folks digging in dirt. I can't believe they did this film without Keira Knightley.Guide: Brief sex. No swearing or nudity."]
