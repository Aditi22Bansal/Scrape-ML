['This is a heist movie. For any heist movie, you\'re better off just re-watching "One Crew over the Crewcoo\'s Morty". The genre is formulaic by design, often involves a cast of very well known people and movies in it should be performance pieces. I mean, no one cares about the loot or what happens in the end, they just want to be entertained by the loops and twists of the story and the way actors make you care about their characters. And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It\'s not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was "inspired" from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean\'s N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can\'t recommend it yet I can\'t say it was a bad movie. It was just... uninteresting.']
