['Producers will blame the poor box office of "No Time to Die" on COVID but that\'s not why it\'s bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn\'t made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn\'t that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn\'t a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn\'t have even noticed the jokes. It\'s also about twenty minutes too long. "No Time to Die" bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig\'s not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.']
