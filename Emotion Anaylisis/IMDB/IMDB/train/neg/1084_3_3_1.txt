['This film start with a man "Rob" talking to his pig, and a people "Amir" arrive with his car scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of who kidnapped Rob\'s pig! We found out is Amir\'s father! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the calling names scene, and overuse of the preparing food scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after knowing his beloved pig already dead, Rob playing the cassette! That\'s it! Completely wasting time to watch!']
