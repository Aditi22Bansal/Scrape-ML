["The only good thing about this movie is that it had decent suspense and humour and acting was good enough.\nThough it's not unique as many movies like this have been made earlier, showing 3-4 guys and their stories and how their stories cross meet in between. They just added the ludo game concept in their stories to make it look different."]
