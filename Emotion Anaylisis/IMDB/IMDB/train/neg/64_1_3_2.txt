['If you liked the game which has more or less the same title, then please do yourself a favor and never ever watch this.\nIt starts out ok even if Ken\'s obvious wig is distracting to say the least. But it\'s like they ran out of money in the end...... Was there an end? Absolutely unsatisfying. Made no sense at all. And how about the rest of the characters. Were they too expensive?\nSuch a shame they made this wreck. And all the "wow this is the best ever" idiots should first play the game like I did.\nWaste of time.']
