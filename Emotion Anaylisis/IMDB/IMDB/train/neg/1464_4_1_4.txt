["The cinematography throughout this movie was quite beautiful, with the landscapes and the cgi on the animals. The characters were well acted and well scripted, but they had no depth. I didn't find myself very emotionally invested in the story. It was a decent movie in all aspects, it just wasn't too much of anything which left it a bit underwhelming."]
