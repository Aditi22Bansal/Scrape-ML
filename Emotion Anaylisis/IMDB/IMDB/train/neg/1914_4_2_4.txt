["Really enjoyable film some kind similar to saw(I originally prefer saw over this). Idea and plot was good had some mistakes but still decent movie. Didn't get why that boy fall in ice and die. Like he didn't have any chance to win? So basically that's kind of mistake. Ending was predictable and like meh nothing special. I would recommend this film for lazy weekend. As 2019 only begins this looks decent year."]
