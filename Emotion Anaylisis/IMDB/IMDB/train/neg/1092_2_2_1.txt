['Despite myself, I actually rather enjoyed this. Certainly the plot is pretty far-fetched, but once the film gets up a head of steam, it is quickly paced with some well placed jump scenes that work quite well. Stephen Lang is effective as the blind fella, trying to rescue his "daughter" from her long-lost family, and is especially so once we find out just quite why they are so keen on re-uniting. Madelyn Grace is also quite competent as the young girl "Phoenix" and I found Fiona O\'Shaughnessy\'s particularly odious "mother" character quite detestable too. Not great, no, but kills an hour and a half easily enough and reminds you to always honour your dog - or else!!']
