['I don\'t have anything specific i hated about this movie. It just didn\'t do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn\'t make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what\'s happening in a scene. I\'m not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn\'t know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious. And there is an "ah ha" moment that makes zero sense. To keep it vague, it\'s okay if a specific person dies. But logically, it wouldn\'t make any difference based on what they\'re trying to avoid (1 viewing, 8/8/2021)']
