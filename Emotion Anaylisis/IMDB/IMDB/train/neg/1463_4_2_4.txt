['One of the turn offs for this production is the pill. Watching some one have to not only swallow the pill, but turn it? then it makes a sound? And it looks like there is a tiny galaxy inside it? Talk about ruining the mood. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.There is nothing wrong with the acting, the casting is good, the cinematography too. The special effects are hit or miss, some are awesome, some are terrible. The script is off as well the directing.The idea of stealing some essence from a person and then using it to make "juice" to give temporary super powers is nothing new. Bad Boys for example, on Amazon already has this but it isn\'t in pill form. There are other stories with the same premise. So no kudos on originality.Other than this, it was worth a one time watch. However, this isn\'t going to win any awards. There is nothing special about this movie.']
