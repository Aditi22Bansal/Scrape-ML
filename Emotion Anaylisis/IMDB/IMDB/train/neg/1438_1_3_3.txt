["Load of fake accounts with reviews promoting this movie. Now with smarter fakes.This movie is really slow. It's mis-titled for starters. It should be called Sam, or Palmer and Sam, or The Crying Contest. Seriously, almost every character cries and wants the title.Overall this is a predictable story, troubled child and on and on, not much happens really, and the ending, well, just sort of ends. I guess that's what they call a movie these days.I like JT, but he's downright cringey in this in his multiple attempts to force himself to cry. 3 stars for his performance, not much else is good or worth watching. It's not realistic, multiple inconsistencies, and the fact that JT wants to take care of a kid he only knew for a few days, on a $60/day job, with no savings, and no where to live. Well, that's just rubbish."]
