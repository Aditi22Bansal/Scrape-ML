['Am from the area in question. The nastiness of the kinfolk is very nearly accurate; in real life they are much more venomous. Good portrayal of southern Missouri, with some flaws. Like, yanking every rock from a creek has nothing to do with superstition; it\'s the kinfolks\' message to the world, "the next body we\'uns dump won\'t git hungup in this crick." Stuff like that, an outsider can\'t fathom, but to a child of the kinfolk it would be plain as day. As dark and ugly and ignorant as Missoura.\nI will say one thing for sure, they did not exaggerate how creepy and weird Missouri is. They downplayed it. The people of "Missoura" are much creepier in real life. Fly over it. Edit: made the mistake of putting the second disk in. OMG the fact that anyone rates this above a 1 signifies everything wrong with humanity. The fact that Jillian Flynn gets published signifies everything wrong with humanity. Intolerably stupid and bad. Just BAD BAD BAD. The menacing satanic ugliness of small town USA should not be glorified like this.']
