["Jack Cunnigham (Ben Affleck) works construction and loves canned drinks, perhaps too much. He was a basketball player who has been asked to come back to high school and coach. We watch him swear at the kids and drink. He has anger and sorrow over a lost son and now a separated wife seeing a rich guy. The characters were not that great and we wait for the moment he realizes he has an alcohol problem and turns his life around. The event happens with 12 minutes of film left and doesn't do the film justice.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."]
