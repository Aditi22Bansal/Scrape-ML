["Somehow I have my doubts as to whether Diablo Cody's Oscar for Juno's screen play is going to be joined by one for Jennifer's Body. Where Juno was a breath of fresh air, Jennifer's Body is a cheerfully trashy and utterly familiar high school teen horror with a dash of comedy thrown in.Megan Fox is, of course, the main attraction. She gets to say some raunchy dialogue and to tease the male element of the audience as much as some of her victims. But I haven't yet seen anything showing she can act - here she is required to pout, smoulder and be generally sultry and provocative, all things which come fairly naturally out of what she looks like. What she isn't required to do, however, is demonstrate any real acting ability. And I couldn't see a great deal of difference between her character before and after the demon took up residence in her.Amanda Seyfried has the meatier role, and attacks it with relish.The script is functional and, in places, fun.The horror element is satisfactory and the ending is not bad.The film overall is, of its kind, undemanding fun."]
