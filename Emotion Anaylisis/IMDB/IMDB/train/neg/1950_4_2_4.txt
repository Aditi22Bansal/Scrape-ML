['They took the Kong from Skull Island, an excellent film plus the recent less than excellent Godzilla film and smashed them together into a confused mess. They simply tried to do too much. They take the basic titan fight and added "Journey to the Center of the Earth", "Upside Down" Kong as Indian Jones, "Transformers", a light saber Ax, teens save the world, and a little girl saves the world. The company Apex are the bad guys who are trying to do something good. Good visuals. Just a messed up plot.']
