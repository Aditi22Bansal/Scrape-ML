['The movie starts out as a great man\'s comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics. This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss\'s girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson\'s disease which is why she is a free spirit.Jake falls in love, turning this into "Love Story", then the comedy simply dies.Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb.']
