["Bhoot Police review :A desi Ghostbusters type movie and a supposed horror comedy; Bhoot Police neither scares nor tickles your funny bone. At most, it makes you angry at the slip shod plot, drab screenplay and a rather uninspiring performance from the entire cast. Director Pavan Kirpalani, who made Ragini MMS (2011) and Phobia (2016) earlier, goes horribly wrong this time.If the idea was to make another 'Stree' (2018), sorry to say but Bhoot Police doesn't grab your attention for even a minute from start to finish. In fact, the first five minutes itself make you realise that this is going to be one bore of an endeavor. Saif and Arjun are ineffective. Yami appears lost. Jacqueline looks sexy and still can't act saala. As for Rajpal Yadav and Javed Jaffrey, I sincerely hope that it was the lure of a fat fee which made them sign up for such thankless roles!!Without wasting any more time and effort, I end my rant review with an AVOID warning.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni."]
