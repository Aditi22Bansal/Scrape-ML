["Apparently, everyone watched Lost and are comparing this to it. I didn't, so I'm watching it for itself.Is this the best show? No. But it is bingeable and I did because I wanted to see what would happen and ultimately what was going on.I liked the main female character and couldn't understand why everyone was on her case. I also liked the black make character. Everyone else either made little impression or I couldn't stand them. The KC woman was the real troublemaker and the guy who did try to rape her was also one. Not sorry when he got stabbed. KC could go next.If she was finding things, then maybe they should have been looking for things like she did.People binge shows for two reason -kill time or because the series is great.This show will kill an afternoon."]
