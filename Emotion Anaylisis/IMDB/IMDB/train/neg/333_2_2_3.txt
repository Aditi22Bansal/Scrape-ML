["The saving grace of sadak 2 is sanjay dutt. There is an innocence in his character which makes him lovable on screen. The next best was jishu sengupta as the bad dad. The cinematography and production values were good.\nBut the story has nothing new to offer, script was predictable, the fake guru angle was just unnecessary if the main villain was aarya's dad and how badly they ruined makhrand deshpande's character in the climax where he runs as if a mice runs after seeing a cat. Its a depressing storyline on the lines of logan. But unlike logan, it doesn't hit you emotionally. Most of the supporting cast were wasted especially gulshan grover. Nobody's character was properly developed apart from sanjay, alia and jishu's. Alia hams unnecessarily in some scenes.\nOn the whole sadak 2 is flawed but not a very bad film for me. One time watchable."]
