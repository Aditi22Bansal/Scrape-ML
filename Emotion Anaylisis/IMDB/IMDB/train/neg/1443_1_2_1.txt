["Once upon a time, the world was filled with magic but scientific conveniences eventually replaced magic. In the modern world, elf Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland) lacks confidence, turning 16, and pines for his dead father whom he never met. His brash older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) is obsessed with the old forgotten magic. One day, their mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) finds an old magic staff of their father. Ian uses it to bring back his father but he's only half successful.This could be counted as a failure when compared to the standard exceptional Pixar levels. It just doesn't have that usual Pixar MAGIC. Firstly, the movie should not have started with a magical world introduction. We want to discover it along with the characters, not wait for them to catch up with us. Secondly, the emotional button needs to get hit a lot harder. Up devastated the audience in the first five minutes. This movie needs that so the ending can punch even harder. Quite frankly, the material is in the movie already. It doesn't quite have the power. Thirdly, the half father is weird visually. Without the top, it feels everybody is looking at his crotch. There has to be a better way. Weekend at Bernie's would be a better idea. This is a step down from my Pixar expectations."]
