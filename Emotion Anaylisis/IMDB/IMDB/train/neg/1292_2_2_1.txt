['Russian caviar or alaskan lobster served to the feinsmaeckers of silver screen entertainment, so if youre looking for good script, intellectual dialouges, existensial human ethics, vertigizing filmatographics and senior editing management et cetera dont even try this out. and just a warning to all prone to epilepcy, there are large amounts of blinking lights that may give you the shivering hi!!because its has bad sound, lame special effects, incoherent plot, extremely bad lightsetting and unsteady camera movements, crank call musical score, and stupid children songs chiming outta silly animatronics.so this said, its all bound to become a cult classic for the gory horror nerd, even though just covered in hydraulic oil and for the rest itll become a see-saw within 15 minutes.acting is pretty operational decent from mr cage, but the rest of the cast seems like a bunch of dyslectic whimps that has to be told what to say. its allthough some nice idiopathic comedy in there somewhere, so behold when the grumpy old man gives a small recommend on this one. it would for surtain have been a buster 30 years ago, but 2021 with mr cage at the brink of retirement i can for sure guarantee there are better b-movies out there to choose.']
