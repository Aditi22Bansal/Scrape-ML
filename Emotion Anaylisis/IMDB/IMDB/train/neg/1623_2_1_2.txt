["Let's not beat around the bush, this movie was ordinary - and I'm being nice. It didn't even have glimpses of brilliance. It was let down by bad direction, and bad acting by many of the cast. Though Brice Bexter did a good job for his character, it still wasn't enough to bring some quality to the movie.Apart from bad directing, it needed a solid script, and the editing could do some work. Plus the action sequences, where appalling. It never gave me a sense of danger nor stress in the situation the main characters were in. It failed to convey the uncertainty and the horrors of being in a fire fight in close quarters. The Rambo movies were more realistic compared to what this movie could muster. And Rambo movies were not that realistic.Too many flaws in the movie to mention, but you get the picture.VERDICT: Watch it if there isn't anything else available. Or maybe just take a nap instead."]
