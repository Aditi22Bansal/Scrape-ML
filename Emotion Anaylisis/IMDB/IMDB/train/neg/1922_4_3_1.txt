["I can't believe someone recommended Zombieland: Double Tap to me, much better than the original they said. It doesn't go anywhere interesting at all, the hell?The original's a popcorn flick, but decent. This is just more of the same, without any character development. It's too damn self-aware and Jesse Eisenberg's just bloody annoying. The Luke Wilson, Thomas Middleditch and Rosario Dawson part's just crap."]
