["For many 'The Holiday' has joined the ranks of Christmas classic's in terms of films. I wish them well with this but for me this is an average film that is made marginally better by an all-star cast, who seem to be having a better time than the audience.It's trying to be like 'Love Actually', it's trying to be sweet and romantic, but in the end I just didn't buy into Jack Black's character, or the one played by Kate Winslet.It has it's moments, but for me they are far and few between in an overly long film that could've been over and done with in 90 minutes tops.But it's Christmas, we are kinder to films that are trying to entertain us. Even if this one tries too hard."]
