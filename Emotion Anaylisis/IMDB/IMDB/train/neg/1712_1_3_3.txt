["'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10."]
