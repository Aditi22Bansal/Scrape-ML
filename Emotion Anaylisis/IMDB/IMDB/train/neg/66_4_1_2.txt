['Well, that was disappointing. It started strong with the first few episodes being a rugged western with a feeling of HELL ON WHEELS or maybe FRONTIER. Then they stated in on the town of women who choose to be with each other, don\'t know how GLAAD missed that detail when they were giving the show awards. By the end of the fourth show it had shifted from western to the land of women. There were moments of brilliance with Jeff Daniels playing a truly evil bad guy who quotes scripture in one minute and rapes a mother in front of her family the next. "How can you believe in a god who would create us and create a rattlesnake too? How does that work?" Interesting stuff. Too bad the agenda took over and steered the whole cattle drive into a ditch.']
