['Seriously it was pretty obvious from the start that this had zero story and was basically a feeble attempt to pass a weak porn flick off into mainstream cinemasTo be honest 50 shades of Grey was a load of ðŸ’© and this no different apart from the lead actor in this in my opinion was a lot better looking and sexier than the guy who played Christian Grey .If you want to watch some free harmless sex scenes then you may enjoy what this flick has to offer ,however if you want to be entertained intellectually then forget it! Almost forgot to mention the very annoying pop music played almost right the way through this but then again they needed something to fill the gaps in lack of script I guess!']
