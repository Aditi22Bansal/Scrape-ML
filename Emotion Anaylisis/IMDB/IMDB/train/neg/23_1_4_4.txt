['I am not the target audience for this series. Because of that, I am not going to give the show a score--just talk about it and what other \'oldsters\' like me might think of it."Over the Garden Wall" is a cartoon movie that\'s been split into 10 segments. Because of this, you may just want to watch it all at once. The story is about a boy (probably about 12-13 years-old) named Wirt and his little brother, Gregory. The story is about their weird quest to find their way home from a strange and magical land--which is sort of like a dystopian version of Wonderland. It\'s all very dark and EXTREMELY confusing. In fact, what it\'s all about isn\'t even apparent until episodes 9 and 10! In the interim, you\'ll no doubt be very confused. I say it\'s best NOT to try to think about what you\'re watching--just watch and enjoy the occasional laughs.So is it worth seeing? Well, yes if you have a VERY high tolerance for the strange and confusing. If you demand that the show explain itself and be normal, then don\'t watch. The story, while convoluted and weird, is worth while by the end. The background animations are very nice and there are a few familiar voices such as Elijah Wood and Christopher Lloyd. The bottom line is that it is nice to see Cartoon Network trying something different--and it certainly is different.']
