['This film start with the main female character "Lara" writing letter to her boyfriend "Peter", and she talking about her trip at Korea scene! As turnout, this film is about Lara , and Peter need to separate four years apart, because of their different place of study! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the taking picture scene, overuse of the texting scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the kissing scene, and overuse of the calling names scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Lara signing the so called "New Contract" prepare by Peter! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!']
