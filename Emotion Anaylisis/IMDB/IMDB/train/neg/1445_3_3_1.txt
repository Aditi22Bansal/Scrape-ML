['This film start with the narrator talking about the manor "Manderley", and her employer "Van Hopper" scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of the death of Rebecca! Rebecca actually kill by her husband "Maxim", but eventually overturn by suicide! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the annoying song playing at the background scene, overuse of the dreaming scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse the passing note scene, and overuse of the dining scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Manderley been burned by Mrs. Danvers at the end! At the end, Maxim release from the jail after proving Rebecca kill herself by Mrs. de Winter! Maxim and Mrs. de Winter move to Cairo at the very end! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!']
