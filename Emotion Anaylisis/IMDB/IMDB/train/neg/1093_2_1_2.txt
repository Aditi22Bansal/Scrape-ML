["Don't Breathe 2 (2021) is a movie the wife and I caught in theatres last weekend. The storyline follows Norman Nordstrom as he lives isolated from a society that is falling apart. He protects his little girl and keeps her from local schools and hoodlums. Her curiosity puts his endeavors at risk. One day his little girl is seen in the city and a group of kidnappers follow her home. The kidnappers really don't know how challenging their task is gonna be. This movie is directed by Rodo Sayagues in his directorial debut and stars Stephen Lang (Avatar), Madelyn Grace (Grey's Anatomy), Brendan Sexton III (Boys Don't Cry), Rocci Williams (Wrath of Man) and Adam Young (Sex Education). The storyline and settings for this are way better than they should be. There's a subtle post apocalyptic feel to it with excellent violence and gore that reminded me of a slightly toned down Hobo with a Shotgun. The premise, once it's revealed, is crazy and over the top goodness. The movie starts with two fantastic kill scenes and hits the ground running. The final couple kills are cinematic gold. Loved the special effects and use of various props for their kill scenes. This is a horror fans dream movie that is an absolute must see. I'd score this an easy 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."]
