["You never know - usually it is not good for anything. Especially when it comes to single man missions. And this has the backdrop of real war (written all over it). And it also has the one shot movie - you know when there is no visible cut and according to the filmmaker there wasn't any? I mean there is one moment where we go completely dark, so ... and there is always a possibility to cut. But they swear they didn't do it here, so let's take that at face value.The effects are great, the cinematography was a shoe in for the Academy Award ... and it won. Not a surprise. Having said that, there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Masterfully played (especially if you think about how many takes it probably took to do this) and great production values. This is a masterpiece, no matter if the subject matter is your thing or not"]
