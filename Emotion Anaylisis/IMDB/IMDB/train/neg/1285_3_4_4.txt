["What was the point of the first half of the movie?So I am kinda confused. The start of the movie shows a boy being saved by a Witcher from a monster that kills all his sisters or friends. He gets taken in by the Witchers grows up, then becomes the Witcher that saves himself as a child...then the story continues from here.. But i am seriously confused. I did not fall asleep or anything. It makes no sense to me but even without this, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. Nightmare of the wolf? What nightmare? What wolf? Not much content in this movie, yet not too bad of a flick."]
