["Kong is being kept under-the-dome living on Skull Island and he's not happy about it. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is trying to keep him safe and away from Godzilla. Her adopted deaf daughter Jia communicates with him. Meanwhile, conspiracy blogger Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is investigating and working at Apex Cybernetics. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsg√•rd) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.Honestly, I don't remember the previous movies. I don't know any of these characters. Non of them really matters anyways. I do like the idea of the little girl communicating with Kong. The movie should do more of that. BTH is a little fun as the conspiracy nut. His little Scooby gang has potential but it's not that great. The Hollow Earth is rather silly but whatever. It's stupid but kinda cool at the same time. The TRON ships are out of place. It's a tech mishmash. I don't really need a lot of the human story especially if it's not doing anything interesting. At the end of the day, this is a mindless popcorn flix and it's fine for being that."]
