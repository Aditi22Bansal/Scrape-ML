['Woody Harrelson (Carnage) brings nothing to anything, just his annoying personality. Perfect tool for Carnage. It is all about Woody Harrelson being Woody Harrelson. If you have seen him ranting in Zombieland and the sequel, you know what I mean.Tom Hardy (Venom) has to be the most over-rated actor in the history of cinema. He looks like some kind of klutz, Deputy Doofy from the Scare movies, a mental defective carrying around a psychotic sociopathic parasite that wants to be a comedian. Just the most bizzarro crud you can ever imagine. This is like the modern Abbott & Costello of third-string Marvel Superheroes.Perhaps the most blatant point that everyone ignores is that there is no SPIDER-MAN in the Venom movies. Spider-man is the arch-nemesis of both Venom and Carnage. There are literally hundreds of comic books about Venom or Carnage or both of them fighting Spider-Man. Dozens of trade paperbacks. So how do you do a series of Venom/Carnage movies without Spider-Man? WTF??? How lame is that?']
