["I didn't watch a gem, nor a great movie, not even for this genre so excuse me if I don't have the same opinion as the people that thought it was an exceptional movie. It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one."]
