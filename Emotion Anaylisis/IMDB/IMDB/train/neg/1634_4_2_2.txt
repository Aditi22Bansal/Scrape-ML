["A benevolent superhero, a grounding sidekick, a villain who has a past with the hero, tons of neon-colored CGI, random time travel, a big colorful beam of MacGuffin power, and oodles of complex lore handled with little narrative interest. So it's a Marvel movie...a terrible Marvel movie. Still better than the first one though."]
