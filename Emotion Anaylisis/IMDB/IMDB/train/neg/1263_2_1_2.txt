['Well, I\'m a little bit puzzled and lost. It\'s not bad movie. First half was really good and funny, second half lost it\'s unique point and just lost me as a viewer. Why I\'m puzzled? This movie is called Tom and Jerry and we see them less than half of movie. Better option woul be to change this movie tittle to "Tom and Jerry stuck in comedy" or "Tom and Jerry traveled into different dimension". Now, we see real people and everything, except that, all animals are animated. In one of scenes flowers were animated also. I didn\'t get why and it wasn\'t explained. As an adult I found this film not bad but if the main audience is family with childs I think kids won\'t like this movie. I liked that they added scenes from Tom and Jerry TV episodes, it was very nostalgic. Film was ok, I would recommend to watch it but it still needs a lot of changes to consider as Good or classic movie.']
