['Okie Matt Damon departs his home state, as he has before, to visit his daughter, Abigail Breslin, in prison is Marseilles for killing her lesbian Arabic lover. She says she didn\'t do it. He believes her, but during the trial he got drunk and punched out a British journalist, which didn\'t help Now she has a possible lead, but her defense attorney says it\'s too speculative to bring to the courts. So he stays to do some sleuthing on his own , and gets involved with actress Camille Cottin and her daughter, Lilou Siauvaud.THe two main strength in this movie are Damon\'s performance, which is as seething under a facade of Plains States good manners as I could imagine. Two thirds of his sides seem to be "Yes, ma\'am", even while the audience can see his anger and despair and yes, self-loathing simmer, never quite raising the lid of the pot. The other is Masanobu Takayanagi\'s beautiful camerawork, whose color palette transforms the 3000-year-old city into a watercolor.']
