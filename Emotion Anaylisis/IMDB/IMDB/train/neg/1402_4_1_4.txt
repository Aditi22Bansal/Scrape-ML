["Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here. I'm still wondering what I watched and probably never will get it."]
