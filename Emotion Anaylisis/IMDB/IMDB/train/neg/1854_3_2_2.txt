['It seems like a no-brainer to me that an adult sex comedy should first and foremost be sexy. But director Edward Zwick and his writers must disagree with me, because, abundance of Anne Hathaway\'s boobies and the seemingly endless scenes of naughtiness between her and Jake Gyllenhaal aside, I found little to titillate me in this droopy "comedy."Hathaway, though a fine actress, has absolutely zero sex appeal, so she\'s a terrible choice for this role. And it doesn\'t help that she has no chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Therefore, the entire movie\'s bottom falls out from under it, because the whole point is that these two oversexed young \'uns with a fear of commitment (he because he\'s a mimbo, she because she\'s got a degenerative disease) find in each other the soul mate who makes all the hard things about relationships that they\'ve been trying to avoid worth dealing with. It\'s hard to believe these two are soul mates when they have about as much romantic spark between them as I have with my own sister.Edward Zwick has long held a place in my top 5 list of least favorite directors, and this movie didn\'t do much to change his ranking.Grade: C']
