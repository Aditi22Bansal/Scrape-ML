['The film is not an upbeat musical that I was expecting. It is actually quite depressing, about an immigrant community experiencing hardship in a deprived area. The story is quite slow. The only impressive scene was the synchronised scene, but that was too short. The songs are not very good, and I found a particular song likening New York subway to slave trade rather distasteful. Overall, I did not enjoy it.']
