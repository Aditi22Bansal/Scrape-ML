['The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero "Dead Pool" operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than "Kick-Ass," but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don\'t like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood']
