["I have somewhat mixed feelings about this show. The first episode was perplexing, throwing a lot of stuff at the viewer with little explanation, but I was impressed by the way it all was made to make sense in the last 10 minutes. Still, I wasn't that interested in watching more and only did so because my girlfriend wanted to.The rest of the series is less fancy in the plotting, telling a fairly straightforward story of how a psychopath gang leader's (a great, disturbing performance by Jeff Daniels) obsessive hunt for a renegade gang member intersects with the lives of a town almost entirely populated by women.The cast is good and the story moves well, although some of it feels extraneous and the last episode is a mess (I describe many of its defects in my user review of that episode, if you're curious).If the finale were better I would give this a 7, but even then the darkness and violence can be a bit much. I wouldn't really recommend it, but my girlfriend would."]
