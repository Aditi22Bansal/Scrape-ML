["I won't labor on the plot, but will just make a few comparisons. The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better. This reboot is superior to the initial in every way.Guide: F-words.
