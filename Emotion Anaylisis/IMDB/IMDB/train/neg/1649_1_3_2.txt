["I think Prabhudeva is in too hury to direct this movie I don't know what's the rush. The story of this movie is going on a speed that we can't even imagine I don't know what's the rush not even single scenerio is good. And the background music of this movie is so irritating that I could feel like my ears are gonna go deaf. In the name of Acting all the actors have done overacting. Only SONGS and the movie runtime is better than expected otherwise totally waste of time...."]
