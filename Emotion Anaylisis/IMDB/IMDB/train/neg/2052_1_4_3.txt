['Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.']
