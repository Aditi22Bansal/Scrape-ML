['FORGIVENESS IS BETWEEN THEM AND GOD...\n...IT IS MY JOB TO ARRANGE THE MEETING.Somehow when Denzel Washington says this line it is not as convincing as maybe Van Diesel. Washington and Dakota Fanning did their expected wonderful job, but the ending was all wrong for the movie.The movie starts out slow. Washington plays a Jack Daniels guzzling former CIA agent who reads the Bible. His partner, Christopher Walken, lands him a job guarding Dakota Fanning (Pita). Early in the movie we find out every rich person in Mexico hires a body guard, then gets kidnapping insurance from AIG for 10 million dollars, which the kidnappers know about. This sets you up for the expected plot twists which were not terrific.Denzel doesn\'t want to get friendly with Dakota, but ends up becoming her friend, father, swimming coach, chauffeur, etc. etc. Dakota Fanning gets kidnapped (box information). Denzel uses his CIA "walking tall" methods to go after the bad guys, which includes half of Mexico. The substandard script, slow beginning, and questionable ending took away from the production.The ending should have included a dramatic escape by Fanning involving her ability to swim as the movie centered so much on this aspect of her life.']
