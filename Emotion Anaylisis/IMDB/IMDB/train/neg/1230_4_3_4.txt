['. . . warning our USA Homeland about a threatening incursion of an invasive counter-culture which belligerently refuses to assimilate into our hallowed melting pot. Viewers need look no further than the flags of IN THE HEIGHTS to detect how divisive, imminent and overwhelming these insurgent dangers actually are. You\'ll be able to see one single, solitary Stars and Stripes out of your peripheral vision during HEIGHTS\' 133-minute running time (blink, and you\'ll miss it) as opposed to at least 74 Communist Cuban banners front and center for seemingly half of this dance marathon. Beyond the grotesque gyrations constantly blockading the U. S. taxpayers\' public streets, this cautionary tale stresses the wanton moral turpitude of the foreign flag loyalists. Everyone knows that "Tee Key Torch" marchers are as vile as they come, so of course we see such a burgeoning parade here at 1:31:42. Whether it\'s fixing the lottery results, evading immigration laws, purse-snatching, shoplifting or violent ice cream wars, HEIGHTS deftly depicts an incoming tsunami wave rife with lawless disrespect of American norms, expectations and traditions.']
