["To pay off a debt, small-time pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) agrees to smuggle a shipment of marijuana across the border from Mexico; in order to raise less suspicion, he assembles a fake family, comprising of stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) as his nerdy son, and homeless waif Casey (Emma Roberts) as his daughter.Okay, I'll admit it like most male viewers (I suspect), my main reason for watching We're The Millers was to see Jennifer Aniston doing her well publicised striptease routine, but I actually found the film entertaining for several other reasons: while not all of the gags necessarily hit the mark, those that do are extremely funny and there are enough laughs throughout to make the trip with the 'Millers' worthwhile; the cast is extremely likable and work very well together; and although it's a tad cliché, there is a fuzzy, feel-good factor about the whole thing despite the film being about drug smugglers.Although it's unlikely to make anyone's All-Time Top Ten Comedies list, We're The Millers is an enjoyable enough time waster with the added bonus of Aniston in her undies."]
