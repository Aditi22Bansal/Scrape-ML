['Confusing yes, but good, confusingly good that is. Jason statham rides the plane like the boss of the aces high, its grumpy dirty, bloody and revengeful. One thing is for sure, this sand bank is just for the one who saw it first, so go to bed or your dead.Framing each other on multipel levels is an understatement in this armored value truckin robbin business, so keep your gobs strait, dont flip them out for cleansing cause they might get stolen. So , this is a solid criminal gold nugget, no wonder they kept it reserved for the big screen for quite a while. Its a recommend from the grumpy old man.']
