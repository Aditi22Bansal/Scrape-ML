['I think I saw the first "Thor" movie. All of these superhero movies blend together in my mind. I know I missed some of them, because there was clearly plot exposition that probably would have made "Thor: Ragnarok" make more sense. Oh well, these movies don\'t make much sense even if you have seen them all. They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they\'re over and hope you\'ll be so dazzled that you\'ll forget any crappy parts. It\'s harder and harder for me to watch movies like this and get past the weapon fetishism they all wallow in -- there\'s such an emphasis on how cool you look wielding your big gun, the bigger the better. In the increasingly disturbing American gun culture, it\'s no longer possible (for me at least) to shrug stuff like this off as "only a movie." But whatever...I acknowledge that I probably shouldn\'t be watching movies like this in the first place if that\'s going to bother me.As for the rest? It\'s pretty funny, it doesn\'t take itself too seriously, and it\'s got Cate Blanchett looking sexy as hell in a dominatrix outfit (that is, until she puts on a ridiculous hat that makes her look like one of Satan\'s reindeer). I got tired of it, but as you might have gathered if you\'ve stayed with this review, I\'m probably not the target audience for it.Grade: B']
