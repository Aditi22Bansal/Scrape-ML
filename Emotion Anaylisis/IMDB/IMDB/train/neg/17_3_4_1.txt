["Unlike the 1984 David Lynch film, this one is the correct length and therefore all the more elaborate than the aforementioned version. And because of that, there is more character development and story. But that said, this version I have to say is anemic when compared to the 1984 film version. Here are my reasons: there is no memorable music (unlike the original version which featured a superb score by Toto or Children of Dune which featured a memorable score by Brian Tyler), the acting was okay when compared to the original (there's no Patrick Stewart per say), and the visual effects was far inferior to either the 1984 version and Children of Dune. So, all in all, this film is an okay adaptation of Frank Herbert's beloved novel though it is much more elaborate than the 1984 film version."]
