["This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere. Not to mention locking your kids up in the basement when this comes on."]
