['The brash James T. Kirk tries to live up to his father\'s legacy with Mr. Spock (Z. Quinto) keeping him in check as a vengeful, time-traveling Romulan creates black holes to destroy the Federation one planet at a time.Although I am not terribly familiar with the original series (I was a Next Generation fan), I get the feeling this film exists both within it and not. There are plenty of jokes, many of them cheesy, including the corny "I\'m a doctor" and "Vulcan mind"...It seems they are setting up this film series as an alternate reality. The older Spock (Spock Prime) is from the world we know, but everyone else is an altered timeline. What does that mean for the series? Are they free to make up their own rules?']
