["Calling this film boring would be an understatement. This film is a preachy, lethargic, crude and hollow thriller with neither style nor substance.I kept expecting something good to happen, and it never did. The plot is not good even for a short story, let alone a feature-length movie. The central mystery is really dull and it's presented in the most tedious way possible. Characters are uninteresting and the acting is flat. The monologue by Amit Ji is so preachy, stale and stupid that you really start to wonder about who wrote this crap. In my opinion, those self-righteous kooks, calling themselves protectors of law and justice, were equally at fault and should have been blamed for the casualty.This is waste of time and resources. There is no place for logic and reasoning in this film. The cinematography is good but visuals during the end sequences are reprehensible.The makers said during the release of the film that this is the film that is going to revive our theatres. If this is the kind of movie which is going to be made for theatres, let them be defunct."]
