["(Flash Review)Without researching or dwelling on the facts, as many reviewers have complained about, this story is weighty and engaging. An unwilling prince Henry V is thrust by fate to the throne after his younger brother, designated to reign, is killed in battle. Future King Henry V has vision for peace for England while being pressed to take large swathes of land by force by his father's inner circle; namely all of France for starters. When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used. The story's tone is portrayed serious and gritty with heavy music painting the mood. The acting, editing and production were high quality. Take the story for what it is and it'll be enjoyable."]
