['This film tells the story of a young female FBI agent, who goes to a remote, snow covered Indian territory to investigate the death of a young woman."Wind River" has a slow pace, in keeping with the icy cold environment and the grim topic. It tells why the hunter wants to help, and fortunately he does help work the investigation. It is a chilling take, because I could hardly believe the reaction of those at the workplace just outside the trailer. The community is depicted to be very unsafe, with many members of the community in jail or deserving to go to jail. Life is hard, just to keep living is hard too.']
