["Humanity could be in peril. Twelve black oval alien pods appear in twelve different parts of the world like Denmark and Shanghai...in America, the alien vessel hovers in Montana. Military leaders will seek the assistance of a brilliant young linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) in an attempt to communicate with the extraterrestrials. Who, why, what? Where do they come from; why are they here and what do they want? The linguist will need the aid of global military minds played by Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner, Mark O'Brien, Michael Stuhlbarg and Tzi Ma.There is suspense and wonderment watching intelligent language being created. Creative scenery and Miss Adams is outstanding in what could have been a dull role."]
