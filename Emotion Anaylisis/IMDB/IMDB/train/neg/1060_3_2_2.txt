['In my life and this one comes pretty close to taking the cake. No story until the last minute, terrible acting, "erotic" scenes that made me laugh, weak dialog and in general hands down an awful show. Netflix must have got a huge discount on the purchase price or the director had a nocturnal emission when plotting the show. Scenery was nice though and a better actor than any of the cast. Chalk up a couple of wasted hours on Sunday afternoon. Lots of oral sex, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing but it was funny instead of erotic.']
