["I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.Then i thot lets just enjoy the action but then again none of the fight scenes are noteworthy.Recently i saw Lee's Fist of Fury n i loved the Japanese garden. This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.The editing ruined everything.Cos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.The character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.How conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.Also how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad's murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.I miss those old ninja movies man."]
