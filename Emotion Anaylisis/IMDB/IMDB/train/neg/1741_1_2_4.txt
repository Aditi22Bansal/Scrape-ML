['Back when "THe Wolf of Wall Street" debuted, I had very little interest in watching it. After all, it was infamous for being crude and nasty. Well, tonight I have to stay awake and I found nothing else on demand I wanted to see...so I gave it a try. After seeing it, it WAS indeed sleazy, crude and nasty from start to finish and it seemed typical of many of Martin Scorsese\'s films. And, like his films, it\'s was well made. But for me, it was relentlessly awful and unappealing. Sure, it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars...but despite this I found myself turned off by such a downbeat and unlikable story. Considering that there are over 1200 revews for this one, I really have nothing more to add other than I just didn\'t enjoy it and, in hindsight, wish I hadn\'t bothered.']
