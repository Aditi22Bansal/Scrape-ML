["'Spectre', much like 'Quantum of Solace', has to follow a game changing Bond film, and comes up short.It's hard to say why. All the ingredients that made 'Skyfall' good are retained here, but the story never quite gels, the set pieces veer from silly to stupendous, and at the centre of it all we have Daniel Craig who looks a bit bemused (and dare I say bored) by it all.The tone is off too. Ok, Craig is never going to be a pun heavy Bond like Roger Moore, but his delivery of the 'comedy' aspects is almost delivered through gritted teeth.It's also a violent film indeed, how it was only a 12A is shocking. Eye gouging, suicide, torture- a trip to the cinema with the kids this was not.It all makes for a muddled Bond film, that has now has its ending spoilt, because despite Craig saying he'd never return to the role, come Spring he's back again.Can't wait after this..."]
