["What a depressing cast of characters and story line this was. How the heck did this TV mini-series garner an 8.2 IMDB rating from over 56K IMDB viewers? Surely to God there were not 50,000 plus who worked on delivering this morbid min-series that skewed the undeserved high 8.2 rating were there?Rape, incest and alcoholism all wrapped up in a neat little barf bag called Sharp Objects. Patricia Clarkson's lacklustre performance as the depressed matriarch Adora Crellin, complimented the even worst performance of her estranged daughter Camille Preaker, (lead actress Amy Adams) performance as the helpless victim of an earlier gang rape who comes back home to cover a story for her big city newspaper.This was an overrated TV mini-series and it is the audience that should be outraged not the performers."]
