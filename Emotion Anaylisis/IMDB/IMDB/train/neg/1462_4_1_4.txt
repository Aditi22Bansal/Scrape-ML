["On sugar pills entertainment, but its a flippy floppy quality technical production, with lots of incoherence and a more bold than perfect on the plain things that makes a film a ''good'' film. there are big flaws in the sound production, and the use of score with a volume button turning up and down each time there are dialouges are cheap and unescesarry. the sound management has forgotten how much noise a moving ship makes. and the calmity of the calamity make the silence airpinning irritating. also the editing has its issues, and the plot dives headless back and forth.the acting are following the directors commands and very scriptous, not much freestyling here. the extras panicking do have a low standardto the positive, lots of great special effects and the fruitful light and coloration are faboulous but thats merely it, and its of course positive that the grumpy old man hung on to the end, but its a neat beacon in a rather dark pandemic season so enjoy, its recommendable entertainment."]
