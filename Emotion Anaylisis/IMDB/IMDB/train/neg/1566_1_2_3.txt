["Writer Eoin Colfer noted some years ago that the film version of his Artemis Fowl books has been stuck in development hell. The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel. Instead the film has gone to Disney' streaming channel.Young Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old Irish genius who needs to rescue his father who has been taken by a fairy. His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard. I sense Branagh's finished version was gutted by the producers.Having its theatrical release delayed and then dropped in a streaming service, I doubt this will become the next Harry Potter franchise."]
