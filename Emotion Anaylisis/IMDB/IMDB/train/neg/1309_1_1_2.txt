['Greenland has a grand setting and engages enough, but lacks substance.The end of the world will bring anyone together, one minute it\'s awkward, the next together forever. Don\'t forget there\'s always crazies out there. It\'s like a small portion of "War of the Worlds," really. At the start with the other families at their get together, everyone there knows they\'re the only ones selected. I don\'t believe them going to check for a second, leaving the Garrity\'s to pack, so they can then react, very convenient. Would have been much tougher had they not voluntarily left the house and had to pack with them there. I don\'t understand the anger though, seems like a civilized conversation. They know his profession and why\'s he\'s been selected, he didn\'t have a say, seems petty. The characterization\'s rather thin and performances not particularly memorable, but it\'s alright.']
