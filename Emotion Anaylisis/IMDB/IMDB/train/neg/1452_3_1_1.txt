["Zombies are supposed to be the living dead, but zombies have been so abused and misused that the fad is gone. Zombies are dead so stop beating them.This Korean zombie movie is no different than any other movie ever produced. It is a guy locked up in his apartment playing online games to find out through the news that a dust cloud has come in to the city and is causing people to turn in to zombies.So if it is a dust cloud, why are so few people getting infected when they are running through the streets? you would expect 99% of the population to become infected instantly. And why do people think that humans are some sort of awesome predator with out weapons? We don't have claws, we don't have sharp teeth. Have you ever tried to eat a raw steak? It's nearly impossible unless you cut it up in to very tiny pieces to make it easier to chew.Zombies are worthless and these movies are boring. Please stop making them."]
