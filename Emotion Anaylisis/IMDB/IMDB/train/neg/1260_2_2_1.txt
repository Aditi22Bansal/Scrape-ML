["Kate Beckinsale tries to pull off a Charlize Theron in her latest sci-fi actioner (in the same universe as Crank) to middling results. Not that her arse-kicking is any less exciting. The awkward wig, cosmetics and the obvious presence of a stunt double aside, she's quite solid as this I-hate-people protagonist with an anger problem. But the central plot is so thin and unexciting that the only fun the film offers is in its fast-paced set-pieces. The core element of aggression (being subdued with the aid of mild electrocution) is simply used to deliver short and thrilling but generic pieces of action. The supporting acts (featuring the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney, and Bobby Cannavale) are just what they need to be. The writing (by Scott Wascha) is utterly weak, with a nonsensical plot, zero character development, and some really silly dialogue at times. Jolt is the kind of film that'll get erased from your mind pretty soon after you've seen it."]
