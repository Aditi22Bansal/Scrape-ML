['The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book\'s hero from my childhood. "The Amazing Spider-Man" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi\'s movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Espetacular Homem-Aranha" ("The Spectacular Spider- Man")']
