["It's 1939 Suffolk, England. Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires local archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to dig some mysterious mounts of earth on her property. He sees the potential for an unprecedented Anglo-Saxon find. When he makes a big discovery, prominent archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives to take over the dig. He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine."]
