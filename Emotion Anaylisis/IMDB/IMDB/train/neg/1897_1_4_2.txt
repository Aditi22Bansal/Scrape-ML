["Good looking teen vampire story, that looks good and is about teen vampires. Clearly I'm the wrong person for this YA teen angst vampire tale because I found it the sort of thing thats been done before I don't know how many times (underworld,Lost Boys...). Not a bad film, its just the sort of thing that is aimed at its one audience and really no one else. Certainly the story feels YA, much like City of Ember, even if they try to make it more adult. Frankly this is a movie for fans of the book only (then again I know many fans of the book who hate the film). Yes the cast is good, but the plot just doesn't cut it.(Your choice out of 10. The rating is dependent upon how you feel about the source material and how many times you've seen similar stories)"]
