["The first 2,episodes have Alex Pettyfyr prancing about in i'll fitting trousers and I guess he wanted a big role because the pace is slow enough without being sidelined by this assault story. TV has to move fast and by the time the characters begin to form dimensions you've long since stopped caring anyway. The characters being the usual mix you'd find in any teen slasher flick. the dialogue takes a stab at a certain naturalness- often feeling improvised as scenes can go on and on with bickering and questionable justifications. In the end it's okaaaay but it's full of the oddest montages, bizarre reasoning, suddenly changing motivations, weird long tangents - just hmmmm\n-"]
