["'The Lovebirds (2020)' is a perfectly fine comedy focused around a couple who are drawn into a vague criminal plot that may just be the key to saving their relationship. Needless to say, it's pretty generic. It's also rather unmemorable. The plot is almost as barebones as possible when it comes to its central mystery, which never really resolves - at least, not satisfyingly - and only serves to get the focal couple from set-piece to set-piece. However, some of those set-pieces are enjoyable and everything is competently constructed. The two leads do a decent job with the banter, bickering and obviously improvised observations that comprise most of the run-time. They're not the most charismatic duo but they're easy to root for and are affable enough, making decisions that mostly make sense in-the-moment and living in a relatively grounded world. The film is intermittently chuckle-worthy and it's breezy enough, to boot. It isn't all that atmospheric or compelling, but it's entertaining enough when it gets going. There's just about enough here to adequately pass the time; just don't expect to remember it in the morning. 6/10"]
