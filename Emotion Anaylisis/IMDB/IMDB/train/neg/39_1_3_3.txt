['The first episode of "The Night Of" is phenomenal, and uncommonly suspenseful; the remaining seven episodes never reach the same level. They are engrossing but slow, more of a docudrama on the American justice system, daily prison life, ethnic prejudices, etc. than the promised murder mystery. The resolution of the whodunit is disappointing, using the classic cheating technique of a previously unseen character who pops out of nowhere and turns out to be the real killer (also: are we supposed to not care what happens to the female lawyer?). The series is extremely well-made and acted, but at Top 156 of all time on IMDb as of this comment, I\'d also have to say slightly overrated. *** out of 4 (first episode only is a ***1/2 out of 4).']
