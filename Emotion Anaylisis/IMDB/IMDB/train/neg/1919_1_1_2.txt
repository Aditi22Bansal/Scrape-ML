["Ten years after the events of the first Zombieland movie, our heroes - Tallahassee, Wichita, Columbus and Little Rock - are enjoying life in the White House. Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.The first Zombieland, released in 2009, was great. The plot was a bit random (though its rambling nature had a certain charm) but it was the dialogue that made it so good: very funny and delivered perfectly. Some other great comedic devices rounded off a very funny movie.Zombieland: Double Tap follows in these footsteps with some great lines and comedic moments. Woody Harrelson (as Tallahassee), Emma Stone (Wichita), Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) are in fine form again. Zoey Deutch is great as the beautiful but dim-witted Madison.The film does struggle a bit towards the end though. For 80% of its duration it was a great comedy with very little ambition to be a serious zombie-drama but towards the end it starts to take itself too seriously. What follows is a fairly conventional and flat period of action-drama. Almost made me knock the film down to a 7. Stuck with the 8, but a weak 8."]
