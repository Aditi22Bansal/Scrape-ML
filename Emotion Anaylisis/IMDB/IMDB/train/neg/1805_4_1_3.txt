["Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes."]
