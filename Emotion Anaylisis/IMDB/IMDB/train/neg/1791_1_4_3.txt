['We get a flashback to day 1 and then catch up with Mom (Emily Blunt) and two mute kids and baby Yoda walking barefoot which would make me scream. Maybe a few pair of socks? They spring some traps but manage to stumble upon Emmett (Cillian Murphy) in an abandoned steel mill who is not happy to see anyone. The game of quiet hide \'n\' seek continues until Regan (Millicent Simmonds) gets the idea to go live on an island like they try to do in some zombie films. We discover (plot spoiler?) that the aliens can\'t swim too well and like Killer Tomatoes explode when they hear the song "Puberty Love" or something similar.Guide: No F-word, sex, or nudity.']
