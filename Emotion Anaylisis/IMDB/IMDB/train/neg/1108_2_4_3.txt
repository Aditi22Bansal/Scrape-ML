["...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.It's an interesting film, it's almost like a sci fi film noir, it has that moody, subdued atmosphere, and the appropriate dialogue, the contradiction comes with the water logged Cities and imaginative technology, an interesting contrast of styles.The trailers looked great, the film looks fantastic, but for me there was too much of a focus on the visuals, and not enough on the actual storytelling, which at times was a little drab. Visually though it's amazing, the futuristic world looks awesome, throw in Rebecca Ferguson's gorgeous presence and Jackman's muscles, and you have something for everyone.Imaginative, interesting, just a little too slow for me, it felt like a film hampered by restrictions, which of course it was. 6/10."]
