['While the spoof movie seemed to live a quiet life for quite some years, Scary Movie did resurrect it. Seeing what movies it brought us, it should be charged. But let\'s stay focused on this movie. A movie which makes fun of ... well "Scary Movie"(s).As a basic storyline "Scream" is being ripped off, which originally was called, yep you guessed it: "Scary Movie"! While it tries hard to get as many laughs as possible out of that concept, it is doomed to fail (in my eyes) from the get go. Spoofing a movie, that is already a funny/cynical take on the horror movies, doesn\'t really quite work as good as it should. In contrast to classics, such as "Airplane!", where the object/movie that\'s being spoofed took itself seriously, "Scream" was meant to be funny. So how many jokes can there be? Well not that many, because other movies (or TV Series) get dragged into the mix. Unfortunately it never really hit a high point (one of the best things is the "Wassup" call) with me ...']
