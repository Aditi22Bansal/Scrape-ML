["The Babysitter: Killer Queen: Two years after his clash with the Satanic Cult, Cole (Judah Lewis) is in High School. No one believes his tales of that night, Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind), wisely keeps quiet about the whole thing. Cole has to see the school therapist/nurse and his parents want to send him to a special school. His complicated relationship with Melanie continues, she now has a boyfriend, Jimmy (Maximilian Acevedo), but still invites Cole along to a lake party on Jimmy's uncles's boat. A new Satanic Cult emerges and along with the resurrected old team sacrifice a victim. Cole escapes from their clutches with the help of Pheobe (Jenny Ortega), a new bad ass girl in his class who has an Alice In Wonderland fixation. You get death by decapitation,real flamethrower, homemade flamethrower, boat hook, machete. There are some good in references to Cape Fear, Deliverance etc. Very much a slapstick comedy horror but there are some dark moments. Not up to the standard of the original (maybe too many wacky characters) but we get the origin stories of the original Cult and it's certainly worth watching. Directed and Co-Written by McG. On Netflix. 6/10."]
