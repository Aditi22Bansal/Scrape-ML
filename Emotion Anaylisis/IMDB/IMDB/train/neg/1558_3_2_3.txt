['Some good action sequences including bots \'n\' drones and stuff, the rest is okayish. Like some reviewer quoted Buddha: "expectation is the root cause of sadness", I would conclude, that if you have not much - and even better - no expectations you may kill some spare time but for certain you won\'t get something worth to remember. Outside the Wire is one of those mass products movie companies - here my theory - produce these days on assembly lines on full autopilot mode. The scripts of course are recycled, oops, written by some algorithms. Also I just wonder, do soldiers really talk all the time and that much?']
