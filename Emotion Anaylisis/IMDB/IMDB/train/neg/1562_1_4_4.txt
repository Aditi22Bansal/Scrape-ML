["Charlie (Dan Stevens), his girlfriend Michelle (Alison Brie), his volatile younger brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh's girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand) have rented an ocean-side house for vacation. The owner Taylor (Toby Huss) may be a racist. When Josh's dog goes missing, he suspects Taylor. A camera is discovered in the shower. It culminates in a violent confrontation.This is an indie horror directed by Dave Franco. The story is fine for a striped down horror. I would let Josh kill the man rather than engineer the death. It's meant to alleviate the guilt from him when that's not really necessary. Nobody likes him in the first place. It works a lot better if the extra element is kept off screen for awhile longer. Let the four characters cook in their own juices. The bubbling relationship between these four is the best aspect of this movie.The movie's main difficulty lies in its director. Franco lacks the specific horror action skills. Non of the kills are exciting. The horror could be much scarier. Running at the car window is probably the only good horror shot and that scene is cut short. The body on the cliff would be terrific visual if Franco could incorporate more vertigo into the shots. If you're crashing a car anyways, let's flip it for more exciting crash action. Franco doesn't have the required skills to elevate the horror thriller aspect."]
