['Jordan Peele has been famous as part of the comedy team Key & Peele. It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie, but he did. And his "Get Out" is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire. Basically, it\'s a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still won\'t accept blacks as their equals. Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry\'s songs but would\'ve refused to let him come into their businesses? I don\'t know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but I won\'t deny that it\'s one of the cleverest things that I\'ve seen all year. A mixture of horror, drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama\'s election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).Good movie.']
