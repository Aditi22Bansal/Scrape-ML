["Thomas Wake (Robert Pattinson ) attempts to maintain his sanity being alone in a lighthouse with William Defoe, who smells, talks, and drinks like a pirate. In black and white as a way to say this is an art film and doesn't need to be good or make sense. The acting and soliloquies were great, although after a while you realize this isn't going anywhere.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Valeriia Karaman )"]
