["I would give the worst to That's My Boy(2012), and some others like Mr. Deeds(2002), You Don't Mess The Zohan(2008) and Jack and Jill(2011). But Pixels was his fun to me, has we'll has Anger Managment(2003). Where does Hubie Halloween fall into that, we'll it's pretty bad, the plot goes all around, it's what you'd expect from this type of Adam Sandler comedy, but there where two times I did laugh.\nAdam Sandler gives an over the top performance as Hubie, to the point where he seems to animated to be a real character that can be relatable, Julie Bowen is in this movie just to have a love interest for Sandler, nothing more. And everything else falls flat, Kevin James looks like he's not having any fun here. Halloween comedies can be done, but Hubie Halloween does not quite do it."]
