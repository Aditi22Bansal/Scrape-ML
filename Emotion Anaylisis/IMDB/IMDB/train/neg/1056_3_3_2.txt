["The crew once again comes together and saves the world. They had to create a past and make John Cena the brother of Vin Diesel and the bad guy. Jordana Brewster is back and Helen Mirren in a cameo. No Jason Stratham, but we do get Charlize Theron as the bad girl.The plot is immaterial. There is more car wreckage than what Bruce Willis did to Moscow. Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire. The Pontiac Fiero (plot spoiler) is rated for the icy vacuum of outer space. And Yoda was a puppet. Grab the popcorn, leave your mind at the door."]
