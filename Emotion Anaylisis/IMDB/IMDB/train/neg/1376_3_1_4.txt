["Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains. Perhaps in 2-3 years from now we will have our answer."]
