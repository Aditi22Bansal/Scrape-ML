["The Farrelly brothers have some serious hits under their belt: Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal and Stuck on You. They took somewhat of a writing break between Heartbreak Kid and this movie, Hall Pass. I think they got rusty.There was the typical Farrelly humor with strong and explicit sexual references but very little humor beyond that. I don't know if the movie was poorly written, poorly executed or just a bad idea altogether but I did not like it.The cast were A listers: Owen Wilson, Christina Applegate and the up and coming Jason Sudeikis, yet there was no synergy between them. Furthermore, I think Owen Wilson was outside of his element. I don't think Owen Wilson has much range as and actor. Some roles fit him and others don't; this role didn't fit him. I first saw Jason Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses and I was impressed. I don't think he did a bad job in this movie, but I stopped it during the Jason Sudeikis self-pleasuring scene. The movie was already teetering on mediocrity before that and that scene did it for me.The Farrelly brothers are superb writers and I'm sure they'll bounce back, but this was a swing and a miss. Dumb and Dumber To is coming out soon, I really hope they put their all into it to make it as classic as the first."]
