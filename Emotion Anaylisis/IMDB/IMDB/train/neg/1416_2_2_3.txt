["This 2020 thriller tells about a female author/historian, Veronica (Janelle Monae) who finds herself experiencing traumatizing, racial slavery and tries to\nsolve a way to escape. This isn't bad, but could've been better in my opinion.\nI like the score, Monae does a decent job and she's cute reminding me a bit of Kerry Washington (Django Unchained). The film has some dramatic, violent and tense moments. Give it a try only if you're into psychological thrillers or dramas."]
