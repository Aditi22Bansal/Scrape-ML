["First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers."]
