['This film start with a little boy run away from the monster, and a witcher "Vesemir" saving him scene! As turnout, this film is about Vesemir need to killing a villain "Tetra", who hated witcher! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the blackout scene, and overuse of the drinking scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene quite bloody gore, but overall have slow motion, messy, not intense, and occur in too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after killing Tetra, Vesemir recruit the orphans to join him! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!']
