['My Spy (3 out of 5 stars).My Spy is a fair action comedy film about a CIA agent JJ (Dave Bautista) who surveillance on a lady and her daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman). Until Sophie catches them and blackmails JJ to help train her to be like him.It is a cute fun story. But the story is predictable. The film begins with JJ undercover with a Russian mob in a warehouse that ends in a firefight and chases. JJ is awkward when it comes to being a people person. He attains Sophie bring a parent or friend to school. Going on ice skating. And falling for her mother.It can be cheesy. The action sequences is decent. It does have its fair share of laughs. Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman are both good and charming with there characters.']
