['The Trolls are back ... in village/town. And if you got a song reference there, you might be the right recipient and the right one to watch the sequel here. It has been a while since I saw the first Trolls movie, but I would say these work independently. That being said, I did rememeber the character and who spoke them.But as with every good sequel (or I reckon every sequel for that matter), you get a lot of new character thrown in the mix here. The movie had the bad luck (as many others) of having to be released in a year that we got hit with a pandemic - hello future readers! So it might have been quite more succesful and more on the radar of many more people.The story is quite simple and predictable. It is the songs and the voice cast that really carry the movie along. It is more than fun ... just go with the flow ... or even sing a long! More colors than you can bear probably.']
