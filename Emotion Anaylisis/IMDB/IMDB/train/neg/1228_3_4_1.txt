['I have seen ALL Liam Neeson movies and I watch every new one. Unfortunately this one is lacking punch. It is not a bad movie, simply never getting really suspenseful at all. Kinda boring to be honest, not something I wish for in an "action" movie...The bad: mediocre supporting actors, mediocre dialogue, mediocre photography, mediocre direction. Get the drift?Not any good? This is still a Liam Neeson movie in which he saves the day and becomes a hero. He is still the solid, good guy who will fight for the right cause.Not recommended though because there are many better other Liam Neeson movies out there.']
