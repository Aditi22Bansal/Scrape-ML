['This is a musical biopic of Elton John (Taron Egerton) musical child genius. The film is told as a flashback as an overly dressed Elton John shows up at an AA meeting and tells us his story. It included musical numbers worked into his biography as well as an overuse of flash mobs.Taron Egerton plays a leaner and less nerdy Elton John. He also does his own singing which was dreadful during the high notes and passable else wise. And OMG... it is "tiny dancer" and not "Tony Danza."And BTW, you really don\'t need to "come out." Most folks know you were gay before you did...Pete.Guide: F-word. MM sex (no surprise there). No nudity']
