['With a title like HOUSE OF WAX one can be forgiven for thinking you\'re going to be watching a Vincent Price type character adducting young maidens and embalming them with dumb periphery characters pointing and saying " Oh look at those waxworks . They\'re so life like . If I didn\'t know better I\'d think that they were real people " This isn\'t how things work out and would have perhaps have been preferable to what we have here Effectively this HOUSE OF WAX is yet another long line of horny teenagers in peril which died out sometime in the late 1980s . It\'s easy to understand why because there\'s not a lot of mileage to the formula especially to someone who grew up with this type of movie . If there\'s anything that differentiates it from so many films of this genre it\'s got some graphic torture porn and is a bit more graphic than the norm but even then that\'s only damning praise . Looking on the bright side it gives me an excuse to write another basic uninterested and uninteresting comment disguised as a review']
