["Oh dear. Despite reshoots and a huge amount of publicity here in the UK, the negative reviews kept coming for this film. And sadly in my opinion they are deserved.I'm not saying that the Rex Harrison original, or the Eddie Murphy films based on 'Dr Doolittle' were such classics that the character should be retired, but surely they could've done better than this.I didn't mind Robert D.J, I thought he was good, I didn't mind the Welsh accent, or even the overcomplicated story.What lets this film down is that despite copying the Eddie Murphy films example of having funny people do the animals voices, they get people who aren't funny. Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is."]
