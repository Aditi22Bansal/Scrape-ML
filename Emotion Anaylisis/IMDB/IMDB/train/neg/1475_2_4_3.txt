['I enjoyed this film. However I might have struggled to follow the storyline without the subtitles as it is multi- lingual from Korean, English, French, fillipino, Chinese & Russian. This would be to appeal a worldwide audience and also perhaps appease the investors. It is an ambitious feat.The special effects were decent and I loved the interaction & chemistry between the cast. The child actor is so charming and the bunch of misfits ensue there is a slap stick humour. The action scenes were interesting. This is a dystopian film whereupon hope for humanity lies upon a child.It even has a star wars type fighting. The ending is uplifting...']
