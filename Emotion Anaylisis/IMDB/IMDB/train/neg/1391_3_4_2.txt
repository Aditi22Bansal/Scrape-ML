['Unlike "The Rhythm Section" which was a more realistic tale of someone becoming a revenging superhero this script is straight out of comic book fantasy - no real here. We have a blood stream filled not with blood, but little alien looking nano spiders busily repairing every mishap, i.e. get an arm blown off; within seconds they have made you a new one (forget where all the minerals/calcium for bone, and organic materials for muscle, nerves, etc. came from). The usual formula bad/mad industrialist scientist out to make a load of money & sell his little nano buddies to the highest bidder. Worth eight stars only because the script was a little different & the CGI was fairly decent (although the now decade old grayish swirling stuff is still the main CGI du jour).']
