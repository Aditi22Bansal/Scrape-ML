['Poor old \'Scoob!\'. Meant to be the grand launch of a \'Hanna Barbera Cinematic Universe\' released to great fanfare, due to the pandemic it ended up being shunted to VOD, released in cinemas in some countries, in others not, before ending up on DVD, where it probably has found its actual home.This isn\'t old-school \'Scooby Doo\'. The mystery element is sidelined, making way instead for super-heroes (because there hasn\'t been enough films about them recently...), A list voice actors taking over the roles from the folks who do the straight to DVD films, and a lot of pop culture gags that probably won\'t endear the film to future generations. "Daddy, who\'s Kelly Clarkson?" etc.It is however an awful lot of fun, I enjoyed it far more than I anticipated, and if you can embrace this new take, then you may well enjoy it too.I hope it does end up launching a shared universe series.']
