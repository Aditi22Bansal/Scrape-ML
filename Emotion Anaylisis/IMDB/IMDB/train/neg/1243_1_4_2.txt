["The problem here are the good guys. They come across as purely horrible people. When you first meet them they irritate you, and they do it in the same vapid way people that have a BA in BS think they educated enough to decide what is best for everyone on earth living in situations they have never experienced....... and that attitude carries over to their interaction with the locals, who they insult and belittle in a way that is framed to almost side with the protagonists.So, when the killing starts, they have annoyed you to the point that you want them to lose, and you want to see the backwoods cannibals eat them... just so you don't have to hear them drone on and on in their pedestrian hipster snobbery any longer.So you there is no suspense, no hope that the protagonists make it out a live, because the film took enough time to make certain they irritate you to no end. And that kills the suspense.And then, on the other side, they muted the backwoods hillbilly cannibals too in both appearance and Deliverance style redneckiness, so there is really nothing grotesque or horrible about them, and, instead, so they really aren't frightening, not so deformed, not at all horrific.In fact, the only thing that makes them remotely decent is the fact that they are killing the other characters that annoyed you to the point you wanted to walk away... about 10 minutes into the film."]
