["A sequel to the largely average film that nobody asked for, KILLER QUEEN sees the geeky hero from THE BABYSITTER once more subjected to the machinations of the members of a Satanic cult with bloodshed and murder in mind. It's an action-oriented narrative with tongue firmly in cheek, packed full of pop culture references and jokes and very little more besides. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, the jokes scatological, and the OTT death sequences surprisingly repetitive and tiresome, with every cast member seemingly getting a bucket of blood chucked in their face at some point in the movie."]
