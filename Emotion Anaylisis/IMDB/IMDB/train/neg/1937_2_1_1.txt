['The Farrelly Brothers are some talented names. Their body of work, includes cult-classics, that remain popular amongst, almost, all age groups. I personally am a fan of theirs, and \'Hall Pass\', which is co-written, produced & directed by them, is a decent flick, that manages some earnest laughs in the goings-on.\'Hall Pass\' stars Owen Wilson & Jason Sudeikis, who show their wives restlessness at home, so much, their wives grant them a "hall pass," one week of freedom to do whatever they want... no questions asked.The idea is interesting and funny, and the Screenplay by Bobby & Peter Farrelly, Pete Jones & Kevin Barnett, succeeds by holding your interest in the first hour and brings in a host of good jokes. The second hour, loses grip and reaches to a not-so funny climax. The Writing in the second hour, definitely could have been much better.The Farrelly Brothers have directed the film nicely. Cinematography is up-to the mark, while the Editing is average. Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson is superb. He looks the part and delivers in every sequence. Jason Sudeikis is alright. Jenna Fischer is very good. Christina Applegate also does well. Richard Jenkins is Fantastic in a brief role. Alexandra Daddario is adequate. Others lend good support.On the whole, Though not Hilarious, this comedy still manages some genuine laughs, that make you laugh even after your done watching it.']
