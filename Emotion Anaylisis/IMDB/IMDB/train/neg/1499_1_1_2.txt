["Here is a nice little story about a woman going to meet her girlfriend's parents for the first time without knowing if they will approve of the relationship or not. It was mostly entertaining, even though the girlfriend made so many outrageous choices that a real person would probably easily avoid. It kept my interest, but I didn't really feel the emotion between the two leads. It was a lukewarm romance at best. But generating onscreen passion wasn't really the point. It was about whether this woman would be willing to stay with someone who wasn't being true to herself or their feelings for one another. There was some enjoyable comedy and nice performances, but I don't see it becoming a holiday classic."]
