['In 2257 there is a colony in New World. There is a village of all men who can read each other\'s thoughts. They have been out of contact for a long time. A scout ship crashes with Viola (Daisy Ridley ) being the sole survivor. Unlike men, women\'s thoughts can not be read, but they can see the thoughts of men. The Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen ) wants to do her harm. Viola takes off with Todd (Tom Holland ) to seek refuge in another village.I didn\'t like "the noise" gimmick. It made the film annoying to watch as we hear people talk while their thought is going at the same time as we watch thought-action inside the real world. As typical Daisy Ridley has very little personality.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
