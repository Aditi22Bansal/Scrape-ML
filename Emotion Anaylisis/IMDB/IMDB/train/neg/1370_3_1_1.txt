["LET HIM GO (2020) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lesley Manville, Kayli Carter, Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan. Still waters run deep while family matters is the crux of this lean and mean low-key slow burn drama cum Western vengeance with Costner and Lane as grandparents to a boy now with a 2nd yet shady rural family led by malevolent matriarch Manville (with her Cruella DeVille do to boot). With its smudged pallet of bruised brown and blue-greys by cinematographer Guy Godfree and a steady helm by director Thomas Bezucha - adapting Larry Watson's novel - makes a potboiler of taut tension a work of art."]
