["The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society."]
