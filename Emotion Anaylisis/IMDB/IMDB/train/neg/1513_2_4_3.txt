['Just recently I watched a documentary about child abuse. And this fits right into this. Or fits the bill as some would say. Now it makes sense that this is also based on a true story. The actors in this are phenomenal. But I do understand people having issues with this. Starting with the already mentioned abuse. Mental and physical abuse that is. And for some maybe really tough to comprehend how someone would be that way. But there are explanations and even when others (and myself included) may think: don\'t do it, there seems now way that is helping anyone at all ... that does not take into account what the characters feels that moment. The love for ones mother can be quite big, even when others may think it is undeserved ... another similarity between this and the documentary.This then is not an easy movie to watch at all. This will put you to the test or rather your patience. Try to take this for what it is, flaws and all included. It is not so much about what you yourself would do, but what makes "sense" for the characters to do ... Reality is not always rosy - and this movie is about just that. The tough moments, with very few light moments in between. Be aware of that']
