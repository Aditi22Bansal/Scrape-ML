['This film start with two people walking, and they went into a tunnel scene! As turnout, this film is about a man "Juan" need to survive from the killing of a bunch of people refuse to end The Purge, and eventually reunite with his lover "Adela"! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the training horse scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the dining scene, overuse of the long angle scenery scene, and overuse of the staring scene! Make the film unwatchable! The only intensity in the film is the explosion scene! The car crash scene also very slow! All the killing scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, shaky, just hear the gunshot sound, have slow motion in it, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Juan killing the last people refuse to end The Purge, and unite with Adela! That\'s it! Another disappointed sequel!']
