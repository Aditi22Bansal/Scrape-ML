['Once upon a time there was a little girl with a famous dad who made a decent film with very big movie stars that name droppers and sycophants praised to the heavens. Daddy after all was being ballyhooed for the overlong and execrable GF 3 so why not the kid? Did the US finally have its answer for Leni Riefenstahl? Nope. Seventeen years later the well budgeted banal filmography says otherwise as she returns to the crutch (Bill Murray) that started the rumor around her "talent." It\'s a sorry full circle with Murray continuing the career deadpan unabated and Rashida Jones ably subbing for Scarlett in auteur Coppola\'s ongoing investigation into the older male, younger female dynamic. Murray does his aging best to keep things buoyant but as in previous works (Somewhere being the best example) Sofia\'s tedious buzz killer deadpan ambience brings on the disinterest in no time and the girl that would be Leni is once again minor Nora Ephron without the funny bone.']
