['"Dolittle" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a physician who has the ability of talking to animals going on a new adventure to find a legendary island with the help of his crew and a young boy.I enjoyed watching this movie but I believe that it didn\'t reach its potential or I had high expectations from it. I liked the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. who played as Dr. John Dolittle and it was something extremely different than his previous roles. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Harry Collett\'s who played as Tommy Stubbins and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan it was interesting but nothing more than this.Finally, I have to say that "Dolittle" is a good average movie to spend your time with but don\'t have high expectations from it because you are going to be let down by it.']
