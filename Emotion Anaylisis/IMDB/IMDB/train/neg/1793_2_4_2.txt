['The subject is not new,there were lots and lots of movie where people became waxworks in museums .Andre de Toth has an eponymous movie (1952) where the criminal was in love with a waxy Marie Antoinette.Okay the final special effects are quite impressive when the whole house is melting.But the best scenes are the ones where the horror is mastered:in the church,in the house (where there could be someone alive),and in the places where the "inhabitants " of the town are gathered.The sequence in the movie theater is rather impressive ,and the use of "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?" makes sense ,for the two sisters were monsters too and Davis on the big screen is somewhat waxy .(But make no mistake :Aldrich\'s film is a true masterpiece,which "House of wax" (2005) is not,far from it.) The characters are as uninteresting as any of the "Friday the Thirteenth" boy and girl.And the unexpected final twist is here to justify a more than possible "House of Wax 2" ...Let it melt away!']
