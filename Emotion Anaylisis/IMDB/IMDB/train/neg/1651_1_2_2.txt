["Prabhu Devaa who directed Wanted 2009 which was a remake of Telugu film Pokiri, for its sequel he remakes The Outlaws Korean film which was far better.The film adds all things that most Salman Khan films have like a forced romantic track, comedy and over the top stunts and result it's a messDirection is ok in parts but sucks overall\nMusic is ok, Zoom Zoom is best song, Dil De Diya is amazing, Seeth Maar is ok but Allu Arjuns version was far better and its placement could be betterSalman Khan does his part well though he has done such roles many times and it's time he changes his style\nDisha Patani is for ornamental value\nJackie Shroff annoys in his role\nRandeep Hooda excels while Sudhanshu Pandey has 2 scenes, Pravin Tarde leaves a mark\nSiddharth Jadhav is wasted."]
