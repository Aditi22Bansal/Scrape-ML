["As the episodes went on the more I thought about what's going on the dumber it got:\n1. Made no sense & a cheap scary hook of spirit/ghost having to turn door nobs to enter a room. If they had a physicality to them then where are they when not turning door nobs? Do they suddenly become unphysical? Sometimes they appear normal human like; other times obviously cosmetic dept. dead awhile dead.\n2. Another really cheap overdone scary hook are flashing room lights & the time worn flashlights suddenly don't work.\n3. The usual floating ceiling ghosts; the distant in the hallway ghosts; the creeping behind some piece of furniture ghosts; the dead suddenly opening eyes or sitting up; the predictable jump scare turn your head ghost.\n4. Excessive flashbacks that at times not only made the timelines (and there were many) confusing, but also disrupted any viewer connective storyline continuity.\n5. Lots of screen time filled w/staged acting; mostly focused on family squabbles & parents not believing the kids.Positive:\nNice old house."]
