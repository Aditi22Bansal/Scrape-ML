['So, a stowaway on a mission to Mars. Not only is the idea stupid, it\'s impossible to happen. This is as bad as the Netflix original with Hilary Swank, where the crew barely gets along on another long space mission. The writers of this pap obviously have no idea how hard Astronauts train and that getting along is part of that training. Just a terrible idea, horribly done. Take my advice, read \'The Cold Equations" instead. A way better story but, avoid that adaptation as well where they try to give a morality story a happy ending.']
