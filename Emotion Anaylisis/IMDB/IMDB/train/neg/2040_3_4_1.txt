['First this movie is over 2 hours of a story that is stretched out much too long. And not one of the characters is even approaching being interesting.Second the cinematography is so dark it should have been recorded in black & white.Third 90% of the actors speak as if they are all coming down with laryngitis!Forth the story in itself is just a bore and I cannot see any public interest in it outside of the people that thrive on Medieval European history.Good luck if you choose to suffer this movie.']
