['You know how they say: there\'s nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.The tagline should\'ve read: "If you liked I Am Legend, Aliens, Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Extinction, Warm Bodies, Escape from New York, Zombieland and Ocean\'s 11, then you\'ve already seen Army of the Dead!" (And I know I must\'ve missed another 6-7 films this straight-up ripped off.)As stated, this barely had a new idea, but probably worse, it had almost zero characters to root for. No one was that likable and everyone\'s fate is so horribly predicted from moment one. This felt much less like an homage, than just a very poor attempt at plagiarism.The one Brightside was the Nice Vegas backdrop and creativity with the Strip. I also knew they were filming inside The Cromwell during the pandemic (which probably wasn\'t safe at the time) so it was neat seeing how they transformed the place.Nope, can\'t recommend. The aforementioned movies are 10x better than this cheap cheat. Save yourself from the excruciatingly long and unnecessary 148 minutes.']
