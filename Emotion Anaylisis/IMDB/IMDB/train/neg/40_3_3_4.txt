['This is a bad documentary aside from its bias. Its poorly constructed, and lacks a linear narrative when it was surely appropriate. In addition some of the people interviewed were just star struck hangers on. They typically had very little useful information to provide. The one fat football coach had the nerve to say that if Hernandez has access to legal weed, he might not have committed the 3 murders (that we know of).Its fairly obvious that Hernandez was a sociopathic narcissist as well as a ticking time bomb. His murderous nature had nothing to do with adverse environments and events. It seems trite to have to point these things out, but here we go. Many men are closeted homosexuals, many men lose their fathers in their teens, many men have bad parents, but practically zero of these men are murderers.I thought Aaron Hernandez was a human P.O.S. before I wasted three hours on this garbage. My opinion of him only got worse afterward.']
