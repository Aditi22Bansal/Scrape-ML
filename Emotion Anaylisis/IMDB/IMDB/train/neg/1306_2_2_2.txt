['Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed "The New Mutants" (2020) more then I thought I will be. Don\'t get me wrong - this isn\'t a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn\'t that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed "The New Mutants" as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible "Dark Phoenix". This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it.']
