["This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining."]
