['This film start with a bunch of people having video conference, and the introduction of the medium of a seance "Seylan" scene! As turnout, this film is about Seylan unexpectedly summon an evil spirit causing dead of the six friends! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the yelling scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the searching scene, and overuse of the arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after Haley scare by the ghost, still have a real seance footage conduct by the cast member! That\'s it! Wasting time to watch!']
