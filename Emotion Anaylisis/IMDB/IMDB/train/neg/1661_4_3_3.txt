["I wasn't that much of a fan of the first movie but I still had hopes this for this movie. Whilst it isn't a bad movie, it definitely is a step down from the first movie.Unless you've escaped a mental asylum or on more drugs than all the riverdale writers put together, you shouldn't like the very uncharismatic Noah Centineo. He tries his best but he cones of so bland. He seriously effects the film and the chemistry with Lana Condor. Lana Condor is really great as is Jordan Fisher when they are on the screen, it becomes more investing.My issue is that Lana Condor was a refreshingly different character in the first movie but here she feels like the other movies, the first movie didn't try to be. That being the film is sweet enough despite being riddled with more cliches than your typical teen film. The ending however is a let down.That being said it is an enjoyable film which does have a lot of charm and heart but it just doesn't stand out that much. It is still worth watching and it's not exactly a bad film. I hope if they do a third movie I seriously hope it is better."]
