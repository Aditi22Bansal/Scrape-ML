['"The Forever Purge" is an Action - Horror movie and the fifth movie of "The Purge" franchise in which we watch another annual purge happening but this time it does not stop after twelve hours but continues and seems that will never end.I did not have high expectations from this movie because I had watched all the previous movies of this franchise and the plot is more or less the same in all those movies. The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that "The Forever Purge" is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it.']
