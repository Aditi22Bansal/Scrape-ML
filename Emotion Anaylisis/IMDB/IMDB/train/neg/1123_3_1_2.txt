["I feel the story was too slow without enough substance to fill up the 112 min runtime. The premise of the story just wasn't interesting enough to be that long, and it should've been sped up and trimmed down to no more than 80 min runtime. Casting and performances were great, and probably the main reason I didn't fall asleep. Considering it was put together by fairly newb filmmakers, I'm still giving it a generous 7/10."]
