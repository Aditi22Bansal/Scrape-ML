["If you want a good action movie, this is it. No bull, no complicated back stories, no pointless characters added for diversity, no mercy with any of the others. Except one scene towards the end that had no right being there, it was a damn good movie. And might I add that I thought Jason Statham played the same tough invulnerable unshakeable guy, but differently. He put a ton of stoic pain in the acting that improved this film a lot.And that's the whole review, because other than good action and movie making, there is nothing else there. Perfection is reached when there is nothing else to remove."]
