["Yes, we see on the news, infrequently, rage for whatever reason leading to someone going on a killing rampage. The problem is that this script/movie does what many do which shows a character (unfortunately usually female) unrealistically making no or poor decisions in order to make 90 min. of film violence.\nNear the beginning our lead character is being followed & harassed and she stops at a gas/market station where the attendant is told of potential danger from the driver of the vehicle now also parked in front. The pursuer even tries to run over a man at the station. Neither the attendant nor our pursued female seem to have called the police; there's no indication of store security cameras being used along with traffic video. At that point I'm thinking it's a not too real made-up script."]
