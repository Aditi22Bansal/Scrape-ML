["Rating it 3 not because of Rhea. I see so many reviews filled with hatred towards an accused and just because of that they have rated it 1, it's not even remotely related to the movie, sorry to see so many dumb Indians.Now to the movie, this is just dull and ridiculous. The characters start shady from the beginning, that just ruins any buildup towards a good thriller. They make it so obvious, that you can easily guess what's gonna happen.Despite a strong cast, actors don't have much to do because of a poor script.Just skip this movie. Waste of time."]
