['At this Point in the Evolution of the "Zombie" Genre, it would Take the Second-Coming of a George Romero Style Breakout to Impress.At Least for those Not Addicted and who Worship at the Altar of the "Living Dead" and are as Insatiable as those "Walking Dead" Anti-Heros.Zack Snyder\'s $90 mil. Netflix Movie has Nothing New to Offer,Except Maybe, a "New" Species that is Supposedly Smarter, Quicker, and...wait for it......Emotional.Also, the Running Time of 2 Normal Zombie Movies Spliced Together for that Extra Brain-Bang for the Buck (in this case a Netflix subscription).Set Your Expectations for One More Spoon-Full of Stew that\'s been Boiling Since "Night of the Living Dead" (1968).Then You will Know What You are In-For.It\'s Slicker, Sleeker, and more Scrumptious.More Colorful with a Deeply Layered Visual Scope, Thanks to CGI Artists.Certainly a Zack Snyder Film.Authoring the Writing, Directing, and Cinematography.So Count on Your Personal Feelings of Snyder as a Film-Maker Weighing Heavily on Your Ultimate Feelings.The Length (2hr 20min) Allows for some Personal Side-Stories a Plenty.Some Big Disappointments in the Big-Build-Up Plot that Fizzles and are Ho-Hum.Here\'s One Nit-Pick.Ella Purnell with Her Blazing White T-Shirt,in the Aftermath of All the Mayhem and Blood-Letting,Not a Drop of the Red-Stuff in Sight.She Still Sports a Blazing White Unblemished T-Shirt.It is so Glaring that it almost has to be an In-Joke.But Considering...Maybe Not.Worth a Watch.']
