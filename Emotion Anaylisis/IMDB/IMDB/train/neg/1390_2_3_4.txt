["Surprisingly, 'Bloodshot (2020)' isn't bad. It's sometimes genuinely enjoyable in a camp kind of way, especially in its opening moments, and it's often rather entertaining even when it isn't, for all intents and purposes, all that great. There's some decent action (as well as some not-so-decent action, of course), the performances are all pretty much on point and the narrative does a lot more than you'd expect it to. The movie has a number of generic twists and turns that are somewhat interesting in their execution and its visual effects are often rather impressive (though, again, they often aren't). Sure, the piece is cheesy and outdated, but it's actually kind of fun. However, there's always this element of mediocrity present. Even when you're entertained, you're always aware of some issue. That, along with the fact that it's only ever so good in the first place, makes for an experience that rests somewhere between 'alright' and 'good enough'. It helps that Vin Diesel is just an inherently funny human being, a bit of a walking meme. His presence definitely elevates this, even if it's difficult to put your finger on why exactly that is. Ultimately, this is a decent flick that does exactly what it needs to without taking itself too seriously. It's not great, but it's better than you'd think it would be. 6/10"]
