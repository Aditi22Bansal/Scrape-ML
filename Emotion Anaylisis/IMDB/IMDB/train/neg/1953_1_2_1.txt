["This was an unexpected gem. I guessed I had heard a few good things about it, but I expected something at least decent. The film is actually very good, with a fantastic lead performance at its core. The premise is a simple one that could have not worked at all, but the film is crafted with such care by Mike Flanagan and it really shows. The only flaw I would point out would be the final scenes. Something about their execution didn't work completely for me. Other than that, definitely a film to be recommended."]
