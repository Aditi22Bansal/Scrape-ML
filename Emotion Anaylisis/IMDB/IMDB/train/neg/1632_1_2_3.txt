["Watched the first one last year and di watch this with the family on Christmas Day itself. Very entertaining and again with a bit of singing.Kurt Russel does wel as Father Christmas. Story is okay and funny now and then espescially with the trolls or elfs, call them what you want. Normally I'm not into all those Christmas flick, one happy family and peacufull world but none of that here. One adventure to save the town of Father Christmas.Yep, I liked it.\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 3,5/5\nStory 3/5\nComedy 1/5"]
