["Essentially a two-hander concerning both prominent Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and hustler-turned-FBI-informant Bill O'Neal, 'Judas And The Black Messiah (2021)' tells one of the many frustrating tales surrounding the US government's shady but nowadays not-so-secret efforts to quash any form of racial equality within its jurisdiction. O'Neal is, for the most part, the piece's POV character, acting as a way for the audience see behind the scenes of both the Black Panther party and the FBI's efforts the crush it. That doesn't mean that Hampton is relegated to a lesser role, though; he dominates the screen whenever he's present, yet he's humanised in such a way that he comes across as much more than a series of rousing speeches and steadfast negotiations. Both characters are played almost to perfection, their respective actors - Kaluuya and Stanfield - encapsulating the dualities and nuances that the script demands. It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day. The narrative is really upsetting - angering, even - because it tells the tale of a total massacre of justice; the betrayals of the picture - which extend beyond its title's bold metaphor - hit you where it hurts. 7/10."]
