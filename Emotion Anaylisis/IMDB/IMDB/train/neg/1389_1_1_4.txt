['It was even worse than average. It had so may cons... First of all, it wasn\'t realistic at all. You can\'t just kill people, drive as you want and there won\'t be cops under you, come on. Another bad thing is visuals... well,when you see "horror or action" movie and some scenes look as fake as WWE RAW you know something is wrong with that. There are many plot holes. We still don\'t know why he killed those people at the beginning, who they were, what happened in his life that he is so "unhinged". Ending was bad. Cops can\'t chase him, no one can find him and mom kills guy with scissors... That\'s HUGE No from me, I would never recommend to spend your time watching this film.']
