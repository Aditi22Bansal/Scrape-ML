['The film uses (PLOT SPOILER) the suppression of the catalytic converter by the auto industry as a back story. In Detroit 1954, three men are to "babysit" a family while dad breaks into his boss\'s safe to get documents, documents that have been removed.The plot is rather jerky in how it moves taking enjoyment out of the feature. It s always nice to see Ray Liotta get beat up. Matt Damon in an uncredited role explains the workings of the world.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
