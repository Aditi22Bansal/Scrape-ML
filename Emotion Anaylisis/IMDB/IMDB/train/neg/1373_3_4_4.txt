["I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much."]
