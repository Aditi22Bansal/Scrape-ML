['The movie started with good energy but as the movie moved forward it was getting slow and boringNothing great act by farhan but miss Thakur was good same old concept of sports training and competitions..as it was a sports movie it should had electrifying content and story but this toofan did not had anything..the makers spoiled it by adding love story, unnecessary drama ,unwanted scenes,no good songs etcNo good content on this weekend too.']
