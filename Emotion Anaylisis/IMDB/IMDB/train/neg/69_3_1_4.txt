['The real problem with Hellsing is not the computer animation vs. traditional animation as one person pointed but the lack of gore. The anime has probably a couple of minutes of gore but not that much. The other problem with Hellsing is that a couple of eps move too slow so much in fact that youll fast forward to the action and then rewind to the dialogue.As for the DVD boxed sets every braggs about they aint really nothing. Brief special features only lasting a couple of minutes is not enough for $30 to 50 set. Youd be better download eps of the net for free.Hellsing is good anime just not great. Want great anime see "Gungrave" available fansubbed only "Bomberman", Final Fantasy Unlimited, but Hellsing does have its moments of brillance and eve dark humor like in Episode 2 where an evil vampire gets a "blowjob" while shooting away at the dead corpses around him.']
