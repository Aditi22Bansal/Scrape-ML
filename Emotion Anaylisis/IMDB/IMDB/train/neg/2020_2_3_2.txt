["boy,what a let down this movie was.i viewed the unrated version,which promised more sex,more skin,more laughs.from what i saw,there was very little skin here,not much sex,either,and zero laughs.Elisha Cuthbert is nice,but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was.you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it,and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy.unfortunately,something got lost in the translation for me,as the jokes weren't funny.in fact,i found the movie bland.though this version was unrated,the original version was rated R by the MPAA.in Canada,it was 18A,except for Ontario,which was 14A.i happen to agree withe 14A rating.for me,that's what it should have been rated,including the unrated version.my best advice,if you're a parent,is to pre screen the movie,and decide if you children are mature enough for it.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 5/10"]
