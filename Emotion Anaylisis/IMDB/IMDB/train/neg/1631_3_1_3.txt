['Bad watch, probably won\'t watch again, and can\'t recommend unless you just LOVED the original.If you loved Kurt Russell and the Elves, then you\'re in luck, because there is a LOT of them in this. It\'s literally my 2 least favorite things from the first movie.Fighting for attention, is Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno (the two should have been the focus of the movie), and Julian Dennison (Fire Fist, from "Deadpool 2") as Belsnickel.....a Christmas character I only know from "The Office", and it was not a great character.Honestly, it\'s like they watched the original and were pissed Kurt Russell was outshined by a child and they determined not to allow it to happen again.All the charm and child-like wonder that makes Christmas movies special is drowned in weird action sequences and a very grumpy Kiwi.']
