["While the script is rife with monologues and exhausting rants about politics, art, and criticism, Sam Levinson's 'Malcolm & Marie' has little meaningful to say about anything. The movie starts out solid on its first 20 minutes, but then the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. The performances are compelling, the black and white cinematography is stunning, but nothing can save this movie from its terrible writing."]
