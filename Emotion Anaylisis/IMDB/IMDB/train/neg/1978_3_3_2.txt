["In the tiny town of Centerville, Police Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) confront Hermit Bob (Tom Waits). Officer Mindy Morrison (ChloÃ« Sevigny) is the other police officer. Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton) is the weird new mortician. Farmer Miller (Steve Buscemi) and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) are two of the locals having breakfast at the diner. Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler), and Zack (Luka Sabbat) are passing through the town. Strange things are happening. The earth is off its axis blamed on polar fracking. Then zombies.Director Jim Jarmusch is trying for a meta hipster zombie comedy. It's a more dead-pan and less funny Shaun of the Dead. I'm not his biggest fan and I often rate his films a step lower than the critics. His sense of humor is a little too hip for me. This one is simply trying for fun. It's not trying to be that smart. Bill Murray is perfect for the dead-pan especially without the anger to taint it. The cast is talented and they're having fun. It really translates onto the screen. There are a few truly hilarious scenes. A sword welding Tilda Swinton is super fun when joined with the three small town cops. Sure there is a Star Wars joke but it's so awkwardly done that it's meta hilarious. This is one of the few Jarmusch film that I like much more than the general critical community. I'm just not highbrow like that."]
