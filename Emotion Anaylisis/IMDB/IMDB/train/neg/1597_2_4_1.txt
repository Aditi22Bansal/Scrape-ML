["Dave Bautista is stuck in a rut they keep giving him or hes taking roles that are all the same ....action comedies and with the exception of guardians they are not good!! This was worse than stuber but the same crap, poor dialogue, ok acting, bad action sequences, just a bad movie. Had maybe 2 good lines it wasn't worth watching although it was free on Amazon."]
