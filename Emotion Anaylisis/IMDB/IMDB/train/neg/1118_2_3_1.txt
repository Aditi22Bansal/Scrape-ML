["A girl's boyfriend gets brutally stabbed to death in front of her but no reaction.The entire town, the mall, the hospital, the stadium, etc are almost all empty n no significant elder shown.A hospital without any doctors n security.A minority fella working in a mall is unnecessary handcuffed in a lockup inspite of the killer being shot dead.Except for two brutal deaths towards the end, the movie is devoid of terror, tension n suspense.The death sequence of Kate (Julia Rehwald) is gory n innovative.Let's see how the sequel will fare."]
