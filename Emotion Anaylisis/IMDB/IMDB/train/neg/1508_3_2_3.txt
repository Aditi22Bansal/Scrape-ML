["This wasn't bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive,racist,dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea, they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion, they could've waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie, because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing."]
