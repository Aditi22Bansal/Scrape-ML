["I don't really know what gives a movie a cinematic feel. But i'm so sick of the straight-to-dvd feel that so many of these movies have. This seems to be the case with anything made by netflix. Just because a movie doesn't go to theaters, does that mean it's not allowed to feel cinematic? Maybe there's a rule i'm not aware of.This movie is below average in basically every area. Writing, story, comedy and general entertainment are all lacking. It's not horrible, but not worth my time (1 viewing, 4/13/2021)"]
