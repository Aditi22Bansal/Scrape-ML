["I despise David Lynch's Dune. In my not so very humble opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen. It is utterly nonsensical and impossible to follow, the actors are almost all miscast (except for Sting, Dean Stockwell, and Patrick Stewart, who all mainly work as novelty), and the visuals are hideous. I also tried reading the novel once, but got bored after the first chapter.So when a friend asked me whether I wanted to watch the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries of Dune, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the whole thing. By the end of the first episode of three I was impressed at the technical side of the film. Vittorio Storaro, the same cinematographer who photographed Apocalypse Now and Reds, did an amazing job on this film, even if the visuals do go overboard sometimes. The gimmicks that the filmmakers employed most often worked well, especially the bizarre primary color lighting schemes. By the second episode, I felt I new the plot. By the end of the series, I felt that I knew the characters. While the narrative is still choppy and sometimes hard to follow (the biggest problem is that there are far too many characters in it), it ultimately works well. I felt that I had finally seen what Dune fanatics were raving about. This series is great. See it and forget that David Lynch ever dirtied his hands with his version."]
