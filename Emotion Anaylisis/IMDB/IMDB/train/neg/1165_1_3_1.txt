['An army experiment gets loose outside of Vegas which becomes infected. Sealands piled three high create a wall around the city. The President plans to nuke the city. A crew lead by Dave Bautista is hired to go into the city and rob a casino vault of $200 million and fly away in a small helicopter on top of the roof. The city is filled with zombies.The plot is similar to "Train to Busan II." It felt like "Escape from New Your City." $200 million in $100 dollar pills would weigh 4400 Lbs, i.e. 2 tons. Not something that could be flown in a small helicopter. This is a common missed plot point. Good special effects. Average characters, although they did try to create memorable individuals, it seemed forced.Guide: F-word, brief car oral sex, brief nudity mostly before opening credits.
