['Without a doubt, Frances McDormand has been one of the greatest US actresses of the past three decades. Humble and unglamorous, she\'s the opposite of the stereotypical movie star, making her Oscar wins all that more important. So it\'s no surprise that she now stars in Chloé Zhao\'s "Nomadland", as a laid-off woman traversing the western US. McDormand put so much effort into the role that many of her co-stars - many of whom aren\'t professional actors - didn\'t know that they were working with a professional actress.I\'ve heard of Chloé Zhao for a few years, but this is the first movie of hers that I\'ve seen. I now want to see her other movies. This is simply an excellent movie. The performances, as well as the use of visuals combine to create a look at the effects that the Great Recession had on countless people. Everyone should see this movie.']
