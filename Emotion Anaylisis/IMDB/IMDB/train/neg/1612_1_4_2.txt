["High schooler Ellie Chu is a loner in the mostly white Squamish. She is the Chinese girl who gets derisively called Chu-Chu. She and her father run the local train stop. Her father is still depressed from the lost of her mother. She sells English papers to her classmates and has a crush on popular girl Aster Flores who is dating arrogant jock Trig Carson. One day, clueless jock Paul Munsky asks for help to write a love letter to Aster. She needs $50 to keep the lights on at home and agrees to write one letter.It's Cyrano de Bergerac with a gay twist. It is sincerely sweet and a terrific addition to the Netflix YA catalogue. All three leads are compelling and nice. One roots for these characters. I would push them together faster. First I would start the Ellie-Paul friendship sooner. I do have an issue with the Paul-Aster dates. She is cheating on Trig in a small town and she can't do it in public. The better way to do it is to make Ellie and Paul friends sooner. Aster would see it and use Ellie as a go-between. The side benefit is more sweet awkwardness between Ellie and Aster like the hot spring scene. Otherwise, the dates are good but they wouldn't actually happen. In the end, this could be seen as overly sweet but there is enough sincerity for the most cynical amongst us."]
