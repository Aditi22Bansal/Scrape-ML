['I HATED this movie. it is awful. all of the "scariness" from this "horror movie" comes from the unsettling. it\'s gross for the sake of being gross. it\'s not scary at all. it\'s really weird and annoying and terrible. the only good thing is the main theme song they play a few times, and i\'m pretty sure it\'s the biggest reason i thought the trailer was intriguing. based on the movie, i believe the director has the following fetishes... (1 viewing)\nSPOILERS\n...gay fetish, necrophilia, incest, sex with animals, cannibalism, urinating on yourself. not to mention all the dead animals, autopsies and disemboweling cows... smh. all to unsettle the audience. u suck']
