['The Ultimate Downfall and Devastation of this "New" Entry in Modern-Horror is that there is Nothing New.Every Slasher and Bad-House Cliche is Relied Upon.It Comes Off like Someone\'s Uninvited Cousin.What are You Doing Here?An "Oh So Familiar" Story with Virtually No Twists, No Surprises, and Borrows Heavily on its Betters.A Lackluster Affair with Competent Acting, but the Story is so Lame it Feels Rusty from the Get-Go.The First-Half Absolutely Nothing Happens except some Cheating by one of the Couples.The Second-Half, the Dog Goes Missing. That\'s a Highlight.None of the Characters are that Interesting and some are Unlikable. No One Really Stands-Out. Their All just Inert, Opportunistic, and Soul-Less.The Ending is Confusing After it Ends.Nothing to Recommend to Anyone but Horror Completest.Not Worth a Watch for Anybody Else.']
