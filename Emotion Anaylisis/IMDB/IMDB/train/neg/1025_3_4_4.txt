["Well just okay! Malignant starts out with a curiosity! What's going on here at the hospital? Then we have a women in a abusive relationship. There is many Wan movie scares of bumps, and creeks in the night. Malignant gets interesting, but suddenly turns into Jeepers Creepers. Predictable and lame was the ending. Watchable, but over the top like 80's horror movie. I found the music and shots was an 80 tribute. Like many 80's horror movie Malignant is b ish. Watchable but forgettable."]
