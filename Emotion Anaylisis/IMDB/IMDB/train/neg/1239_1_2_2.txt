["Fairly good CGI of monster insects turning the tables on humans to make them the munchies. Not very believable that only insects & invertebrates get to supersize (also not structurally possible per even high school science).\nCause: The usual asteroid episode encounter w/Earth. Teen hook of teen goes on perilous journey (accompanied by dog of course) to see girlfriend. Left open a sequel monster mash. High school drama class level acting & dialogue.\nI'm rooting for the insects to clean up Earth."]
