["After a flaccid opening half-hour, this slick, globe-trotting rehash by Luc Besson of his earlier hit 'Nikita' nostalgically set in the dying days of the Cold War develops an extremely dry sense of humour with the entrance of Helen Mirren (real name Mironoff) having a rare old time in ugly spectacles as the chain-smoking love child of Quasimodo and Rosa Klebb; and the beginning of the killing spree that comprises most of the rest of the film.The violence - as is usual with Besson - is sexier than the sex, and the film manages the odd surprise with the aid of an interesting flashback structure, with Mirren satisfyingly getting the last word."]
