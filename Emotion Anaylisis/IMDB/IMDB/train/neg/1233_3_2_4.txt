["With this phenomenal cast it should have been a slam dunk decent thriller, its probably not just a 1 but based on my expectations with the director and cast I was expecting so much more. It really never takes hold or has any tension that you expect in a thriller. The premise starts ok but fizzles out and the ending is extremely negative and reveals nothing you dont see a mile away. I mean go read who's in the cast and you'll agree wow we have a classic coming. It was free so not upset so GLAD I didnt see this in the theater!!"]
