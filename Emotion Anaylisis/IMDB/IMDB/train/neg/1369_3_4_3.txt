['You\'d get an ordinary movie seems to be the answer. It\'s certainly an odd reference to Superman--perhaps the strangest since DC\'s most beloved family farmers unexpectedly seemed to turn up in the Marvel movie "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" (2009). Seems weirder to me than even "Brightburn" (2019). That what appears to be the most remarkable thing about a production is that it casts the same duo, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who played Superman\'s adoptive parents in the latest DC cinematic incarnations, "Man of Steel" (2013) and so on, is an indication that not much interesting is going on here. It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn\'t help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, "Let Him Go" is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that\'s about it. There just isn\'t much going on in this superficial "The Searchers" (1956) retread--even if it is a period piece that covers issues of domestic abuse and mistreatment of Native Americans. Leslie Manville evidently relishing her role as the baddie is the highlight.']
