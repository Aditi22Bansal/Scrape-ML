["This was an awful attempt to sequelise a franchise that had run its course in the early 1990s. I mean, it's nice to see Winter and Reeves in their iconic roles after all these years, but time hasn't been kind to this series and Reeves in particular seems awkward and uncomfortable. If they're cringeworthy, so too are the new cast members: hip young females who embarrass throughout, particularly the actress playing Reeves' daughter whose acting is pure caricature rather than performance. The rest is an overload of cheap CGI, story elements borrowed from the earlier films, and a random ending. Poor show indeed."]
