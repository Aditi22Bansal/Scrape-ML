['I really was expecting a bit more from this. The premiss that a bunch of bored, rich, folks kidnap a dozen "deplorables" and plonk them in a wood whereupon they are hunted with guns, grenades and good old bows and arrows could have been quite fun. A sort of "Hunger Games" without the endless CGI. What we do get is a really tame, poorly executed horror flick in which virtually all of the dozen are dead within the first five minutes and we embark on a truly implausible hunt by the survivors to turn the tables. The two in the gas station inject a little levity into the proceedings but otherwise it is rather a missed opportunity that will not linger long in the mind.']
