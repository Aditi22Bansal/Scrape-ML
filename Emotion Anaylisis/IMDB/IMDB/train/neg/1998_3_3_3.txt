["I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good."]
