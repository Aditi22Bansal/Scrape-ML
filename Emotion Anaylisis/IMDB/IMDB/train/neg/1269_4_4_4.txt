["Previously, Pavan Kripalani has given us unique horror films like Ragini MMS and Phobia. But, this time he completely failed.The World they tried to create here was really visually good looking, but it was not enough. The script was very poor. It's neither funny nor scary. No dialogues made me laugh. And the scary moments were clichéd.I only liked Yami Gautam in this film. Besides, I didn't like any of the characters.As there's nothing in the film, you can definitely miss this.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.© MandalBros."]
