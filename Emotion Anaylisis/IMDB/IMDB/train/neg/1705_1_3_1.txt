['This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele\'s song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced "Quantum of Solace", "Skyfall" is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed "Skyfall" a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film.']
