['An American Pickle was a Seth Rogen comedy that was actually in some ways funny and it had a interesting idea and premise about it,we also know how in some films idea like this one easily fails expecely when a actor plays a two roles and they are very similiar to each other,but here Seth was able to pull it off and he give one of his best performances and he was funny in some scenes,script was also solid but it had some very poorly written lines and a predictable moments in it,An American Pickle was a watchable film,it is also one of better Seth Rogen films and i would say that you should watch a film just because of his presance']
