['But ever so cliched, dumb descisionmaking kinda story, with a clumsy caracterbuilding and messed up timeline. it also lacks the realfeel acting, a script that could be better evolved and the historical basement very loose, quite stupid actually., when a load of raindeer calves threatening you with stone and bone quacking some kind of icelandic esperanto, wheres the coherence.apart from some brute forcede bloody gore in between and some fine scenic shoots, there aint much to talk about, so do take the right turn, as the grumpy old man didnt.its a no recommend...']
