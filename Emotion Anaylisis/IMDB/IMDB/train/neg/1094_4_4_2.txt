['This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new "war" is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes.It did not find this one as interesting and entertaining. So to distil it down, what is it about?There is an old John Denver song "Poems, Prayers and Promises" and part of the lyrics go like this:"Talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in\nHow sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care\nHow long it\'s been since yesterday and what about tomorrow?What about our dreams and all the memories we share?"And in a great sense that is what the movie is ultimately saying, find things to believe in rather than accentuate our differences. I found much of it interesting and entertaining, while I found some of it to be dull and uninteresting. It definitely isn\'t a "1" or a "2" but it also isn\'t better than about a "6" or a "7" when compared to other fantasy movies.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.']
