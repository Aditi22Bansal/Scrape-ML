["A group of terrorists take over a flight, unaware that a mother, travelling with her son, is a vampire and will do all that is necessary to protect him.This starts off quite well during the initial hijacking when the film is geared around the terrorists and the vampire sneaking around the plane taking them out. Things get a touch OTT when people start getting bitten and in turn becomes vampires. This is ok fun with buckets of blood, but it's too long, the kid is annoying and the frequent flashbacks showing how the woman became a vampire rather a dull diversion and quite unnecessary. Ok, sort of."]
