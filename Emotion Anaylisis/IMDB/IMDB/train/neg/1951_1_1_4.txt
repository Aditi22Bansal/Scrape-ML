["GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love. I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit. There are flashes of strong material, including a very nasty gore scene, but they come few and far between."]
