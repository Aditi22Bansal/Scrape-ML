["Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie. In so many other movies they would've done a whole thing about that and I kind've love that this wasn't even mentioned, it just was what it was and that's awesome. Movie is still super generic but I dig that."]
