['Balram (Adarsh Gourav ) climbs from village rock breaker to owning his own company, working primarily as a driver for a rich man. He does enough asides as he spouts his socialist message that excludes whites. Not as entertaining as "Slumdog Millionaire" nor is there any dancing. Well done but a slow moving Horatio Alger story. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
