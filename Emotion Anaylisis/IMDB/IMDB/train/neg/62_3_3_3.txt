['My Wife & I really looked forward to this special show and were so disappointed. The characters were interesting in the beginning and then mostly not that likable. Plot so far off and jazzed up with low budget special effects from the original story that it was painful to watch at some points. The events in Neverland were so "Dark" that it was hard to feel good at the end. Poor editing for the TV-Commercial format were like they literally chopped scenes for commercials. The most abrupt ending going to credits and commercials for the next shows not appreciated. SyFy Channel used to do better. Wished we had back the (3)hours of viewing time for something better. Feel sorry for everyone who watched the full 4 hours with commercials.']
