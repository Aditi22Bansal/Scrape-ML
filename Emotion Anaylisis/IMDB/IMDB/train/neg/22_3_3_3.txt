['Pretty average - there is nothing new in the story. The story is jerky and there is no effort made to flesh out any character. The lead moves around in anger and arrogance without reason. The bad guys are generic bad guys, the dialogue switches from okay to plain bad.\nThere are other good shows around, this can be given a pass (special ops, family man, she etc..)']
