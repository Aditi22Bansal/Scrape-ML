['Well, well, well ... what do we have here !!! I do believe Fox is just trying to air anything just to fill the slots in the summer vacation.To be quite fair the pilot wasn\'t that bad yet it wasn\'t really good !! the script was just mediocre even the supposedly thrilling moments weren\'t really jumpy or catchy as they\'re were meant to be, and the the Sci-Fi still not feeling the Wowzer Tech deal to make me engage more that it is really a Sci-Fi.i believe this is the first experience of TV screenplay writing for Max Borenstein and i think he got over-Encouraged to do this after he wrote Godzilla\'s screenplay ,, but i think this was a premature move .As for The Cast,, Stark Sands was just okay his face in feeling fear was fine but other than that it was senseless, Meagan Good is lovely but i think she should be more concerned about the other new show "Mr. Robinson" and just be more active on it,.. Wilmer Valderrama is okay too.Overall,, the pilot went much lower than i expected and i advise no one to pursue watching this.. Unless ... the script get more excitement.']
