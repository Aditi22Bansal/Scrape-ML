["If you get the idea for your movie from somewhere else and then you do a great film, you are an artist. What are you after you get the idea for your movie from at least three different beloved stories and still do a ridiculously bad film?That's the story of this piece of garbage which manages to mix around the ideas of Alien Earth War, The Thing and something like The Forever War or Old Man's War, gets Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons in the cast and then takes all of that goodness and somehow manages to drive it into the ground via a latrine. The incompetence of the writer's staff for this film is astounding. Nothing makes sense in this film, I mean literally nothing.Bottom line: ignore this completely. The only worse film this year is Army of the Dead."]
