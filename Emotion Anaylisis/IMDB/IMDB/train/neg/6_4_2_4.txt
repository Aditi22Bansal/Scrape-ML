['"Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance" is a 2006 mini-series consisting of 10 episodes (5 minutes max, usually shorter) that was made to create a bridge between two seasons of the original series. It runs for roughly the length of a usual episode and features some of the main characters of the show. Thumbs up for that as it\'s not a given. Some shows ("Walking Dead", I think) include random mini-series that do not feature any of the main players. The action includes the rise of new life, the death of old life and some moral questions about the connection between arms and holy places. Director Wayne Rose was assistant director on the original series and made a whole bunch of webisodes, also between other seasons. Writer Ronald D. Moore wrote a lot of these too, but also, even better, also some episodes of "Battlestar Galactica".My favorite episode is the one where they are mourning for the blonde woman that died. All in all, however, I was not wowed enough so that I would feel a need to watch "Battlestar Galactica" anytime soon, maybe also because it is not really my genre. It\'s a good watch for huge fans of the show, but not a must-see by any means.']
