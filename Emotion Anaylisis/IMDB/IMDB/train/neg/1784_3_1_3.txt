['Director Eli Roth continues Making Bad Films and routinely Exposes Himself as a Witless, Childish Filmmaker that has Pretensions of Artistic Entertainment. Roth is just Not Intellectually Astute to make Movies that are Entertaining. He is a Cocky, Small Talent that Thinks He is Clever and Provocative. There comes a certain amount of "Blind Allegiance" to keep Supporting the Ultra-Unsatisfying Stuff He puts out.In this one Keanu Reeves Strains. Some of His Speeches are Cringe-Inducing to Say the Least. Smacking, of ad-lib, it is just Embarrassing.The One-Note Plot involves the Familiar, Heavy Handed, and Deep Lesson about Marital infidelity and its Ramifications. One of the Things Roth Thinks is a Twist in this Dismal Failure may be the Lack of Gore, or any Physical Violence for that matter, in an Against Type Take, but Shows His Vast Inability to Handle Things in a Psychological Thriller. In Eli Roth\'s World "Art Does Not Exist".']
