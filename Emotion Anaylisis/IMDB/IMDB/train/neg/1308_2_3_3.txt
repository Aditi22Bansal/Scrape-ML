['Or World War S for SUCKS, STUPID DECISIONS and SYFY-ENVY.I\'m not ready to call it, but I think Covld\'s killing cinema. I hated this movie. Like unbelievably hated it. And speaking of unbelievable, this movie\'s parents, 1998\'s Deep Impact and Armageddon, had enormously better special effects and those was decades ago.Mercifully, I only spent $3.99 on this rental, which coincidentally enough, was about half its budget. Still, I overpaid for this lazy, boring, unemotional mess of two actors sleepwalking through it and a kid who\'s more bipolar than Harvey Dent.This disaster film deals with every...single...clich√© but done without depth. Regardless, I suppose you\'re supposed to feel for the, of course, divorced parents of a diabetic child and their boring journey to the Title because a comet is set to destroy Planet Earth!I can\'t even comprehend the plot holes, predictable actions, the annoying characters, the needless sacrifices and the most amateur filmmaking since Battlefield Earth. And it really hurts that it\'s 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn\'t give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that\'s so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an "Action Movie" despite having Gerard Butler\'s name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you\'re probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER.']
