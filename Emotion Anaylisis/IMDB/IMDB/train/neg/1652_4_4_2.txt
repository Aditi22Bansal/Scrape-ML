["What a ham movie can't even imagine that it could be so bad race 3 was better than this..I bet this time the fans will also not accept thisWhat a waste of randeep hooda and the quality of villains is also so poor like teasing girls jackie shroff is this the humour you offer us after being such a senior actor..dialogues will make you baffled..all the blames goes to prabhudeva he is taking undue advantage of we respected him for his danceRepeated scenes like give me miss call to get the number ,Radhe is only cop who can solve this ,drugs in the city are some of the loose scenes you will see ..mindless action like Radhe can beat any number and any size of people at a time followed by ham secenes like no body is powerful than Radhe and he is god for every oneLastly Salman was at his worst and Disha was for no useThanks that you made this blunder for 1 1/5 hour."]
