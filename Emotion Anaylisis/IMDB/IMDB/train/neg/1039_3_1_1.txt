['Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it\'s not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of "show, don\'t tell," by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don\'t mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.']
