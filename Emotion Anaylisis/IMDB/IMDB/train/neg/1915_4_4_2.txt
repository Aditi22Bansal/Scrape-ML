['My third theater experience post-COVID and again it\'s from the horror genre. "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It" continues to follow the Warrens (Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga)) and their demon fighting. This movie takes place in Brookfield, Connecticut circa 1981. It begins with them assisting in the exorcism of a little boy named David (Julian Hilliard). The exorcism fails, but the demon left the little boy and entered a young man named Arne (Ruairi O\'Connor). Arne went on to commit a bloody murder and the Warrens were trying their best to prove that Arne was innocent for reasons of demon possession.For the sake of the movie I wanted them to prove their point. For the sake of reality I was hoping they\'d fail-- or succeed yet fail with the jury. I can\'t imagine a bigger monkey wrench in a flawed justice system than an acquittal based upon demon possession."The Conjuring" offered some decent jump scares, but more importantly it had a good plot. The Warrens were trying to uncover a curse. The demon was summoned by someone for some sinister reason and the Warrens sought to uncover it. It was risky business, but it was something they believed in.']
