["The film is only fairly entertaining, but it is very predictable. There's quite a bit of advertising in it, the logo of a sports brand is prominently displayed on two occasions. The inclusion of other Warner brothers films are too hard sell as well. Overall, it is a brainless film that is not very brilliant."]
