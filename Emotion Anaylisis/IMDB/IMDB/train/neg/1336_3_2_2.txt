['UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another "underwater base" flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it\'s a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can\'t make out what\'s going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they\'re really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I\'m a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER\'s okay, but you\'d be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie.']
