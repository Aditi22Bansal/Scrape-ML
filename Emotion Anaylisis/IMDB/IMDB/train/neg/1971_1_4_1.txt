["The Little Things is the worst film Denzel's been involved in, unless he did a comedy with Kevin Hart of course.I don't even know what this is... they both killed someone, the end. This Malek guy's terrible, he just stares the whole time, like one of Michael Shannon's expressions. I fear for the upcoming Bond film he'll be in, the weak dialogue and woeful direction didn't help. Jim gets into the car and then does whatever Albert wants him to do until he becomes enraged. Albert could have killed him at any time as well. Such an empty nothing of a film."]
