["House of Wax (2005) * 1/2 (out of 4) The second remake of Michael Curtiz's Mystery of the Wax Museum is updated to today's times and features six teens stranded in a small town where two psycho brothers are turning people to wax. I'm all for remakes when they can get things right but that's not the case here. There aren't any scares and the first hour is downright boring. I guess the filmmakers were wanting to go back to the 80's slashers but you don't go an hour without any action. When the thing finally picks up it's not too bad and there's some nice twists that happen to our main hero, which isn't normal for this type of film. I can't say I'm a fan of Paris Hilton but she actually did the best job out of the cast. If you need to see wax then check out one of the previous two films. Although the film borrows heavily from those two films this here is more in line with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."]
