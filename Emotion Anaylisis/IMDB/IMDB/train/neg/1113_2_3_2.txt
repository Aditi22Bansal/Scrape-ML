["This sort of feels like Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but not with the same quality. If Scott Pilgrim was a 10/10 this is not even close to being a 10/10.The Pros - Good soundtrack. Quirky characters, Good cast, Cinematography, The flashbacks and the way they seamlessly integrated them in to the movie, lesbian lover assassinsThe Cons - Plot (boring and predictable), Girls (all the girls are good) vs Guys (all the guys are bad), bad guy chewing on a match stick, Fight scenes (too many cuts), choreography of fight scenes, Misc - Limited deus ex machinaRight when I thought it was over, I had to deal with another 15 minutes? At least there was one gratuitous death of the 'good guys' in the end."]
