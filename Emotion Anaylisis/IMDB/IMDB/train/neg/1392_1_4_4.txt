['"Bloodshot" is a poor collection of "Universal Soldier", "Robcop", "Matrix" and \'Memento", among other films, that do not work well. The plot is absolutely predictable and it is possible to the viewer to foresee the story. Despite of the clich√©s, the viewer that is fan of Vin Diesel will certainly find the movie entertaining. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Bloodshot"']
