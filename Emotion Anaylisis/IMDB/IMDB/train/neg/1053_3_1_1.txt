['Action scenes are well coreographed and there are interesting (although in a quite Orientalist spirit) sets. However, the predictable and full of clich√©s script seems to have been made by a machine. Music score is horrible. There are scenes (the car chase must be highlighted here) that seriously look like videogame. Indeed, so does the story. The sequence of important enemies looks like phases of a game. Too much money spent for a too unimportant and characterless movie.']
