["Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is Nobody. He is a suburban family man doing his boring job in a non-eventful routine. One night, two masked people break into his home. His son tries to fight back but he puts a stop to it. He loses the respect of his son and others. Non of them knows about his secret violent past. When his daughter is missing a bracelet, it's the last straw and he tracks down the robbers. His path collides with a brutal Russian mobster.This is Jimmy trying to be John Wick. I don't think Odenkirk is the John Wick type. He's not quiet enough although he tries in the opening. He has a comedic energy that is vibrating to get out. The action is not quite as cool although there is plenty of it. I do not like the Home Alone booby-traps in the last part. Overall, it's an interesting attempt. I like it enough. It's good popcorn waster but it's unlikely to lead to a John Wick style franchise."]
