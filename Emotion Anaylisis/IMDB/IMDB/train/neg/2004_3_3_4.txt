["The beautiful Anna is rescued from a seedy boyfriend and a future of petty crime by the KGB, who deck her out as a model and put her to work as an assassin. But Anna wants out - could the CIA provide her with an exit route?If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Nikita, anyone? As an action/suspense thriller, Anna is fine, if unoriginal. It is a simple story, needlessly complicated by unnecessary and confusing flashbacks - Five Years Ago, Two weeks Ago, Three Years ago... only a couple of these flashbacks actually need to be flashbacks in that they contain a payoff which would spoil a chronologically subsequent moment.Newcomer Sasha Luss is decorative, deals well with the action, and shoots more people than John Wick. The rest of the cast are reliable, although Luke Evans has an air of feeling miscast."]
