["Should've had horror when the car has a flat tire is probably the worst thing about it. Other than the car aspect this Wrong Turn is epic more horror than expected but the main characters aren't very likable where as unfortunately I wouldn't mind if they all died. Its a very mediocre adaptation of a masterful horror! So many bad things happen that's not exciting for the genre; one of few occasions where I support the villains. The terror/violence is easily the best aspect by far!"]
