['This film is about a freed slave partnering with a bounty hunter to seek revenge and free his wife."Django Unchained" is a action western, but it is far too long to be interesting and engrossing. At almost three hours, it is a struggle to follow the story and keep being interested in it. There is far too much dialog to be an action film. For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours. It\'s a Quentin Tarantino film, so you know there has to be a lot of blood to the point of being almost comical, and that almost everybody dies in the end. So why not just cut to the chase and show us what we are expecting?']
