["Russo Brothers trying out new stuff after the MCU. The story is about the life of Cherry: his love life, military life, post-military life, and his demise.The first part of the movie was the weakest. It was loaded with voice over, breaking the fourth wall, and other styles that was meant to engage the audience. Even though I didn't mind them really much, I agreed that these stylistic choices were just there for the sake of substances. They didn't do much to enhance the meaning or themes of the movie.However, the second and third arcs became significantly better. They showed Cherry's life in the military and his use of drugs. Even though the plot type was done countless times before, I thought the Russo's brothers' execution was great. The third arc had a big Requiem for a Dream vibe, and it was pretty hard for me to watch some of the scenes.Tom Holland was marvelous at his role and he sold his character very well. At around the second and third arcs, he became much more serious and this is where he shined the most.Even though the movie was almost 2.5 hours, I didn't feel it was too long and I was hooked into the story. However, I wouldn't watch the movie again because of the length.Overall, an entertaining yet bit rough to watch at times. Quite a roller coaster. 8.5/10"]
