['Multiple Halloween stories all taking place on the same night at the same time. One concerns a man who is decorating his house, another is a girl who is a virgin looking for the right guy, another has an old man fighting a demon, another is the story of a school principle who is also a serial killer. There are also other threads running through this very busy horror film.I\'m going to be honest and say that I don\'t know what I think of this film. Its certainly good, but I went to it hearing about how great and wonderful it was that seeing it I was rather disappointed. To me there are a some chills but no real scares. I think the fragmented nature, the film bounces backward and forward through the night , hurts the film in that no story builds up momentum enough to be truly scary. Don\'t get me wrong the film is full of neat ideas, good looking monsters, great performances and some nice "EC Comics" style twists, but it just didn\'t scare me. Honestly I think had I seen this film sans the hype I would have also thought this film was the next big thing, however as it stands now I like it not love it.Most definitely worth a look or two (I want to see it again closer to Halloween), this is a good solid horror film.']
