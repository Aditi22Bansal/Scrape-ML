['This was an average adaptation of the Scooby-Doo cartoons and stories, and any fan of the franchise will recognize the story and formula. I sort of liked it but was confused by the updates. I liked the Captain Caveman cameo. The story was ok at best. My recommendation is to stick with the classic cartoons, but you might like this movie.** out of ****']
