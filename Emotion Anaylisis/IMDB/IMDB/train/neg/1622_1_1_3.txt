['Anyone who rates this 10 Stars is clearly either IN the movie, WORKING for the movie or a complete idiot.There are so many plot screw-ups in this movie, I really don\'t even know where to begin. The story is dumb. The outcome is predictable. The acting is boring. The fight sequences are so slow and rehearsed as to remind of "backyard wrestling" with 15 year old kids.If you have NOTHING else to watch,... then maybe watch this, but otherwise, save yourself the frustration.4 stars,........... and that is GENEROUS.']
