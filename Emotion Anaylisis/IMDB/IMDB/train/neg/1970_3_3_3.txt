["What was that??? this movie makes you appreciate things in movies that you normally take for granted. so many aspects of this movie are incompetent. the musical score is almost non-existent except for one theme they use during scene transitions. the story, which is already completely basic, is told in such an awkward and discombobulated way. so many things were confusing, not because they were too complex, but because they just didn't flow right.but the worst parts of this movie were a combination of the editing and the dialogue. it was soooooo awkward throughout. there were numerous times where i couldn't tell who was talking. there were scenes where one person was talking but the sound and volume completely changed between sentences. and the strangest thing was the flow of the conversations. the pauses between characters speaking was so odd. it's like they wanted to have fast quippy conversations, but they accomplished this by cutting out the gaps between responses. one character would respond IMMEDIATELY after the other finished his line. it sounded so unnatural. i repeated so many parts to confirm. it happened throughout the movie.other than being an extremely low-quality movie in every aspect except the cast, this movie was just boring with zero intrigue that goes nowhere interesting.
