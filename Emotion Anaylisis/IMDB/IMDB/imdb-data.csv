"['It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (Léa Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no ""Diamonds are Forever."" And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn\'t they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']",Positive
"['""No Time to Die"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Léa Seydoux\'s who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek\'s who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes\' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that ""No Time to Die"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it.']",Positive
"[""NO TIME TO DIE (2021) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Magnussen, Christsoph Waltz, David Dencik, Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah. Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor.""]",Positive

"[""It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent. Still, that message works better if the storytelling convinces us of that point instead of assuming we'll just blindly agree with it.""]",Positive
"[""So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable! This sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was meant to be released last year, finally comes & to be honest it wasn't bad!The film follows Eddie Brock & his new buddy companion Venom as he tries to navigate life with him! But when a super villain also gets a new buddy companion called Carnage, polar opposite to what Eddie Brock has does it get real & it's up to Eddie Brock & Venom to stop him & his girlfriend with super screaming powers!I found the film to be pretty good! It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10.""]",Positive
"[""Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait.""]",Positive
"['The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this ""version"": the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert\'s books quite a few times, and Lynch\'s Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve\'s Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert\'s fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot.']",Positive

['4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.'],Positive
"['I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson ""Romanoff"" character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so ""Yelena Belova"" sounds like one of Ian Fleming\'s innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil ""General Dreykov"" (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it\'s escapist nonsense - it\'s not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it\'s a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again.']",Positive
"[""I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film.""]",Positive
"['""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it\'s an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung\'s who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh\'s who played as Ying Nan, Meng\'er Zhang\'s who played as Xialing and Awkwafina\'s who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.']",Positive
"[""Have been anticipating this film since Halloween 2018 which I found to be a bit of a let down & lacking, but when I heard of this film, I was hoping for it to be better & boy did I get it!The film continues on the events from the last film directly & sees the whole town of Haddonfeild clubbing together to take down the monster Michael Myers for good!I found the film to be good, ok, not quite as gory, but still pretty damn close to it that's for sure! The violence was pretty epic for what it was & the scares were ace! Yes, there's no focus on a specific character, but hey who cares!? The story is simple also & straight forward, that's not an issue! Moreover is the fact that the film continues on directly after the film & sort clears uyp loose ends & back tracks to 1978 also which was good! The violence & body count are revved up in this sequel & put the 2018 film to shame! The eye candy is good also!Overall it's an ace sequel!

"[""James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight.""]",Positive
"[""In a research hospital in 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver faces a growing threat from Gabriel who seems to control electricity. She is forced to order ending him. In present day, a pregnant Madison Lake (Annabelle Wallis) is slammed against the wall by her angry husband. A mystery figure kills him and she wakes up in the hospital. Her supportive sister Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson) tells her that she lost her baby. Police detectives Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) investigate.James Wan comes home to horror. I like the backward facing killer. I don't find the mystery that compelling. More than anything, it's a bit confusing more than compelling. At the end of the day, I kept thinking that there is one easy solution... suicide. The movie never has the daring to approach that subject matter. It was always in her head and that's where the battle was going to be won or lost. The electricity is some odd X-Men addition that seems out of place. On the other hand, I do like the visual dreamscape transitions and the over-the-top action. It's crazy enough to work. There is a lot to admire from James Wan but ultimately, it feels a bit empty.""]",Positive
"[""Is the red hot case in this movie that i underestimated at all levels before viewing, if you search the wikipedia for relevant information on the true facts you will be impressed how the writers and directors have spun a trully develish endaring parapsychologic gory horror thriller story like taken outta the 1980's best ''thing''ishly made products.What i admire most of all is the use of enerving background music that makes your goosebumps scream '' dont turn your back to it'', and the mix of special effects and brilliantly made scene staging, the use of light and dark, sound effects and bloody gory physical fights that will linger your vegetative nerve system for all its worth and may shake your abundant teratomas back to life, like ripley said,''believe it or not.There are some black holes in the timeline of the story, and some intriscic factors that youll find hard to add up when watching, but i was simply overwhelmed by the scare factor that becomes so dominant all the way from the start.Acting is not the top notch on the hyperbel curvature, but still good enough to make you think ''ive got to see this one more time, at the cinema''. So if your in for shock and awe and a little bit of a mental freakshow, do as the grumpy old man did, view it . A big recommend and still searching for my teratoma.""]",Positive

"[""I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10.""]",Positive

James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question.""]",Positive

"['""Infinites"" are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It\'s the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It\'s the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action.']",Positive
"['There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism.']",Positive
"['At Christmas, the enigmatic Green Knight arrives at court and challenges all to fight him. If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though.']",Positive
"['""The Green Knight"" is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch the classic Arthurian legend ""The Green Knight"". Sir Gawain who is King Arthur\'s reckless nephew starts a quest in order to face the eponymous Green Knight but first he will witness some weird facts on his journey and he will evolve as a person and he will better define his character.I have to admit that I did know the legend of ""The Green Knight"" before watching this movie. The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury\'s who played as Mother, Sean Harris\' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander\'s who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie\'s potential. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Green Knight"" is an average movie that failed to reach its high potential of becoming a great movie. Nevertheless, I recommend you to watch it because I believe that you will enjoy it but I suggest you to be patient with it.']",Positive
"['Greetings from Lithuania.""Promising Young Woman"" (2020) is one of the most daring movies i\'ve seen in some time. This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won\'t forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to ""movie"" for me. I really liked it, but it wasn\'t like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, ""Promising Young Woman"" is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise.

"[""Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it.""]",Positive

Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers.The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling.Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right.""]",Positive

"['""Wrath of Man"" had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as ""H,"" which is short for Mr. Hill.

The opening sequence sets the stage for ""H"" infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film\'s opening scene.

"[""After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original.

"['Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the ""Abbott"" family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother ""Evelyn"" (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children ""Regan"" (Millicent Simmonds) and ""Marcus"" (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour ""Emmett"" (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn\'t have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn\'t enjoy it quite so much as the original, it\'s still a fine piece of cinema.']",Positive

I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one.

It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder.""]",Positive

"['""The Father"" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called ""Kitchen Sink Drama""--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, ""Who am I?""It wasn\'t entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne\'s ""husband"" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.']",Positive

However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not?

An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it. He well deserved his Best Actor Oscar.Great supporting cast: Olivia Colman (who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her efforts), Rufus Sewell, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss.""]",Positive

Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play ""Le Père"" with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie\'s rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It\'s a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony\'s conflicted daughter.

His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough.

"['""No Time to Die"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were LÃ©a Seydoux\'s who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek\'s who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes\' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that ""No Time to Die"" is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it.']",Positive
"[""It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent. Still, that message works better if the storytelling convinces us of that point instead of assuming we'll just blindly agree with it.""]",Positive
"[""So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable!

"['The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this ""version"": the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert\'s books quite a few times, and Lynch\'s Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve\'s Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert\'s fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot.']",Positive

"['I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson ""Romanoff"" character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so ""Yelena Belova"" sounds like one of Ian Fleming\'s innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil ""General Dreykov"" (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it\'s escapist nonsense - it\'s not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it\'s a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again.']",Positive

It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future.

He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It\'s the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It\'s the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic.

I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days.

Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn\'t enjoy it quite so much as the original, it\'s still a fine piece of cinema.']",Positive

It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one.

"[""Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder.""]",Positive

"['""The Father"" is a contemporary example of what was formerly called ""Kitchen Sink Drama""--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, ""Who am I?""It wasn\'t entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne\'s ""husband"" would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.']",Positive

An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it.

Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play ""Le PÃ¨re"" with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie\'s rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It\'s a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony\'s conflicted daughter.

When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough.

"[""Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in.

"[""Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told.""]",Positive

Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it\'s a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We\'ve been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can\'t keep a good genre down.

"['I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for ""The Ice Road"", I must admit that I wasn\'t exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in ""The Ice Road"" is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn\'t let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller.""The Ice Road"" was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating ""The Ice Road"" a six out of ten stars.']",Positive
"[""Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's fortÃ© lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers.""]",Positive

The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on.

The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.Of course every fun moment or any moment in general happening here can be taken and dissected.

The story is predictable - but that does not stop this from being really entertaining from start to finish. Great actors round the whole thing up - actaully my first thought concerning a summary line was ""Maze Runner meets Iron Fist"" - ok so it may have been a stretch, especially because there is not really so much hand to hand combat here ... but would be relying more on the actors involved.

The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax.

It\'s got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It\'s a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it\'s not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It\'s all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-']",Positive
"[""Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times.""]",Positive

"[""I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one""]",Positive
"[""This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D.""]",Positive

We are given Dune sand monster w/footsteps on sand; above & below ground spider & web chase & entrapment; sand storm w/electrical discharge; dinosaurs (especially the rib cage scene reminds me of ""Pitch Black"") & fire breathing dragons; flaming swords; 3 masted sand schooner; monolithic mysterious structure; ""Guardians"" raccoon equivalent cat; parallel world.

"['""Minari"" is one heartfelt touching family drama of love and wisdom as a viewer sees how being together grows a family strong no matter what kind of cards are dealt their way. Set in the early 80\'s a Korean American family has moved from the hustle and hassle world of California to the rural south to an Arkansas farm for a chance at the American dream, as new roots of goals and life have been planted. Jacob(the good Steven Yeun) and Monica(Yeri Han) want to break from their 9 to 5 life of working at a chicken factory so Jacob invest in the earth and land and equipment to start planting seeds to grow harvest so he can become a fine farmer. Their two small kids David(Alan S. Kim who\'s so cute) and Anne(Noel Cho) have to adjust to a new school and life that involves church too. And things do twist and spin even more when their stubborn and go against the grain rule breaking grandmother Soonja(Yuh-Jung-Youn) arrives. Grandma is loving and caring though and she brings a little seed of magic and hope to the Arkansas farm! Challenges and ups and downs are common still thru it all this picture shows that at home if a family has love, togetherness, with hard work and determination they will last no matter what happens. Overall wonderful film that one will love watching as they see a strong masterful family.']",Positive

His wife Monica (Yeri Han) and children have experienced culture shock and disappointment as they try to get accustomed with the ""hillbilly"" form of life..Husband and wife get jobs ""sexing"" young chickens, because the males are considered worthless.

"['It\'s curious that this film has been rated 15 - most of the intended audience must surely be younger than that! The premiss is that Blu Hunt (""Danni"") wakes up in an institution where she is told that she has mutant powers and is being cared for until she can master them safely. Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams ""Rahne"" (pronounced rain) but otherwise it\'s a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up.

"[""GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable.""]",Positive
"[""For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment.""]",Positive

"[""'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? 'Run' explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane.

Where a few teens try to hold up in a place to face against a variety of killers while trying to kill the evil.Plot is good. The cast ensemble is good. It took awhile to get used to the same cast playing different characters in 1666 which felt weird at first. Especially the accents they were using. But the story keeps you engaged.

The interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Sarah Fier / Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Henry / Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Lizzie / Kate and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Hannah Miller / Samantha Fraser were for one more time very good.

The plot features Bill and Ted saying that at 7:17pm of this night, they have to write the perfect song or else time will be destroyed. They go to themselves in the future when they make the perfect song.Like the first one, this relies mostly on creativity as its strong point. It really seemed like this didn\'t have that much on comedy as the other ones. It\'s still enjoyable, because it gets very creative. I will admit that it did get a little boring at times and even for a movie that\'s an hour and a half, it could have been shorter.

"[""As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better.

"['There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks (""Capt. Krause"") is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat ""wolf pack"" strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too ""Battleships"" at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written.']",Positive
"[""Greyhound (4 out of 5 stars).Greyhound is a good war film that follows Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) as his ship escorts a group of cargo ships during WWII. Which they come across a nazi submarine that plays cat and mouse with them. As they battle to survive.This film is very fast paced. With very little to none on the character and story development. Occasionally having Krause having flashbacks of his wife played by Elizabeth Shue. The film is non stop action which you may have to buckle up for this wild ride. The plot is good. About Krause captaining Greyhound ship and trying to escort others.The direction does deliver a chaotic battle sequence. Putting you right in the crew's perspective with the action. As they see a sub ascending with a torpedo coming towards them or seeing a ship flashed from an explosion. The action is big, loud, and chaotic which you have to see on the big screen. The music score was great as it created that intense feeling and mood when a threat is near.I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks script which did not have any character development or characterization with anyone. The script is consist of crew members yelling out orders or demands on the ships actions. Which was thin and lacking for about anything else for a war movie.But it was one wild ride that will have you on the edge of your seat.""]",Positive

The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women.""]",Positive
"['""Without Remorse"" is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a United States Navy SEAL seeking revenge for the death of his wife. As soon as he starts searching more about it he finds himself into a large conspiracy that will affect everyone\'s lives.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it had some plot twists that made it interesting. The direction which was made by Stefano Sollima, it was very good and he presented very well his main character, his thoughts and his dreams. The interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as John Kelly was very good and he did an excellent job at his part. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jodie Turner-Smith\'s who played as Karen Greer, Guy Pearce\'s who played as Secretary Clay and Jamie Bell\'s who played as Robert Ritter. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Without Remorse"" is a simple, interesting, action movie that is good to spend your time with, if you have high expectations from it then I advise you to lower them.']",Positive

The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would\'ve been a real hit.

I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress.

"['Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one\'s home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you\'re in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn\'t a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil\'s Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it\'s about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of ""why don\'t they just leave?""

"[""In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes.

Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie.""]",Positive
"[""Exploring themes of grief, trauma, immigration, assimilation, remorse & acceptance through a horror lens, His House is a haunting & harrowing depiction of the refugee experience and, in addition to capturing their inward & outward struggle in adjusting to new life in new place, also delivers as a thrilling & effective haunted house chiller.Written & directed by Remi Weekes, the film blends character drama & genre thrills into one finely layered narrative and holds nothing back when unleashing the terror that dwells within the walls of their new home. While there are times when the story becomes perplexing, everything adds up & makes sense once the full picture of the characters' backstory is revealed.The atmosphere within the rundown residence is palpably tense & often unsettling, and though Weekes relies on jump scares to frighten the viewers, most of them do work out in the film's favour. Wunmi Mosaku & Sope Dirisu play the young refugee couple seeking asylum after escaping their war-torn homeland, and they both chip in with performances that are credible, grounded & convincing.Overall, His House is a welcome entry in the world of horror and also marks a solid debut for Remi Weekes' directorial career. The proper care with which he sketches the characters' troubled past, vulnerable present & uncertain future, and brings it in sync with the immigrant issues gives his picture a relevant touch & relatable appeal. One of the better horror entries in Netflix canon, His House is certainly worth a shot.""]",Positive

You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present.

I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut.

"[""Trolls World Tour (2020) is a movie I watched with my daughter as soon as it came out. The storyline involves a larger Trolls universe where you see how other trolls live. One group of trolls, into heavy metal, feel all trolls should live like them and sets out to make that happen. Can our friends from the previous trolls picture stop the invading trolls? This movie is codirected by Walt Dohrn (Trolls) and David P. Smith (The Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed) and contains the voices of Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) and George Clinton (Good Burger). The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10.""]",Positive

"[""It's all highly cinematic (and exaggerated to an extent) and it's clichÃ©s galore in the characterization department, yet Happiest Season is a film that leaves you emotionally fulfilled. It follows the formula but adds ample doses of heart, making everything magically work. In this film, you'll witness brilliant performances from Kristen Stewart and Dan Levy. Their friendship (more than the film's core lesbian love story) is what stands out as a truly memorable story arc. The thing about the Caldwell household is that nearly everyone's got something to hide, and that makes it a little easier for writer-director Clea DuVall to collectively provide closure to their issues.Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart share decent chemistry as a queer couple. But I've gotta say those few scenes that featured Aubrey Plaza and Stewart make you feel like they had some totally untapped chemistry. That's for another film to tackle, I guess. Happiest Season is tonally all over the place, oscillating between wacky comedy and genuinely emotional moments.

It is though supposed to be a comedy as well with Stewart and catty mum, Steenburgen both on good form. The comedy though switches off half way through and it all becomes pure drama, missing a number of opportunities.

Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal\nWhat did not work:\nThere were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended.""]",Positive

Still, ""Borat Subsequent Moviefilm"", to give it its short title, (and that title in itself reeks of desperation), is still worth seeing thanks to a brilliant, star-making turn from Maria Bakalova as Borat\'s daughter, Tutar.The very thin excuse for a plot has Borat revisiting America with said daughter in tow and a plan to offer her as a gift to VP Mike Pence, (yes, that\'s about as original as it gets). Needless to say, Pence isn\'t interested though his appearance does mark one of the film\'s few inspired moments so the sights are set on Rudy Giuliani who is either even dumber than we thought or a rather good sport for going along with it. The candid-camera style sequences still work but much of this looks rehearsed and the wonderful Miss Bakalova deserves better. Will she deserve the Oscar should she win? Probably not but I can certainly see a long future ahead of her.']",Positive
"['Upfront, I think it\'s fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson ""J.D."" (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it\'s parts.']",Positive

Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It\'s a very compact little movie though it\'s unlikely to cause Bresson\'s ""A Man Escaped"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Papillion"" cause for concern.

Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart.

She is super outgoing and he is not and she does many wild things around his coworkers. Will he find her actions irritating or will they eventually grow on him and help him break out of his more reserved shell? And what will happen with the hotter and more normal Missy?

"['How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It\'s a relatively straightforward story of an hunter ""Goodfellowe"" who, along with his young daughter ""Robyn"" (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young ""Mebh"" (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young ""Robyn"" and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who\'s angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live...']",Positive

In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it\'s not just one long tale-with the other two being \'The Secret of Kells\'_2009 & \'Song of the Sea\'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It\'s rated ""PG"" for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.']",Positive

There is an half-decent sense of jeopardy as the look of the film, too - dark and dingy - helps generate an extra bit of menace. Certainly, it is a cannibalisation of a great many films that have come before; but that doesn\'t make it awful - indeed, though basic in it\'s premiss, the production standards are quite high and it sends a salutary signal to Hollywood that their days of producing derivative, old hat, sci-fi will have to change if they want to keep ahead of the game...']",Positive
"['Greetings from Lithuania.""Sputnik"" (2020) was a very good sci-fi movie. It reminded me heavily of ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"". Its like an ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"" smashed into one and also set in a different place then usual. The place and time is 1983 and its Soviet Union - setting of sci-fi movie you simply won\'t see anytime soon. And this movie kept my attention during its whole 1 h 50 min. Its not just a ""monster"" flick - like i said the whole wibe of this movie reminded me heavily of ""Arrival"" - you kinda feel that there is more to it then it shows. Acting by two leads Oksana Akinshina & Fedor Bondarchuk were amazing in my opinion. Music at the end was haunting and directing of the whole thing was the thing that kept it going.Overall, ""Sputnik"" is a very good sci-fi / horror gem set in a very unique place and time. It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - ""Alien"" and ""Arrival"" - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked ""Sputnik"" on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb.']",Positive
['3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.'],Positive
"[""I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10.""]",Positive

The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this.

"['This film was much needed on the quarter-century anniversary of the massacre of Srebrenica, one of the most bloody pages of the most recent european wars, the Jugloslavian conflicts, that happened so recently yet are unspoken of.Zbanic\'s film is better described as a family drama that happens to be set during Srebrenica than a film about Srebrenica alone. Or better, it is a film that is able to portray the events of Srebrenica yet focus on the personal story of a handful of characters.The main character, Aida, is an interpreter for the UN military unit that was sent to Srebrenica in 1995, and is determined to save his all-male family from the butchery of their invaders. Her character is the center of virtually everything that is depicted, and allows to give a wide glimpse at the most recent genocide occured on european soil. While several of the main characters are invented, they interact at various points with really existing people: Mladic, the ""butcher of Bosnia"", colonel Karremans of the UN military division, among others.One element which I found relevant was how the film underlined the fact that the post-jugoslavian conflicts were a conflict between neighbours, between people who belonged to the same communities, and the epilogue depicts this in a most shocking way.']",Positive

There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean\'s romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean\'s) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey\'s wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn\'t delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter\'s relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine\'s tribute!']",Positive

The couple along with other actors and filming locations look great.Music: The song maskhari is played along twice, the first time it hits the right notes. Second time however it is played when emotions run downside, trying to cheer. Overall even after coming from Rahman music was average.Acting: Sushant stood exception.

Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that\'s a flaw easily forgettable.

While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series\' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in ""Casino Royale"", making its appearance in ""Spectre"" its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than ""Quantum of Solace"", making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond?

They all were suave, cool guys who might have been tough underneath but were classy and right at home in a tuxedo, and had a great sense of humor.This new guy, Daniel Craig, looks like a thug and acts like one. He\'s about as classy as your average rugby player. Give me a break!Even more alarming, the stuff that made the James Bond movies different than the rest of the spy-action movies over the years were (1) the aforementioned classy hero; (2) a lot of fun gadgets, explained by ""Q;"" (3) the humor, including all the corny sexual innuendos; (4) a classy boss in \'M\'; here we have Judi Dench as an irritable, foul-mouthed old bag; and (5) the opening credits with the silhouetted naked women.

Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there\'s still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch\'s M (""God, I miss the Cold War"") and Eva Green\'s Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour).

"[""Word of mouth is not much in favor of this being one of the best Bond pictures. I rather enjoyed the lesser spotlight on gadgets and parade of vixens.

James Bond(Daniel Graig)is asked to put his emotions on hold; but still manages to pursue the identity of the man responsible for his loved one's betrayal and death as well as foil a sinister business man's control of a nation's major asset...not oil, but water resource.The story more than a bit messy, but enough action to keep most everyone happy. Agent 007 gets knocked around, cut and bruised...but as usual his endurance training serves him well. M(Judi Dench)casts doubt on her prized agent that stays on mission in spite of declassification traipsing to Italy, Austria and South America.Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton serve as Bond eye candy and Mathieu Amalric is the cocky and ruthless villain that you want a piece of if Bond leaves any. Also in the cast: Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen, Joaquin Cosio and Giancarlo Giannini.

However, this exposes some of the flaws in Cassie\'s thinking and actions, leaving you less than 100% engaged with her: while mostly on her side, on occasion she does seem more a villain than a hero. On the plus side, this adds to the edginess and unpredictably of the plot.']",Positive
"[""My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered.""]",Positive

"[""Greetings from Lithuania.While with 9 th film in the series they threw all physics and realism out of the window, i would lie if i would say if it wasn't entertaining flick for a boring evening. It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see.""]",Positive

"['If you see the very first one or remember it very well, right from the start you will see the connection. Yes the credits indicate we get the ""true""(?) sequel to the original Halloween. And there are so many nice little treats spread throughout the movie (an actress from the first movie reappearing in a different role, but also shots that are almost the same as in the original ... but sometimes there is a twist for the viewers).The original two main actors reprising their roles too (even if some may argue you can\'t tell with Myers because of his mask). This really is a service to fans and a movie that cherishes the original. Of course since the myriads of sequels introduced a lot of stuff, most of which is thrown out the window (no pun intended). One of the primary things being that like in the original, the Killer and the chosen victim are not related. Even so they have a special bond/relationship. So the only movie you need to watch before this, is the Original movie from 1978 - it will be worth your time. The ending of this new one may feel for some like a let down, but it is what it is and even if it feels like a letdown, it still sort of works in the whole picture']",Positive

This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients ""Lily"" (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother ""MacGregor"" (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you\'d expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It\'s derivative, certainly - it has shades of ""The Mummy"" (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of ""Dead Man\'s Chest"" (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd.']",Positive

Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years.

I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called ""The Joker"", but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And ""The Dark Knight"" is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote.

"['After Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City, Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.']",Positive

Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with ""The Dark Knight"", then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in ""The Dark Knight"" is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then ""The Dark Knight"" really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, ""The Dark Knight"" offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.""The Dark Knight"" was a major step upwards from ""Batman Begins"", and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch ""The Dark Knight Rises"" as well.']",Positive

The girl continues to be a standout among some great veteran adult actors. I would double-down more with the silence concept. I would strip the foley work to a bare minimum and some of the movie background music. Let the silence haunt this movie. Let's go all natural. That would be my biggest change. The other change is when they find the new sanctuary. They need to locate the target right away. They wouldn't take too long of a break. I would have them wake up from exhaustion and rush around trying to find the target. They could stumble upon the boat while on the search and the movie would end the same way.

Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats.

The script has some nice moments too apart from some cringe-worthy one liners, while the action is very intense.

However, the plot is quite familiar and quite preposterous in a sense in the second half, and there is an overload of CGI and sadly it's awful. My two main problems though are both to do with Madonna. One is that her theme song is truly grating and one of the more forgettable theme songs. The other is that her cameo as a fencing instructor is truly dire. In conclusion, a mostly solid if slightly disappointing entry in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox""]",Positive

I kinda wish they brought guys who made ""Raid"" movies fights for a next film - i hope you know what i mean. Also outcome in this movie for what it was came way to quick. Acting was pretty descent for this material. All in all this is fun flick especially if you like the source material.']",Positive
"['Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien\'s ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I\'m not going to summarize the story--there\'s way to much going on.  All I\'ll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that\'s to get in the plot) and there\'s a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I\'ve ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there\'s so much plot and action going on that you\'re exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it\'s the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!']",Positive

"['A pop culture phenomenon, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is unlike anything that you\'ve ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn\'t any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien\'s novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I\'ve never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history\'s most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.']",Positive
"[""This is actually one of the best teen movies in the past few decades that I can think of.First of all, the screenplay is great. Tina Fey did a great job, she is definitely a great comedian. Besides her we also have many other actors from SNL so it is not surprising that it is so good.The storyline is pretty clever. Of course since it is not documentary but comedy it does exaggerate what high school is like but one still can connect to the issues it presents. And it is full of quotes that are just classic now.The characters are all well done to represent different kind of students and parents. And the main characters have a deeper personality, one starts to understand them and their actions the more one gets to know them.Acting is very good as well. Everyone did a great job. I especially want to mention Rachel McAdams who was Regina, the meanest girl o them all. And she was perfect in this role.There isn't anything bad about this movie that I can think of. It is funny from the very start and throughout the movie.""]",Positive
"['Tina Fey of \'Saturday Night Live\' fame writes the screenplay for this very entertaining teen comedy. Cady Heron(Lindsay Lohan)was raised in Africa by her zoologist parents and is thrust into public high school for the first time and must adjust to the whims, deceit and snobbishness of a girl clique known as The Plastics, that gravitates around Regina George(Rachel McAdams). She finds herself being asked to infiltrate the group in order to sabotage the most feared girls in the school. She makes a critical mistake of falling for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend(Jonathan Bennett). A \'Burn Book\' containing vicious rumors and harmful truths written by The Plastics causes chaos throughout the ""girl world"" of this upper middle class high school. Its girl against girl and friend against friend. Who can they trust? Cady goes from \'Africa girl\' newcomer to \'plastic\' to most disliked to most popular girl in school.Fey plays math teacher Ms. Norbury and a couple of her \'Saturday Night Live\' cast mates also have roles: Tim Meadows is Mr. Duvall and Ana Gasteyer plays Cady\'s mom. Others in this quirky comedy are: Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried and Amy Poehler. MEAN GIRLS is a fun movie to watch...I guess because girls will be girls.

"['I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because gay Richard from Big Brother 7 was talking about it all the time in the house, and called many of the girls ""Plastics"" (he was a good housemate). Anyway, basically Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student from Africa, and quite quickly becomes friends with possible-lesbian Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). But soon enough they want her to get to know the crudest, most beautiful and most popular girls in the school, The Plastics, unofficial leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), follower Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). As she gets to know them to tell Janis and Damian their dark secrets, she finds out they have a hate book with every person that has done something they hate them for. Also, Cady falls for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) along the way. There is a lot of back-stabbing and argumentative moments, and I can see why Richard used Plastics as his descriptions, but this isn\'t really one of those great teen or chick flick films, but young girls will probably love it. I guess they are called Plastics because they are pretty much like Barbie dolls, beautiful (almost), naive and compete thickos. Worth watching, at least once!']",Positive
"['this film is the perfect answer. for the memorable scenes. for the impeccable way of revenge. for the great performances. and for many others small details who are axis of a film who represents just a trip of the viewer in the heart of the director universe. at first sigh - nothing new. or surprising. or unpredictable. at the second - a clock mechanism who remains impressive again and again. because, like each film by him, Django Unchained is a homage to the masters. like each of his films, it is a splendid demonstration of action, irony and the perfect cast. and this does Tarantino to be himself. in each occasion. because it is not only a lesson of cinema. but a travel across the cinematography history. so, nothing special from him.']",Positive
"['This film is about the romantic relationship between a handsome, high flying drug representative and an attractive young woman with Parkinson\'s disease.It is refreshing to watch ""Love and Other Drugs"", as it is set in a different background and a different tone compared to other romantic comedies. Jake Gyllenhaal successfully portrays a man with an irresistible charm, complementing Anne Hathaway\'s fragile and sensitive world.The nude scenes is probably the main selling point of the film and the main focus for viewers. This is understandable but is a pity, as it overshadows the deep emotional exchanges and the psychological fluctuations of the characters concerned. I love how the feelings of Jamie and Maggie got juxtaposed after the visit to the Convention for Parkinson\'s disease. Little romantic comedies touches on deeper feelings like this.""Love and Other Drugs"" is a great romantic comedy with substance and chemistry. I loved it!']",Positive
"['A deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer (John Gallagher) appears at her window.Stephen King tweeted about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, ""How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix."" Now, I don\'t necessarily always agree with King. He\'s a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn\'t mean taste can\'t vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as ""Halloween"" (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with ""Wait Until Dark"" is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like ""Wait Until Dark"" being a radio drama.For ""Hush"", we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a ""Buffy"" reference or what?']",Positive

And I simply refuse to refer to the movie as ""Thir13en Ghosts""; I am not a hipster having to include numbers in with letters.It is the story and ghost design that makes the movie being fun to watch again and again. The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in ""Thirteen Ghosts"" are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in ""Thirteen Ghosts"". Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F. Murray Abraham as Cyrus was just perfectly cast.""Thirteen Ghosts"" is not a scary movie as per se, but it is worth watching for the story and the special effects.']",Positive
"[""It's amazing, the Movie too but that in a moment, that People go to see a Tony Scott Film and then complain about the frantic Editing and the constantly moving Camera and the Ultra-Stylish Direction. This IS Tony Scott. It's what made him an always interesting Director. The pulsating rhythm and the flourishes that have now become clichÃ©d is a Style He helped create.This is one of His best. It is a gritty, bloody, very Violent Movie with an underlying motive for Revenge that few could argue. It is an eye for an eye Story that delivers a fiery Yarn that is a surreal study of Good vs Evil with heavy doses of Religion and Philosophy.It is a finely Acted Movie with Denzel, Dakota, and all, adding to this already engaging roller coaster ride. It is a severely saturated Sangre, especially in the second half. There are Industrial Music Samples counterpointed by the sweet vanilla sounds like Linda Ronstadt and the Soundtrack is just one of the many exciting things that the always playful Director uses to Entertain.This is an Action Fans Film with a Heart and the palpitations never end making this a unique, uncomfortable, yet satisfying Movie that never ceases to display itself as an Artistic Vision of a Real-Life tragedy.""]",Positive

I never expected the movie to get half as violent or gory as it did - this is the kind of thing I expect to see in ""se7en"" or ""Saw""... wow! And complementing this perfectly was a soundtrack heavy with Nine Inch Nails remixes.Now, I dislike Dakota Fanning with a passion. She\'s over-used in movies, she\'s not cute. She needs to find a new dentist because her teeth look rotten out. And when she becomes a teenager, her career is over because she can only play cute little blonde, white girls.I did like the use of ""Mickey"" in Spanish while the one guy was getting his just desserts.

His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.']",Positive
"['""The Lighthouse"" is one of the strangest films I\'ve ever seen. Describing it or even knowing whether or not I liked it is pretty difficult. Suffice to say, it was is a very, very unique movie...one that is quite haunting and difficult.The story is set in the late 19th century and a lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe) and his assistant (Rob Pattinson) arrive at the facility for their tour of duty. At first, things seem pretty mundane, though over time they both seem to be losing their minds...Pattinson\'s character in particular. Where it goes from there is ugly, disturbing and weird.This is definitely NOT a film for everyone. In fact, I\'d go so far as to say most people probably would not like the film....and fewer yet would really enjoy it. But it also is a wholly original viewing experience and I can respect the folks who made it. The acting is good....and it feels much like peeking inside the mind of a madman.

"[""Off the Italian coast, Luca Paguro is befriended by fellow sea creature Alberto Scorfano who leads him to live on land. Luca runs away from his home in the sea. While on dry land, the sea creatures look human but they turn back when they get wet. They enter a small town where they are befriended by local girl Giulia Marcovaldo. The trio join up for a race competition. The boys dream of buying a Vespa with the winnings and riding away.This is a beautiful looking Disney Pixar movie. The story is simple and sweet. I do have to say that I missed the closeted gay subtext. I looked at it more in terms of passing. Quite frankly, I wanted more dangerous initial stakes. Luca is more in danger on land. It's perfectly safe for him to go home. There is a way to raise the stakes by taking away a safe return as an emergency exit. If the two boys are refugees and their ocean home destroyed, it would raise the danger and their ultimate stakes. If they have to leave the ocean, it would be a more compelling dangerous journey. There are some powerful scenes. The two boys have a complicated relationship. I love Giulia. All in all, this is wonderful Pixar and a sweet little story.""]",Positive

He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah.

""It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent.

""So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable! This sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was meant to be released last year, finally comes & to be honest it wasn't bad!The film follows Eddie Brock & his new buddy companion Venom as he tries to navigate life with him! But when a super villain also gets a new buddy companion called Carnage, polar opposite to what Eddie Brock has does it get real & it's up to Eddie Brock & Venom to stop him & his girlfriend with super screaming powers!I found the film to be pretty good! It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10.""
""Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait.""
""'The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this version: the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert\'s books quite a few times, and Lynch\'s Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve\'s Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert\'s fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot.'""

'4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.'
""'I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson Romanoff character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so Yelena Belova sounds like one of Ian Fleming\'s innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil General Dreykov (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it\'s escapist nonsense - it\'s not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it\'s a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again.'""
""I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing.

The movie never has the daring to approach that subject matter. It was always in her head and that's where the battle was going to be won or lost. The electricity is some odd X-Men addition that seems out of place. On the other hand, I do like the visual dreamscape transitions and the over-the-top action. It's crazy enough to work.

King Shark is the wild card voiced by Sly as a man-eating cuddly great white in Jams.Have at it!""
""Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question.""
""Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged.""
Anyone who thinks that Fast and Furious has gotten way over the top with stunts and what not ... well wait til you see this. Just the beginning alone takes the cake ... not the car chase per se ... but the stunt out of that ... scene. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.I guess it sets the tone. And then we get Mark Wahlberg. Depending on how you feel about him ... you will love the rest of the movie or loathe it. I was ok with it ... he has some really interesting over the top scenes and stunts. Well his character does. Add to that some really good actors ... or funny ones ... and you have an intriguing if flawed movie. Could be worse ...
""'Infinites are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It\'s the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It\'s the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action.'""
""'There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism.'""
""'At Christmas, the enigmatic Green Knight arrives at court and challenges all to fight him. If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though.'""
""'The Green Knight is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch the classic Arthurian legend The Green Knight. Sir Gawain who is King Arthur\'s reckless nephew starts a quest in order to face the eponymous Green Knight but first he will witness some weird facts on his journey and he will evolve as a person and he will better define his character.I have to admit that I did know the legend of The Green Knight before watching this movie. The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury\'s who played as Mother, Sean Harris\' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander\'s who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie\'s potential. To sum up, I have to say that The Green Knight is an average movie that failed to reach its high potential of becoming a great movie. Nevertheless, I recommend you to watch it because I believe that you will enjoy it but I suggest you to be patient with it.'""

The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to movie for me.

""Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it.""

""In summary my wife and I, grandparents, enjoyed this musical movie as light entertainment. It uses a lot of mostly contemporary songs that are actually sung by the cast. Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers.The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling.Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right.""

""'Wrath of Man had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as H, which is short for Mr. Hill. His real name is Mr. Mace, but the names do not figure in the intensity of the action.The best scenes were those involving a fleet of private armored trucks of the Fortico Company. The opening sequence sets the stage for H infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film\'s opening scene. The bereaved dad stoically plots his revenge by piecing together clues about the perpetrators. Led by an operative known as Sarge and the trigger-happen Jan, the team, of course, is no match for H.The secondary characters were well-developed, especially the operative named Bullett. The associate of H named Kristy could have been fleshed out more completely. But the film succeeded in delivering good location footage around L.

""After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original. I'll just now say we both highly recommend A Quiet Place Part II.""
""'Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the Abbott family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour Emmett (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn\'t have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn\'t enjoy it quite so much as the original, it\'s still a fine piece of cinema.'""
""Don't Breathe 2 didn't need to happen but with the way the first ended I'm happy the story was continued. It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one. Stephen Lang did so great as the blind man that has to deal with a new group of home invaders and a little girl he care-takes.

""Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder.""
""While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films.""

""'The Father is a contemporary example of what was formerly called Kitchen Sink Drama--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, Who am I?It wasn\'t entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne\'s husband would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.'""
""After his previous carer leaves the daughter of an octogenarian, Anthony, organises a new carer for him. However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not? And why doesn't his other daughter visit him anymore?Brilliant. An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it. He well deserved his Best Actor Oscar.Great supporting cast: Olivia Colman (who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her efforts), Rufus Sewell, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss.""
""'The devastating effects of Alzheimer\'s disease (although never mentioned by name) on an aged ex-engineer in London. There is no conventional story in The Father, and that\'s as it should be. Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play Le PÃÂ¨re with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie\'s rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It\'s a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony\'s conflicted daughter. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Hopkins as Best Actor. *** from ****'""
""Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives in his large London flat for much of his adult life. He's showing signs of dementia as he falsely accuses others of stealing his beloved watch. His caregiver daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him that she's moving to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough. This is an interesting movie with some very interesting actors. Maybe the early part of the movie had me expecting too much. I end up reviewing what's not on the screen rather than what's on it.""

Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved.

But half an hour into it, I did get the hang of this violent story and started to like it more...The good: the computer game like action is fantastic and over the top, with some really gruesome scenes that made me look away though (extracting your own teeth!). But all the violence is portrayed in a lighthearted, funny way, just as in a computer game, so I could cope with the gruesome violent scenes. More good: the story (however ridiculous) does have a really nice twist to it, that is rather charming. To top it of, Mel Gibson is back in a great bad guy role, with some cool oneliners and a couple of good jokes. This is simply good old fashioned action fun, with many great looking special effects!Any bad? The leading actor looks like a B-movie hairdresser, without any charisma. But who cares, this is a computer game movie, with only macho fighting stereotypes. It's all about the fun of continuous figthing scenes with a lot of gruesome killings...The story: fight, fight, fight. A man has to relive the same day, every day of his life. And that particular day just happens to be a day in which he gets attacked by dozens of assasins! Will he ever get out of this repeating killing maze?""
""'This film start with a video game layout, and the main character Roy killing the man Mr. Good Morning try to attack him scene!

Such as, car chase scene, car crash scene, bloody shooting scene, sword fighting scene, bloody slicing scene, bloody stabbing scene, things broken scene, and explosion scene!

""I liked it, I don't love Adam, I even have my reservations about these American besteroles, but seeing a hot ex-avenging and winning is comforting, and the movie, although very stupid, is fun pathetic, and ridiculously funny... Worth the time invested...""
""'The bad:\nSeen these kind of action thrillers before. They are pretty much all the same. There is nothing new to this story either and there are a few pretty implausible plot turns, that prevent it from becoming a spectacular thriller. BUT it is still a rather enjoyable action thriller, for those whose demands are not too high...The good:\nThe acting is pretty good. Angelina Jolie is still beautiful at her older age and she still mesmirizes me with her acting skills. The other actors aint bad either. Despite some predictable and implausible plot turns and despite a predictable happy end, there is still enough action and suspense to keep me entertained. Rather impressive firestorm photography tops it of...The story: Angelina Jolie protects a kid who witnessed a murder, during a firestorm. Will they survive both the fire and the killers who are chasing them? Duh...'""
""Well its a film where smeone gets pursued and tried eliminated, the only problem for me is to figure out why???. Try it yourself and you may feel the same. Is it a political inspired take out due to reduced budgets on a federal scale, and howcome the film starts in florida with a person that you arent given any background stuff about less than he has a brother in law out west, montana working as a police officer there... well the plot and story aint the best unfolded one, but its kind of chilling, much thanks to a rush of nonstop action, killings and pursuits with some decent acting all over. I think the actors doing the ''take em out'' roles does a real good effort , acting as a crook agent or whatever, some are just born to be sly when acting...so if youre in for the firefight there aint any fight, just a fight for life and fight against ptsd. So grap a ticket while its still hot and available in the theater, cause the rush of adrenaline is the proclaims the grumpy old man, with a recommend.""

""'If you know your greek you will recognize this tweaked version of a Scarface quote (the 80s Scarface that is in case you have a very well versed film knowledge). Another thing to know: the film features a lot of foul language and a lot of violence. Is there a big story behind it? No this is more about shooting cool stuff, explosions and quotes to take home.As a Greek I sort of almost wanted the villain to succeed. Of course not really because after all he is bad and evil, right? But it was nice to see a Greek bad guy for once - and very well established and sawn into the financial crisis and into general history. And while it is not an actual Greek playing that role (Papadopoulos or Papad..less as he is also called by Sam Jacksons character at one point), Antonio Banderas is not only a great actor who is great, he also learned or knew some Greek words he threw in there for good measure. Always a nice thing to hear that and while it may only be a minor detail, it is something that is much appreciated.Also his history with Salma Hayek makes this almost meta. Not to mention a cameo that I wasn\'t aware of, that has a funny scene with Samuel L. Jacksons character ... his voice may be one of the most recognizable ones ever.So this is case of style over substance ... but in a very good way.'""
""'Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek reprise their characters in this sequel to the action comedy The Hitman\'s Bodyguard (2017). In a rather more convoluted plot that adds Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman to the list of characters, this sequel does not really break any new ground, but does pull together the elements of action comedy in a bit splashier way and incorporates a decent dose of emotional backstories and somewhat more personal intimate scenes that add a nice balance to the action comedy. The threat to the European Union is quite a nice new spin on mass destruction. There are a few places where the movie threatened to become an unintended parody but pulled itself out with experienced acting. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable summer movie that offers a little mental attention to follow the plot and the relaxed luxury to join in the visual and auditory physical action, the light-heartedness, a few poignant moments and come out satisfied if not exuberantly and amazed.'""

""'Space Jam: A New Legacy is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a new version of Space Jam of 1996. Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of Space Jam I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that Space Jam: A New Legacy is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed.'""
""'After 25 years since Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes appeared together in Space Jam, another reboot or remake of the franchise was made in Space Jam: A New Legacy. It stars LeBron James, who tries to chase Michael Jordan in the GOAT (Greatest Of All-Time) conversation, just proves once again that he is not him on and off the court especially with poor acting unlike Jordan,who was clearly having fun in his role in the original.It was apparent the comparisons will be made compared to the first movie released in 1996. While the digital and visual effects are a lot better, it proves once again that LeBron does not have the marketing appeal that Michael has. That is why you see a lot of ads(from LeBron and Warner Bros) implied on the film and focused on it rather on the story it has.Well, this movie was released to capitalize on both stars being the best of their respective generation\'s NBA players. Too bad that this movie proves once again that LeBron is not comparable to Michael even off the court.Take note,I am not even a Jordan fan. Wilt Chamberlain is the true G. O. A. T (Greatest Of All-Time) in NBA History. Hands down. Not LeBron nor Michael.'""

This is the fifth film in the Purge franchise and a direct sequel to 2016's The Purge: Election Year.This one has ample amount of action but somehow the tension is missing.I still enjoyed it. The sun soaked settings added more fun n it was good to see Josh Lucas aft a long time.I was hoping for an exciting showdown in the end but alas.
""It's definitely derivative and it almost certainly has some issues with the choices it takes in the last 15 minutes, but The Little Things succeeds with tension, atmospheric creepiness, and the performance of Jared Leto. I think we all would have hoped for a little more from the 3 of these leads, but it still contains some fantastic cinematic moments.6.9/10.""
""Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best.""
""'Emma is a subtle comedy, delving into issues of marriage, sex, age, and social status. It was the last book of hers published while author Jane Austen was still alive. About the character Emma she said, preparing to write the novel, I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.Emma is 21 and privileged, she fashions herself as a matchmaker and most of the stories that develop result from this. It truly is a comedy of manners. Not slapstick comedy, the type of subtle British comedy.This movie pretty well follows the novel and Anya Taylor-Joy to me is just perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She is a good actress but I especially love to look at her face, with her wide-set eyes and perfect lips. Strangely after she was selected to play the role she was hesitant, she said she didn\'t think of herself as attractive enough. In fact in an interview she said, I have never and I don\'t think I will ever think of myself as beautiful. I don\'t think I\'m beautiful enough to be in films.Bill Nighy is very good as her wealthy father Mr. Woodhouse and as often happens when he has a supporting role, Nighy steals every scene he is in.Good movie of a familiar story, I enjoyed it. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.'""

""'Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and EmilyÃÂ´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?The Invisible Man is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): O Homem InvisÃ\xadvel (The Invisible Man)'""
""Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things.""

""Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in. Nomadland is a good movie, maybe not the happiest movie, but certainly food for thought.""
""It delivers. It doesn't limit itself to be just an action/drama/revenge film, it gives important lessons about choices, about relationships, about grief and about forgiveness.Once again, Mads Mikkelsen has a fantastic performance (that moment on the bathroom, god damn!) but all the supporting cast do a very good job.""
'Mads Mikkelsen is a Special Forces guy who returns home to Denmark after his wife is killed in a train accident. Two computer geeks meet up with a third and visit the very angry but not grieving widower. His teenage daughter is not dealing with the situation well either. Riders of Justice becomes a cross between Death Wish(with much better acting) and Boondock Saints. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Mads is perfect and the supporting cast superb with a surprisingly sarcastic script to accompany the necessary bloody violence. Trust me on Riders. It is one of my top three films of 2020.'

""Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told.""

The fictional biopic goes on the theme of 'women empowerment' and has delivered it quite convincingly. The casting is too good and everyone has given their best performance.

""'Religion figures prominently in this slice of American Gothic from Antonio Campos but it\'s the old time religion of the Old Testament rather than the New and it\'s the Devil who\'s in the driving seat in The Devil All the Time. Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it\'s a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We\'ve been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can\'t keep a good genre down. It meanders a little and jumps back and forth in time maybe more than it should and it\'s certainly overlong but it\'s well-acted, (particularly by Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland), and very nicely narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, author of the original novel.'""

""'I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for The Ice Road, I must admit that I wasn\'t exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in The Ice Road is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn\'t let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller.The Ice Road was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating The Ice Road a six out of ten stars.'""
""Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's fortÃÂ© lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers.""

Meanwhile, Marine lawyer Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is recruited to be the prosecutor to give the prisoner a death sentence. He is eager for the job after losing a close friend in one of the planes. Former classmate Neil Buckland (Zachary Levi) is involved with the interrogation.Director Kevin Macdonald delivers a clear-headed dissection of the case against Mohamedou who is known here as The Mauritanian. The power of this movie comes from a straight forward telling of his story. I am uncertain about portraying the torture but somehow it has to be laid down on film. I would consider a less direct approach to give the audience some space. There are a few lines of dialogue that I wish Nancy would say. The performances are beyond reproach. All in all, this is a powerful truth seeking missile of a film.""

""Love and Monsters is a strangely lighthearted post-apocalyptic story. And while the premise makes it sound like a low-budget TV movie, I was quite impressed with the visual effects and the overall production quality. Dylan O'Brien is a highly relatable protagonist, and this quirky creature flick had more heart than I expected. I think more people should know about this film.""
""Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work.""
""'I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.Of course every fun moment or any moment in general happening here can be taken and dissected. Even if it has so many wink wink moments - as in knowing what we expect and try to surprise us while also delivering on what we want to see. The story is predictable - but that does not stop this from being really entertaining from start to finish. Great actors round the whole thing up - actaully my first thought concerning a summary line was Maze Runner meets Iron Fist - ok so it may have been a stretch, especially because there is not really so much hand to hand combat here ... but would be relying more on the actors involved. Enjoyable to say the least! I wouldn\'t mind a sequel as well.'""

""'Co-helmed by the guy who wrote Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out and directed the latter 2, Soul is yet another amazing film. It goes deep, covering the nature of existence, the important of dreams and life, the need to find meaning. It goes funny, with crazy gags that leave you breathless. It goes visually stunning, with remarkable imagery. And the plot is constantly moving and shifting and surprising.Seriously, just watch it.'""
""If you've seen the original, you probably do not need to see this. I had no idea this was a remake when I watched this. But I had a strong feeling of Deja Vu. I was quite glad I had seen the original. Overall the first movie to go a certain place is better than a remake. Rule of the thumb or however the saying goes.This still can be a lot of fun. Yes it is CGI heavy, yes it isn't the best CGI ever and all that. But it can be fun to watch. Unless you are a witch and feel this is misrepresenting your way of life ... ok kidding aside (I hope that is a joke you say? Yes me too), some things may be considered offensive, but you could say similar things about the original too.A fun family film with some shockers in between - maybe not for the very small ones then.""
'3 out of 5 stars.The Witches is a fantasy thriller about a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Only to learn from her that witches exist. And they hate children. When the boy comes across a witch. Grandmother decides to take boy out on a getaway at a resort. Which conveniently a group of witches are hosting a convention. Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.Cute and fun film for the family. But cheesy cgi and visual effects makes the movie feel cheapily put together. The acting was also decent with the cast ensemble. The story also comes out short with barely anything to mention.'
""When Hero's (Jahzir Bruno) parents die in a car accent in Chicago,he is raised by Octavia Spencer, the world's greatest grandmother. Unfortunately a coven of witches led by Anne Hathaway are out to change kids into mice and curse them with the voice of Chris Rock. The main action takes place in a swanky hotel.It was a fun film. I can see kids liking it.""
""I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn.""
""This is the story of Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya ) who lead the Chicago branch. He had one too many bills. It is also the story of Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) the FBI informant who assisted in getting Fred assassinated by the FBI and Chicago Police. The story starts with Fred already as a leader and with Bill getting arrested and becoming an informant.I imagine the role of the traitor was a tough one for LaKeith Stanfield who came through as a reluctant informant. While the film touches on the black struggle, he is not weighed down with being preachy , just letting the facts speak for themselves.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.""

And both the cat and mouse take up shop in the luxury loft elegant hotel and their chases entertain! Wrapped around it all is a young lady and hotel lobby worker Kayla(Chloe Grace Moretz) as all become friends and learn about the ins and outs of life! The music score and scenes are well done as it even has avid fans thinking back to memories of the old classic Hanna Barbera days. In the end things stay the same with the classic chase rivals only it\'s live happily ever after for others. Good tribute and entertaining movie of the classic cat and mouse duo.'""
""Animation is so well done reminded me of Who Killed Roger Rabbit where the real world is mixed and they interact with the cartoons. Anyway I see why so many highly rated Tom and Jerry it's so lovable, heartwarming when Chloe Grace Moretz character says it's like they've been fighting years. I'm so happy there was more animation than you'd expect that's great for fans! Tim Story is very good at making feel-good films.""

""At one point in Bhoot Police, a character, addressing a crowd, advises them not to believe in the two tantric babas who have been hired to drive away the local chudail.

Yes, the climax could've been shortened a bit, but it's ok, I am already looking forward to this been made as a franchise of sorts. It could actually breathe some new life in the tired Bollywood Horror genre, which is none.Full credit to the director too.""

""I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills.""

""Due to the repetitive nature of time loop movies, they have to be done right in order to keep the audience engaged the whole time. Palm Springs does it right. This film does a great job of keeping things fresh. Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother. I wish this film were a little less vulgar, so it would be accessible to a broader audience, because I think more people should take a trip with Palm Springs.""
""'Funny movie with an interesting story. andy samberg is awesome. cristin milioti gives a beastly performance. good love story. (1 viewing, 2/24/2021)'""
""'For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, Groundhog Day, Palm Springs is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It\'s got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It\'s a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it\'s not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It\'s all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-'""
""Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times.""

I only went to see this film after seeing is score on imbd but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.There was plenty of action and a good plot. I didn't understand a lot of it but it was good fun.I would go again to see another film like this.
""I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one""
""This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D.""

We are given Dune sand monster w/footsteps on sand; above & below ground spider & web chase & entrapment; sand storm w/electrical discharge; dinosaurs (especially the rib cage scene reminds me of Pitch Black) & fire breathing dragons; flaming swords; 3 masted sand schooner; monolithic mysterious structure; Guardians raccoon equivalent cat; parallel world.

Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams Rahne (pronounced rain) but otherwise it\'s a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up.

""GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable.""
""For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment.""

""'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years?

The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought 'Run' was excellent.Would I watch it again? Yes.""
'Amanda is honestly so talented! The plot is great!'
Quite Alrite with old movie concept with adding new elements. It's a bit long and horror part not that advanced. But still good with the storyline.
""'8/10 - while I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a little underwhelming, this was all-in-all a captivating horror thriller that kept unraveling and peaking my curiosity.'""
'Michael Rianda joins animation royalty (Brad Bird et al) with one of the sharpest scripts in years.'
""It seemed boring, a family facing machines, the title sums it up and it doesn't help, but what a captivating family, it seems our family, maladjusted, crazy, but that everyone loves each other, special participation of that perfect, margarine commercial in the urge, but none surpasses ours, the adventures are wonderful, the perfect strips, super fun and exciting...""
'Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water Kepler drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity.'

""Sonic the Hedgehog - 3\nHuh. This movie actually wasn't that bad. Sonic the Hedgehog borrows heavily from other buddy road trip movies we've seen, and some of the characters' decisions don't make sense, but this is a harmless film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Also, my kids really enjoyed it. And seeing has how most video game adaptations are terrible, that makes this film adaptation one of the better ones.""
""Well it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The Sonic face was better it looked more similar with original game. The best part of movie are songs. Everything was a little bit too basic, jokes were lame, plot was meh.""
""Well made movie all around. very funny and fun. great pacing and kept me invested throughout.i already said it was very funny, but i need to specifically talk about jim carrey and the pure gold that is every scene he's in. his first scene in the movie had me crying, no exaggeration. it wasn't that hysterical for the rest of his scenes, but when he wasn't hilarious, he was so awesomely over the top. a perfect role for him, and a perfect casting choice since i can't imagine anyone else making such an outlandish character believable. jim carrey, you are the GOAT (1 viewing, 5/10/2020)""

When Sonic accidentally causes a power outage, the Pentagon calls up evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).The Sonic redesign is good. This is mostly fun. Jim Carrey is very weird which somewhat fits. I like Sonic and I like his chemistry with Marsden. I like the family. It's all somewhat good but nothing great. It doesn't have much of a plot. The last act is not that great. That makes this a good video game movie.""
""The film is part of a certain genre of lovable alien coming to Earth and being chased by unnecessarily evil and ineffective power hungry guys while being protected by regular people for emotional reasons. It checks all the boxes, it is funny and pleasant, too. The villain, while being the usual cardboard evil character, gets much more nuanced and interesting from Jim Carrey's performance. And frankly, I thought James Marsden was just a pretty face, but I kind of like him in everything he does so, good luck James!As a successful and fun to watch movie based on a game - they are too few and far between - I think this is way above the average. Maybe a bit too childish, though, but I guess this film isn't for adults.""

""'This film feels like Ferris Bueller joins the army. Then gets discharged and becomes a junkie. It has a quirky first-person narrative throughout the film with clever film editing and a added love interest for Bueller, cough Cherry (Tom Holland).'""
""Second movie in a row for me featuring Tom Holland. After Chaos Walking, that was quite enjoyable to me as a fantasy movie and that despite the low ratings it got, this time Cherry, a powerful movie about PTSD but mostly about addiction, heroin addiction to be more precise. Not as powerful as The Basketball Diaries but certainly good enough to keep you far away from heroin after watching it. Tom Holland just nailed it here, very good performance playing his character. Ciara Bravo also did a good job. The destructive relationship they are in, the issues that both have, it's all well filmed and keeps you interested in the entire story. A long movie but never boring. Good to excellent cinematography, great cast, great story, what else can you ask for? Again an underrated movie with Tom Holland.""
""Conceptually very strong, loved the characters and they have great chemistry. However, there's so much information trying to be conveyed that the main storyline gets lost. This would make for a great series but it's too much for a 2 hr movie. But great acting and the action choreography is intense.""
""It was interesting, I would even say something unique. Plot has some action,some adventures and history moments. Not sure about that plot hole when someone betrayals, it just doesn't make sense and lower quality of whole film. I would recommend to watch this movie for action lovers, I found it similar to Suicide Squad.""
'4 out of 5 stars.The second film was a bit of a letdown with its uneven direction. The third film does end the trilogy in a good slow direction that picks up in a bloody showdown third act. The film takes the characters back in 1666 to give an origin story of the witch. When a village of settlers in the town. Gets cursed and people starts pointing accusations towards girls who seem out of place. Without giving away spoilers. There is a twist which turns the film direction into a bloody third act. Where a few teens try to hold up in a place to face against a variety of killers while trying to kill the evil.Plot is good. The cast ensemble is good. It took awhile to get used to the same cast playing different characters in 1666 which felt weird at first. Especially the accents they were using. But the story keeps you engaged. The thrills is good. And the third act is bloody entertaining. The film holds back a soundtrack with spending more time on a music score.The film does give it a proper conclusion. While leaving a mid credit scene for more possibilities.'
""'Fear Street: 1666 is a Mystery - Horror movie and the third movie of the Fear Street franchise, in which we continue our journey in the past. We are now back on 1666 and we watch how all started and how the curse of Sarah Fier released.I enjoyed the third movie of this franchise the same way as the previous two. The plot continued to surprise me since there were some plot twists that I did not expect and made the movie even more interesting. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak who made also the direction for the previous two movies followed the same successful way. The interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Sarah Fier / Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Henry / Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Lizzie / Kate and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Hannah Miller / Samantha Fraser were for one more time very good. All in all, I have to say that Fear Street: 1666 and Fear Street franchise was simply amazing and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. I am sure that if you are a horror movies fan you will simply love this franchise.'""
""Which is an extraordinary achievement even in today's upside down world. The first in the trilogy was so good I sat through the second and third, parts of my life I will never get back. Whichever exec greenlighted this disaster should find a new line of work.""
""'I had only seen the first one, but I saw a review of the second one. Yes, it was the Nostalgia Critic who showed me that one. Anyway, this movie features Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter reprising their roles decades after the first movie. That deserves credit by itself. The plot features Bill and Ted saying that at 7:17pm of this night, they have to write the perfect song or else time will be destroyed. They go to themselves in the future when they make the perfect song.Like the first one, this relies mostly on creativity as its strong point. It really seemed like this didn\'t have that much on comedy as the other ones. It\'s still enjoyable, because it gets very creative. I will admit that it did get a little boring at times and even for a movie that\'s an hour and a half, it could have been shorter. The characters (and actors) are still likeable, which is another strong point. I\'m so glad to finally see a new movie released in theaters since Sonic The Hedgehog: The Movie! ***'""
""As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better. But I'm not going to complain, Greyhound was entertaining for me. If you like movies like Das Boot give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed.""
""'There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks (Capt. Krause) is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat wolf pack strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too Battleships at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written.'""
""Greyhound (4 out of 5 stars).Greyhound is a good war film that follows Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) as his ship escorts a group of cargo ships during WWII. Which they come across a nazi submarine that plays cat and mouse with them. As they battle to survive.This film is very fast paced. With very little to none on the character and story development. Occasionally having Krause having flashbacks of his wife played by Elizabeth Shue. The film is non stop action which you may have to buckle up for this wild ride. The plot is good. About Krause captaining Greyhound ship and trying to escort others.The direction does deliver a chaotic battle sequence. Putting you right in the crew's perspective with the action. As they see a sub ascending with a torpedo coming towards them or seeing a ship flashed from an explosion. The action is big, loud, and chaotic which you have to see on the big screen. The music score was great as it created that intense feeling and mood when a threat is near.I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks script which did not have any character development or characterization with anyone. The script is consist of crew members yelling out orders or demands on the ships actions. Which was thin and lacking for about anything else for a war movie.But it was one wild ride that will have you on the edge of your seat.""

Their daughter-in-law Lorna, with their grandson Jimmy, remarries to Donnie Weboy. The couple leaves town without telling the Blackledges. Margaret is desperate to find them. The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women.""

The only reason I didn\'t fall asleep, was Davidson\'s fine balance of pathos and humor throughout the film. His story was very relatable and he performed/portrayed it quite well. The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would\'ve been a real hit. Still, mad props to Davidson for telling his story so well. Too bad Apatow didn\'t write and direct it better.'""

""Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction.

Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie.

""And we're back into the 90s again, sort of. We do have a female lead though. And I don't mind the very predictable structure that much (feel free to disagreee here).

A shame almost, especially because a fight scene Malkovich has, seems more potent and lethal than most of the other stuff. And that is what an action movie should prioritize, shouldn't it? If you are more forgiving in that aspect, maybe the paper thin story will wring more out of this than for others.

""'Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one\'s home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you\'re in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn\'t a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil\'s Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it\'s about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of why don\'t they just leave? Easier said than done, it seems. Oh, and that one masked girl... Holy god.'""
""In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes. The cinematography isn't bad with interesting camerawork at times. As for the acting I thought the two major characters played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku were very believable in their roles. Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie.""
""Exploring themes of grief, trauma, immigration, assimilation, remorse & acceptance through a horror lens, His House is a haunting & harrowing depiction of the refugee experience and, in addition to capturing their inward & outward struggle in adjusting to new life in new place, also delivers as a thrilling & effective haunted house chiller.Written & directed by Remi Weekes, the film blends character drama & genre thrills into one finely layered narrative and holds nothing back when unleashing the terror that dwells within the walls of their new home. While there are times when the story becomes perplexing, everything adds up & makes sense once the full picture of the characters' backstory is revealed.The atmosphere within the rundown residence is palpably tense & often unsettling, and though Weekes relies on jump scares to frighten the viewers, most of them do work out in the film's favour. Wunmi Mosaku & Sope Dirisu play the young refugee couple seeking asylum after escaping their war-torn homeland, and they both chip in with performances that are credible, grounded & convincing.Overall, His House is a welcome entry in the world of horror and also marks a solid debut for Remi Weekes' directorial career. The proper care with which he sketches the characters' troubled past, vulnerable present & uncertain future, and brings it in sync with the immigrant issues gives his picture a relevant touch & relatable appeal. One of the better horror entries in Netflix canon, His House is certainly worth a shot.""
""Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers he has an illegitimate son in Queens who is to be his heir as his daughters can not rule by law. We first see the son (Jermaine Fowler) interviewing for a job with the son of one of the Duke Brothers (Trading Places). I am sure I missed some more homage stuff. Wesley Snipes plays the well dressed choreographed bad guy. The film is a who's who of black entertainment minus a few under contract to Netflix.The production was very funny. It speaks to woman's equality but not preachy and in that regard I wished they had developed the daughter more. The son was not what I expected. They had him as a techno geek and a small time ticket scalper, but neither one was ever used in the film. I would have expected some gut who was a street smart hustler, using those credentials to pass his tests.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity.""

Off he goes to fetch this young man Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler) and his larger than life mother Mary (Leslie Jones), brings them back to meet his all-female family in his Kingdom of Zamunda and all hell - accompanied by some horrific musical parodies of just about everyone from Gladys Knight to Nile Rodgers, with a bit of John Legend and Prince desecrated too - breaks loose. To be fair to Fowler, he is a good looking lad with some bemused attitudinal charm (particularly at bath-time), and there are some wonderful facial expressions from JEJ as he awaits death/relief from his coffin, but the rest of this just misfires on a pretty much continuous basis.

I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't.""
If you compare this movie to the original it will feel less unique and may seem more deja vu. Of course it's a a chase movie with zombies. In that sense it has a Terminator feel. Things start off with an interesting premise - go back to get the cash since Zombies don't want money. Some faults. One thing I didn't like was the game where they fed humans to the zombies. Unnecessary. Also making them fight other bad humans was irritating. A lot of the movie is at night.\nThe good points are the ending wasn't irritating. No one likes too much self sacrifice. Kang Dong Won looks quite suitable in this role surprisingly. In the past he seemed not quite hero looking for action but here he is good. Lee Jung Hyun is quite a good heroine too.\nOkay for what it is. More conventional and less unique than the first movie. I prefer #Alive. But still an entertaining enough watch.
""Hollywood likes to portray Hollywood, like the narcissistic city that it is, and so from time to time you get these high budget, grand cast extravaganzas that do nothing but explain their place of origin. Mank is a black and white ode to the 30's Hollywood era, all wrapped around a conspiracy theory core. You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present. You need to watch it even if only to see that fake news is not something new to 2020. It may be a little too presumptuous, a little self absorbed, but a good film nonetheless. I am sure it's better if you know what the hell it is referring to, though.""
""'Honest Thief is built around the conceit that bank robber Tom Dolan has found the perfect woman that leads him to renounce the world of crime and turn in the $9 million that he stole as the notorious In and Out Bandit.The woman is Annie Wilkins whom Tom meets while renting a couple of units to hide his loot at a self-storage site. The best scene in the film was the first encounter of Tom and Annie. The banter was lively and the chemistry apparent. That scene really jump-started the film.Tom\'s noble plan to make a deal with the feds goes awry when a couple of corrupt FBI agents attempt to steal the money, kill their supervisor, and blame the crime on Tom. Yet, like Don Quixote, the intrepid bank robber continues in his quest to make amends and cut a deal.The film was crisply directed with a lively pace and excellent location filming. The love theme was carefully balanced with the action sequences, and the result was a combination of heist film, thriller, and romance. Liam Neeson was outstanding in the role of Tom Dolan. Best supporting actor goes to Tazie the dog.While there may not be anything innovative about the film, the bottom line was that this was an entertaining synthesis of tropes from other action pictures with a standout central character of a thief with a heart.'""
""'Liam Neeson is the In and out bandit, robbing banks for years. He hasn\'t been caught, but when he meets the right lady, he decides it\'s time to give himself up; he tries to return the cash, but it doesn\'t go as planned.

He finally comes clean with Annie, but can he work things out before the FBI takes him out? It\'s fun. One of the two films directed by Mark Williams. Story by Steve Allrich and Mark Williams.'""
'3 out of 5 stars.Shadow in the Cloud is a fair action horror film about Chloe Grace Moretz character hitching a ride on a plane with a few soldiers. Needing to deliver a secret package in her luggage. While in the air they face against some gremlin like creature that is destroying the plane and fighting against other enemies that is attacking them in the air.Mix mash plot with a few cat and mouse fight with WWII air battles. Some horror thrills with a creature destroying there plane. While Chloe is locked in a gun cockpit.The script is cheesy with annoying irritating characters. And the dialogue is boring which makes you lose interest in whats going on.Chloe Grace Moretz is awesome in the role. Taking on an action role. The action is pretty decent and entertaining. It can be cheesy. The visual effects are cheesy too.'
""3 astronauts arrive at a space station to find a badly injured, unconscious 'stowaway' on board. The implications of having this additional person on board soon become clear.Whilst there are some really quite exciting parts in this film and a convincing / fascinating take off and docking, this is not your average space thriller. Instead it is a relatively gently insight into how professional people cope in extraordinary circumstances, leading to a pleasant albeit not wholly unpredictable ending. Not at all bad with a solid enough cast, it remains watchable if unremarkable.""
""Undermined by leaving some big questions unanswered and a frustratingly abrupt ending, Stowaway is still a really good sci-fi drama that's emotional, engaging and tense. Anna Kendrick, Toni Collette, Daniel Dae Kim and Shamier Anderson are all incredible with excellent chemistry. Joe Penna's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The visual effects are impressive and the music by Volker Bertelmann is great.""

""Dame Kristin Scott Thomas follows in the footsteps of Dame Judith Anderson and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers.Unfortunately Armie Hammer has to follow Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Brett and Charles Dance. Well let's say that unlike Dance who was too old for the role.

She finds that her naivety is exposed by Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper who was hopelessly devoted to Rebecca, the first Mrs de Winter who died in a tragic boating accident about a year before.It is a beginning of mind games between the two characters while Maxim seems to be haunted himself by Rebecca.Director Ben Wheatley has form with low budget English folk horror films. He also directed Peter Capaldi's feature length debut story of Doctor Who.With the help of a Netflix budget. Wheatley focuses more on the courtship in the South of France. There is a folk song played as the couple travel to Manderley which I thought will lead to an eerie Gothic atmosphere.There is a more lesbian subtext regarding Mrs Danvers and her infatuation with Rebecca.Somehow this is rather old fashioned. It is better than the 1997 ITV mini series but I expected more of Wheatley's own stamp.""
""#ALIVE is a South Korean film with a very simplistic and familiar presence - a young man hides out in his apartment during a zombie apocalypse - that some have linked to the French indie THE NIGHT EATS THE WORLD. But then it is a very generic kind of premise that I had the idea of writing myself a decade or so ago. In any case, films like this live or die depending on the execution, and the good news is that #ALIVE is a winner thanks to plenty of hard work on the part of the director, who wrings maximum suspense, humour and action from that premise. It's fast-paced and engaging, saddled with an annoying but realistic lead who grows on you as the story progresses, and a great female supporting character. The zombies are the scary ones you'll remember from TRAIN TO BUSAN and KINGDOM, making this all the more gripping.""
""This film exceeded my expectations tbh. It was suspenseful, thrilling amd never really ends up boring because of the fast pace. Absolutely smart with the technology-style but could've use more of that.""

""Fatherhood is a 2021 Netflix/Columbia Pictures Comedy Drama starring Kevin Hart,Melody Hurd,Deborah Ayorinde and Alfre Woodard. Directed by Chris Weiz(who was\nthe writer for About A Boy) and based on a novel by Matthew Logelin titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir Of Loss and Love. The story is about Matthew Logelin(Hart) an African American who's been with his wife Liz(Deborah Ayorinde) since they were kids. However when Matt's wife is pregnant and has to go under a C Section for her baby,tragedy strikes when Liz dies leaving Matt heartbroken as he is left to rear his daughter Maddy(Melody Hurd) on his own without a mother figure for his child. While struggling with Maddy,Matt later meets a woman named Swan(DeWanda) and he strikes a relationship with her. But is he moving too quick or will he learn the challenges of being a single parent as well as facing obstacles along the way?Alot of people may be baffled as to why they cast an African American for Matt Logelin instead of a Causcian but I didn't pass any remarks on the casting for this film.Kevin Hart was very good in this film(he also served as a producer too with Chris Weiz), as I am so used to seeing him as the wise cracking buddy of Dwanye Johnson and being typecast in alot of his films.I've always loved Kevin Hart so that's why I watched it. If your a fan of Kevin Harts do check it out on Netflix.B.""
""'Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the all falls apart felt forced and wasn\'t necessary.'""
""This movie stars a very fine actor who looks remarkably like the comedian Kevin Hart. In fact, he looks so much like Hart that the producers have tried to pass him off as Hart - no doubt to capitalize on Hart's popularity. I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut. This movie is not always easy to watch. But it is impossible to stop watching.If you don't like Kevin Hart's previous movies - and I didn't care for some of them - watch this. You will be amazed. If you did like his previous movies, watch it as well. You will also be amazed. It's an amazing movie.""
""Yet another spin on superheros, 'Project Power (2020)' posits a world in which a new drug allows users to unleash their inner power - whatever it may be - for five minutes a pop. It's an interesting premise that, essentially, takes a traditional action-thriller and sprinkles some of the oh-so-popular superhero genre on top. It may sound cynical, but it doesn't feel it. It's generally an enjoyable time, despite its uneven tone and somewhat vague plot. It also has a few stand-out set-pieces which are approached in rather unique ways, such a hectic fight sequence that's only seen from inside a giant tank. The leads all do a good job with the material - though, Gordon-Levitt seems to think he's in a comedy - and the pacing is always tight enough to maintain engagement. It isn't going to get you thinking - in fact, you'll probably notice some plot problems if you do - but it should keep you entertained. 7/10""
""'Project Power is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ex-soldier, a police officer and a teenage dealer trying to stop a group of people from delivering a pill that gives to users unpredictable powers. They have to cooperate and trust each other if they want to succeed.I found this movie interesting but not something amazing or new since there are plenty Sci-Fi movies which have to do with superpowers and a way of gaining those. The interpretations of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Frank and Jamie Foxx who played as Art were good and the combination of them worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Dominique Fishback who played as Robin. All in all, I have to say that Project Power is a nice movie to spend your time with but if you are about to watch it, I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed by it.'""
More CGI than I was expecting but the CGI was really good. Not too surprising as they are doing man's best friend and they have it down packed.

Instead they used state of the art motion capture to generate realistic animation for the animals. This is covered quite nicely in a series of making of extras on the movie disc.Harrison Ford, almost 80 now, is very effective as the narrator and the old prospector that befriends Buck.

The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10.""

""It's all highly cinematic (and exaggerated to an extent) and it's clichÃÂ©s galore in the characterization department, yet Happiest Season is a film that leaves you emotionally fulfilled. It follows the formula but adds ample doses of heart, making everything magically work. In this film, you'll witness brilliant performances from Kristen Stewart and Dan Levy. Their friendship (more than the film's core lesbian love story) is what stands out as a truly memorable story arc. The thing about the Caldwell household is that nearly everyone's got something to hide, and that makes it a little easier for writer-director Clea DuVall to collectively provide closure to their issues.Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart share decent chemistry as a queer couple. But I've gotta say those few scenes that featured Aubrey Plaza and Stewart make you feel like they had some totally untapped chemistry. That's for another film to tackle, I guess. Happiest Season is tonally all over the place, oscillating between wacky comedy and genuinely emotional moments. And as a Christmas flick, Happiest Season isn't technically the 'happiest' though it manages to get there eventually (after a lot of misery!). It's an enjoyable 100-minutes alright!""
""Happy couple Stewart and Davis go to Davis' parents for Christmas which is full of tradition, snobbery, family disagreements, old lovers and the father trying to get the nomination for Mayor. The real issue though is that Davis tells Stewart before they arrive that she hasn't told her parents she's gay, so Stewart reluctantly has to pretend to be her hetrosexual flat mate.As a drama about being yourself and understanding everyone's trial of life it works quite well. It is though supposed to be a comedy as well with Stewart and catty mum, Steenburgen both on good form. The comedy though switches off half way through and it all becomes pure drama, missing a number of opportunities. A well made festive drama with good performances all around, it's just that the balance is rather off kilter.""

""What worked:\nSo what makes Mimi a great watch is an almost balanced perspective regarding the dilemma that appears at the last act of the movie. Of course it's an tearjerker at times with the execution but keeping the hopes alive, decoding them, and giving just reasonings for the perspective makes it an alive, scholar and beautiful watch. Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal\nWhat did not work:\nThere were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended.""
This movie has a great message. And first time I liked kriti's acting. As always pankaj is amazing. And all the actors did an amazing job. And above all music and background score by AR Rahman is Best. A must watch.

They both start the movie believing that women are useless animals who should be kept in cages, but exposure to America gives Tutar an interesting story arc. Along the way we meet debutantes, conspiracy theorists, and a mix of lovely and awful people (who are sometimes the same people!).The movie is hilarious and utterly insane. Check it out!""

Yes, i laughed and loudly every now and then but nowhere near as often as I thought I would. Still, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, to give it its short title, (and that title in itself reeks of desperation), is still worth seeing thanks to a brilliant, star-making turn from Maria Bakalova as Borat\'s daughter, Tutar.The very thin excuse for a plot has Borat revisiting America with said daughter in tow and a plan to offer her as a gift to VP Mike Pence, (yes, that\'s about as original as it gets). Needless to say, Pence isn\'t interested though his appearance does mark one of the film\'s few inspired moments so the sights are set on Rudy Giuliani who is either even dumber than we thought or a rather good sport for going along with it. The candid-camera style sequences still work but much of this looks rehearsed and the wonderful Miss Bakalova deserves better. Will she deserve the Oscar should she win? Probably not but I can certainly see a long future ahead of her.'""
""'Upfront, I think it\'s fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson J.D. (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it\'s parts.'""

Just as a certain type of person used to enjoy those John Wayne Westerns with ALL punches pulled, what\'s there NOT to appreciate about a horror movie in which EVERY bit of foreshadowing and gore might turn out to be figments of someone\'s dream (either yours, or the film crew\'s)? So as the old witch is slowly incinerated at the end, pinned to the wall of her killing room, who can say that this scene is any more horrible than a piece of wood burning during one of those Yule Log DVDs?'""
""This 2020 horror film stars Sophia Lillis, Sam Leakey and Alice Krige based on the Grimm Fairytale. This dark version of the classic tale tells about teenage girl, Gretel (Lillis) who takes care of her younger brother, Hansel (Leakey). Soon, they stumble onto a mysterious house in the woods where an old woman, Holda (Krige) dwells. She welcomes them and provides plenty of food in exchange for them doing chores, but Gretel discovers that Holda is not whom she seems. This is an eerie flick with a decent cast, some creepy settings and a chilling score. You could give this a view if you're into supernatural horror or scary stories.""

""I watched the movie this morning and I put a review with a mixed response. Later, I realised that there are so many beautiful moments in this movie which I just can't forget and I realised that it's a pretty good movie than what I wrote in the first review. So I deleted it and I'm writing again. ATBP is far from perfect but the makers made sure that it's a pretty good YA romance. The performances are top notch and I'm a Elle Fanning fan way before. She gave a powerful and very good portrayal of Violet. Justice Smith also did a good job and he's good in emotional characters. Other than Elle Fanning, the best thing I liked in this movie is the music. The music is so sweet and mind blowing and will be in your mind for a long time and it's an integral part of the moving of the movie. The cinematography is also good and they have captured the places they go well beautifully. The movie starts so well and I liked the first half much better than the second. The setting up was so good upto their first kiss and after that the movie slows a bit. Overall, ATBP is a good, watchable movie. Some people may find it boring because it's slow in some parts but looking back at the final product, I'm more than satisfied.""
""Don't get me wrong. the book was good. This just added more visual and emotion in my opinion as they were all well casted with actors that made the emotions come to life.To those who believe that in the movie we didn't find out about Fitch's mental instability until late, you clearly were not watching the signs right form the begining.7.3""
""'After Cassius Clay (Eli Goree ) defeats Sonny Liston (Aaron D. Alexander ) he has an after party with Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge ), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr., and no women. Malcolm X is a real party-poop and puts a dampener on everything wanting to talk about how evil white people are, while looking over his shoulder. All of the characters weigh in on the race issue. Cooke and Brown agree it is economic empowerment. Malcolm X draws a hard solid line. You are either for or against. And Ali is all about Ali.The fictional conversations were interesting and most likely more meaningful than the ones they really had that night. Well done.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'""
""'Obviously a labour of love for Oscar-winning actress Regina King, One Night in Miami is her film version of Kemp Powers\' play about a night in which Malcom X, Mohammed Ali, (or Cassius Clay as he was back then), Sam Cooke and Jim Brown got together in a Miami hotel room discussing their lives as well as the struggle for civil rights. It\'s fiction, of course, and could have been painfully theatrical but King opens it up beautifully and draws superb performances from the whole cast with Leslie Odom Jr\'s Sam Cooke, (surely the Oscar is his to lose) and Aldis Hodge\'s Jim Brown the stand-outs.Indeed it\'s very much an actor\'s piece and if the ground covered has already been covered elsewhere, this is material well worth repeating and as a piece of history that might have happened but didn\'t it provides much to ponder over. It\'s also hugely entertaining, funny and whip-smart, and by the time we get around to Cooke\'s rendition of A Chage is Gonna Come there won\'t be a dry eye in the house.'""
""I don't really like these works, assumptions of what it would have been like if it had happened, but the type of film needed, to never forget how evil we can be, a heavy film, racism hurts, in the little unfortunate comments, in the acts, in the looks, but the debate / clash of Malcolm X vs Sam Cooke was worth it, it was reflective, about success and investment, pleasing the whites or making a profit through them, emblematic, excellent production of what may have been that illustrious night... Beautiful, sad and tragic...""
""'An old school sit down drama where 4 actors battle it out for who has the best monologue and who can have the best reactions to said monologue? I\'m in. But in all seriousness, there\'s something so impressive about the way Regina King directs this tight what if? drama about the possibility that Malcom X, JIm Brown, Muhammed Ali, and Sam Cooke all hung out and discussed life one night. No matter what really happened, this film happened, and it was fantastic.8.4/10.'""
""I'm really surprised by the relatively low ratings this movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what people expect nowadays from movies like this one? A movie based on a true story, but most of all an incredible story, very well written and directed by Francis Annan, clearly someone who knows how to build a tension with just minimalistic elements in the plot. I sat at the edge of my seat for some parts of this very enjoyable movie. The cast was also great, with a Daniel Radcliffe that proves again that he evolved from Harry Potter to an all round actor. He can play about anything and he did a great job again. To me Escape From Pretoria is definitely going to end in my top ten movies of this year. If you're a fan of escape movies then you surely won't be disappointed by this one. It belongs in the list of great prison escape movies, and it's based on true events what makes it always better. The negative critics on here have no clue about good movies, just ignore them and give this one a shot, you won't regret it.""
""'Escape from Pretoria will never win any Oscars but this heartfelt, social-conscious thriller, based on a true story and set in a South Africa under Apartheid, is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. As the title tells us, it\'s an escape movie, (obviously), and by their very nature, escape movies usually make for good thrillers and this is no exception. It\'s very exciting while not afraid to show the horrors of the South African prison system at the same time.Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber are the two young white members of the ANC imprisoned for distributing anti-government propoganda and Francis Annan\'s film is about how they escaped from Pretoria Prison. Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It\'s a very compact little movie though it\'s unlikely to cause Bresson\'s A Man Escaped, The Shawshank Redemption or Papillion cause for concern. That said, this is still edge-of-the-seat stuff, very skillfully done, and the performances throughout are first-rate. In the end, you might just say, it does what it says on the tin.'""
'I like the bit where they made all them keys out of wood.'
""A solid prison escape movie that supplies plenty of suspenseful moments and a fresh escape plan you can easily get behind. I found that it at times had a creative use of cinematography, and the score was suitably disturbing, somewhat similar to Psycho. Daniel Radclifffe really dissapeared into this role too; I was impressed.The film isn't astonishing or anything, but it's a job well done considering it's the first film from the director. Worth the watch if you're looking for some more new releases.""

John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible with fantastic chemistry. Sam Levinson's direction is really good, it's beautifully filmed and well paced. The black and white aesthetic choice really works and the soundtrack is excellent.""
""Yes day is a comedy family drama that shows what it will be like if parents were to allow their kids to have a day where they can't say no anything they ask, well of course there are some exception. This film looks nice, especially the suitably picturesque location work and the photography is never too drab or garish. The acting performance was pretty good; Jennifer Gardner was clearly having fun with her role as a strict yet lively mother of not one but three kids. Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart. It also didn't seem as cheesy or as sappy, or at least it didn't go too far on them, as other family drama films. Although the story is admittedly very predictable and has a lot of cliches, both deliberate choices with both being two things that the film is poking fun at, it for the last two acts is full of energy and charm.""
'Typical family movie with family values and lessons of life. Definitely worth the watch with younger children.'

The comedy elements work, the romantic storyline feels relatively authentic by teen movie standards, and the feminist message is well executed and powerful.The characters were all well done. Some were a little over the top and on the nose and I think it would have been interesting to bring in a few more male characters to explore more subtle instances of sexism and micro aggressions, but this is a relatively small criticism all things considered. The cast were all pretty solid, particularly the central performance of Vivian.The direction from Amy Poehler was great, carrying a great tone and style throughout the film.

Andrea Riseborough is the new cop in town who sets about getting to the bottom of the mystery. It's not an awful film, it's just neither scary nor funny.

""'How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It\'s a relatively straightforward story of an hunter Goodfellowe who, along with his young daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young Mebh (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young Robyn and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who\'s angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live...'""
""'I saw Wolfwalkers, starring the voices of Honor Kneafsey-the A Christmas Prince movies, Miss You Already; Eva Whittaker-in her first theatrical movie; Sean Bean-Jupiter Ascending, Game of Thrones_tv and Simon McBurney-The Conjuring 2, Mission:Impossible_Rogue Nation.This is an animated movie about an Irish folk tale. In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it\'s not just one long tale-with the other two being \'The Secret of Kells\'_2009 & \'Song of the Sea\'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It\'s rated PG for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.'""

I actually quite enjoyed this. It has an authentic, almost bakelite, style to it - and that helps sustain quite a suspenseful sci-fi drama with the odd twist in the tail - and an alien that is a little more creatively designed that the usual bug-eyed nonsense. There is an half-decent sense of jeopardy as the look of the film, too - dark and dingy - helps generate an extra bit of menace. Certainly, it is a cannibalisation of a great many films that have come before; but that doesn\'t make it awful - indeed, though basic in it\'s premiss, the production standards are quite high and it sends a salutary signal to Hollywood that their days of producing derivative, old hat, sci-fi will have to change if they want to keep ahead of the game...'""
""'Greetings from Lithuania.Sputnik (2020) was a very good sci-fi movie. It reminded me heavily of Alien and Arrival.

The place and time is 1983 and its Soviet Union - setting of sci-fi movie you simply won\'t see anytime soon. And this movie kept my attention during its whole 1 h 50 min. Its not just a monster flick - like i said the whole wibe of this movie reminded me heavily of Arrival - you kinda feel that there is more to it then it shows. Acting by two leads Oksana Akinshina & Fedor Bondarchuk were amazing in my opinion. Music at the end was haunting and directing of the whole thing was the thing that kept it going.Overall, Sputnik is a very good sci-fi / horror gem set in a very unique place and time. It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - Alien and Arrival - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked Sputnik on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb.'""
'3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.'
""I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10.""

Now fair to say and as you can tell by the rating at the moment (which I matched), that most think they did not meet that standard by a longshot.Having said, the cast is not bad at all. The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this. But the cocky teenager that is fron and center here does not bode well, even if he has some good points he\'s making.

""'This film was much needed on the quarter-century anniversary of the massacre of Srebrenica, one of the most bloody pages of the most recent european wars, the Jugloslavian conflicts, that happened so recently yet are unspoken of.Zbanic\'s film is better described as a family drama that happens to be set during Srebrenica than a film about Srebrenica alone. Or better, it is a film that is able to portray the events of Srebrenica yet focus on the personal story of a handful of characters.The main character, Aida, is an interpreter for the UN military unit that was sent to Srebrenica in 1995, and is determined to save his all-male family from the butchery of their invaders. Her character is the center of virtually everything that is depicted, and allows to give a wide glimpse at the most recent genocide occured on european soil. While several of the main characters are invented, they interact at various points with really existing people: Mladic, the butcher of Bosnia, colonel Karremans of the UN military division, among others.One element which I found relevant was how the film underlined the fact that the post-jugoslavian conflicts were a conflict between neighbours, between people who belonged to the same communities, and the epilogue depicts this in a most shocking way.'""

I love this particularly slow and mellow directing style though, because it gives the characters in this story room to breath and be real persons. So many comedies are only eager to score with making blunt jokes, but this is more of a subtle melancholic comedy/portrait, with real persons, with real life insecurities.

'Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day. I did not think this was Spike Lees best movie. But it was entertaining. I did have issues with how long the movie was. It was overlong and needed some editing to help with the pacing.'
""'Da 5 Bloods is a Drama - Adventure movie in which we watch five veterans returning to Vietnam in order to find and retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader.

The direction which was made by Spike Lee was very good and I believe that he did a great job on combining some dramatic moments with action. He also did something that I have not watched in any other movie, he kept the same actors to play in some flashbacks without making them look younger, something that I found very interesting and new. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Stormin\' Norman and it was one of his last interpretations. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clarke Peters\' who played as Otis, Delroy Lindo\'s who played as Paul and Isiah Whitlock Jr. who played as Melvin.

You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.Aimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through 'Breaking Bad' at this point in his career, also appears.'Prom' may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable.""

They have to change their behaviors and truly help the girl if they want to change as persons.I liked this movie because it presented very well a serious social topic from different perspectives while it consisted of some sarcastic scenes about celebrities and famous people in general. The interpretations of both Meryl Streep who played as Dee Dee Allen and James Corden who played as Barry Glickman were very good and they both did a very good job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jo Ellen Pellman\'s who played as Emma Nolan and Keegan-Michael Key\'s who played as Principal Tom Hawkins and they were equally good. To sum up, I have to say that The Prom was not exactly what I was expecting but I have to admit that was good and I recommend everyone to watch it.'""
""A cute action comedy that hit all the notes. The cast had great chemistry and the comedy landed. The storyline was fairly predictable, but it didn't need to be more than it was. Truly enjoyable.""
""I was looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres. Becoming a huge fan of Dave Bautista, The actor so I actually could not wait to see this family friendly picture.\nIt seems almost mandatory that a ex-wrestler needs to star in a family friendly movie , especially if Bautista wants an acting career as big as the Rock (who did Tooth Fairy) John Cena (Who just did Paying with Fire) or dare I say it...Hulk Hogan (Every movie he ever starred in).I won't spoiled the movie for you, because I don't have to. We've all seen this movie so many times that you already know the Spoiler Alert just by watching the trailer.Typical tough-as-nails action hero type being soften by his awkward interaction with a smart aleck little girl (it usually is a girl).I will say that Bautista does bring his own flavor to the formula and despite telling the same jokes over and over again, he's not bland. Plus his chemistry with the little girl is good. Makes it a feel good movie.It's also a fun movie. Lots of laughs and very exciting, just like a wrestling match, so it works that one of the best wrestlers in the biz is the star of it.""

I actually was extremely annoyed by her and thought she was trying to make him decide on his best friend or her.\nSecond, Elle and Noah. Their relationship was a mess but the chemistry was on point this time around. I felt myself liking them a lot more, which is funny since they broke up in real life when filming this. The whole situation with a Chloe and Marco was just a disaster and nothing is really explained. It definitely felt like something was missing. Noah's facial expressions were not matching with what he was saying at all.\nThird, Lee and Elle barely had any screen time together. I wanted to see more friendship moments with the two of them.\nAnd lastly, I didn't feel it with the new cast. Marco and Elle I was just not liking at all. I mean clearly he was the better guy but I just didn't feel any chemistry. Chloe was flirting way too much with Noah. It was honestly disgusting.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the real life situations being used on this movie.""
""Somehow the first film was under my radar. Elle (Joey King ) spends the entire summer before her senior year in High School having premarital sex with her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi ) before he leaves for Harvard. Elle then spends too much time with Lee (Joel Courtney) which causes drama with Lee's girlfriend, Noah has a hot female friend at Harvard which causes teen angst and Elle has a hot dance partner which upsets Noah. The drama was comical for a guy my age, but I am certain the teen ladies ate it up.Not for me. Let me know when Joey King gets her nose fixed.""

""Inspired by true events The Banker shows how in a not that distant past black people just didn't have the same rights and opportunies as white people. Nowadays there is some progress made even though there are still a lot of people that will judge people just by the color of their skin and that without knowing the person. There always will be people that base their judgement of somebody by the color of their skin, racism is for dumb people and dumb people we will always have. That said this story is worth to be told, and definitely helped in giving everybody, no matter what race or religion you belong to, a chance to have equal opportunities and rights to make money or to live where you want. Great job from Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast, excellent acting from their part. George Nolfi made this movie most enjoyable to watch. The movie deserves a high rating and certainly doesn't deserve negative reviews.""
""'The Banker is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the real story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who built their business empire by hiring a white man pretending to be the head of their businesses.I liked this movie very much because it was based on a simply amazing true story. The direction which was made by George Nolfi, it was very good and I liked very much that in the end of the movie showed us real photographs of the real people. The interpretations of both Samuel L. Jackson who played as Joe Morris and Anthony Mackie who played as Bernard Garrett were very good and I was really surprised by the interpretation of the last. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Nicholas Hoult\'s who played as Matt Steiner. To sum up, I have to say that The Banker is a nice movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it because everyone needs to know about this story.'""
""'Based on a true story, The Banker is the interesting tale of achievement against great odds. Bernard Garrett is a young and ambitious black man in mid 20th-Century America. Intelligent and driven, he moves to Los Angeles and plans on succeeding in the real estate business. He meets Joe Morris, a successful local black businessman whose loquacious and flippant personality couldn\'t be more in contrast to Garrett\'s stiff and nerdy character. After facing inevitable resistance in getting started Garrett overcomes his intitial dislike of Morris and resumes communication with him. The two strike a deal of purchasing properties around the city and decide on using Matt Steiner, a white colleague of Garrett when the latter was working a menial job as a handyman as a front while calling the shots behind the scenes. Events go swimmingly well for the men as success and wealth are for them to be had. After a visit back home to Texas Garrett decides to buy the bank in his hometown. That\'s when things start to get interesting. Featuring good acting and an in depth glimpse into the banking world the movie is an effective observation and critique on history, finance, race, gender and friendship. Simple and watchable, The Banker is solid history and filmmaking that touches on timeless topics inherent in the human experience.'""
""'The banker is a film that starts quality cast,mackie was always actor that was more for comedys and mcu guy,but here he give one very good performance maybe the best i seen him in,samuel l jackson was again enterteining and most fun to watch of all three actors,while hoult maybe overshadowed he still give solid performance,banker isnt special film by any means,it has stories that are been explored before and some of its repiptivnes was tiresome in scenes,but i can also say that this movie was good as its material was,and that is film biggest praise,if you watch you wont get something astonishing but you could still have good time'""

It is about keeping women in their place, obedient and voila! you get bliss.""
""I knew nothing about this film before watching it except that it sexualised children. However I wanted to know what the hulla baloo was about because Hollywood has been sexualising them for years.\nAs it turns out i think this is a fantastic film with a really strong message that the overly dramatic and faux moralistic brigade will have missed because they don't think further than a Sun headline.\nI could talk all night about how this film simply shows in very clear terms what society is doing to our kids, but the ones who need to listen won't.\nIf you want this type of film, which reflects real life, to stop, then stop Rihanna who's very highly sexualised moves has inspired young pre teen girls for years. Stop Rihanna, stop Miley Cyrus, stop all of the people who basically sell their sex and inspire ever younger children to emulate them.\nThis film does not sexualise young girls, it shows how the world is sexualising pre teens. If you want to find fault find fault there.""

Too sweet and teen for this one. I keep my patience to watch this for 30 minutes and can't last til the end. The background just sooo sweet and girly which I'm not the target audience. But the quality of this upholds certain movie standards and can tell it's well planned.
""'What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han To All The Boys I\'ve Loved Before. While not as strong as the first movie, this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean\'s romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean\'s) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey\'s wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn\'t delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter\'s relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine\'s tribute!'""

The next 30 the emotional side.I have seen the English version as well. The bollywood version fell short of 25 minutes. It created doubt. To add further we even have songs. But then trust me quality was not compromised.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The execution is precise. The couple along with other actors and filming locations look great.Music: The song maskhari is played along twice, the first time it hits the right notes. Second time however it is played when emotions run downside, trying to cheer. Overall even after coming from Rahman music was average.Acting: Sushant stood exception. All others were justified.Final Verdict: A story which promises balanced destiny and maybe a good afterlife if we see the bigger picture accompanied with faith. It's a top notch romance one must not miss.""
""It's rather difficult to review Dil Bechara (My Helpless Heart) in the aftermath but from an objective view, it only manages to engage you with its fabulous music, the lively lead and supporting performances, and the camera work. It is evident that the film was bludgeoned in the editing to make it appropriate but it still retrieves the melodramatic pulp which will make it a much more emotional and touching watch for early millennials. For everyone else, it's touchy-feely with overenthusiastic characters working on a plot that has been said and told numerous times now. But still there's something delightful in Dil Bechara that reignites the magic of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars that the Hollywood adaptation lacked. TN.""

Suirya's acting, by default, was again great.Now, when you create a movie you tend to put some masala, unnecessary churns, villainous events, and emotions; otherwise, how can you showcase it to the audience. The same falls for biopics. I will say for sure that this movie can't be 100% ture, but again, for me what valued most after watching it was inspiration and motivation.

""Aktar is convincing as the rugged henchman turned into a boxer.His moves in the ring are genuine and he never fails to impress with his physical transformation.His talent as a subtle actor makes the already dramatic movie yet more realistic n he naturally blends the violent goon turned into a civilized boxer who is madly in love with his wife.This may be a movie about boxing but I was mostly in awe by the potrayal of the prejudices n biases against a particular community, most filmmakers n actors lacks the courage to show the harsh realities plaguing the diverse n amazing India.The movie has fascinating economic and cultural underpinnings.Director Rakesh Mehra continues to blow us away with his direction. The guy knows how to reinvent genres and do things in new and interesting ways.One repeated effect that I really enjoyed was the way the director handled the boxing choreography.Most of the reviewers who gave negative ratings n reviews are the fascist bigots who all are jealous.I am 101 percent sure that the fascist bigots who gave negative reviews and ratings are jealous cos they don't have good physiques, they have short and flaccid assets.""

""It's 1995 Ohio.

It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether.""
""'Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in San Francisco. Katy refers to herself as the Asian Jeff Gordon. After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng\'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death. If you love what Marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after Thanos, then this is must see.'""
""'This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who\'s a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn\'t get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from Iron Man 3, played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It\'s a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there\'s two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It\'s still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary The Problem With Apu even more idiotic. ***1/2.'""
""'A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)\'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series\' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in Diamonds Are Forever was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in Casino Royale, making its appearance in Spectre its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than Quantum of Solace, making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...'""
""'Hey, I\'m sorry but I\'ve watched all James Bond movies since the inception of the character first on screen in 1962 in Dr. No. I have seen all the people who played Bond. Almost all of the time it was either Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. They all were suave, cool guys who might have been tough underneath but were classy and right at home in a tuxedo, and had a great sense of humor.This new guy, Daniel Craig, looks like a thug and acts like one. He\'s about as classy as your average rugby player. Give me a break!Even more alarming, the stuff that made the James Bond movies different than the rest of the spy-action movies over the years were (1) the aforementioned classy hero; (2) a lot of fun gadgets, explained by Q; (3) the humor, including all the corny sexual innuendos; (4) a classy boss in \'M\'; here we have Judi Dench as an irritable, foul-mouthed old bag; and (5) the opening credits with the silhouetted naked women. None of that is in here. In other words, this is just another wild, action film with good guys and bad guys. This isn\'t the Bond we have all known for over four decades. Well, I guess all good things come to an end, as they say.'""
""'Since my actual birthday was near, my friend offered to pay for both my admission and concessions when seeing this movie. We both enjoyed Casino Royale, my friend saying it was one of the best. I heartily agree since it was based on the first James Bond novel and as such it stays true to Ian Fleming\'s version of 007. Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there\'s still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch\'s M (God, I miss the Cold War) and Eva Green\'s Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour). And there are the great action set-pieces we\'ve come to love in Bond movies involving construction sites and airports. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. So, yes, I highly recommend Casino Royale.'""

""Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now.""
""'Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I think this is one of the best James Bond films ever made. I wasn\'t a fan of Daniel Craig\'s Bond before this.....but I am now. He was outstanding, as was the whole cast. So was the photography (Roger Deakins - one of the best cinematographers in the business) and the action scenes were extremely entertaining. Sure, some - like the opening - were over-the-top but that\'s what we\'ve all come to expect and enjoy with the Bond movies. This opening scene ranks among the most astounding.Javier Bardem (No Country For Old Men) makes a fascinating villain, even though he doesn\'t appear for the first hour of the film.I\'ve watched the movie three times in just over a year - which is unusual for me - and enjoyed it each time.'""
""Word of mouth is not much in favor of this being one of the best Bond pictures. I rather enjoyed the lesser spotlight on gadgets and parade of vixens. Of course I thought the first minute of the movie might be a car ad. The obligatory car chase opens this 007 assignment and it is interesting enough. James Bond(Daniel Graig)is asked to put his emotions on hold; but still manages to pursue the identity of the man responsible for his loved one's betrayal and death as well as foil a sinister business man's control of a nation's major asset...not oil, but water resource.The story more than a bit messy, but enough action to keep most everyone happy. Agent 007 gets knocked around, cut and bruised...but as usual his endurance training serves him well. M(Judi Dench)casts doubt on her prized agent that stays on mission in spite of declassification traipsing to Italy, Austria and South America.Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton serve as Bond eye candy and Mathieu Amalric is the cocky and ruthless villain that you want a piece of if Bond leaves any. Also in the cast: Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen, Joaquin Cosio and Giancarlo Giannini. Fans wait long enough to get their next Bond fix and have a right to be let down...if that's the case, life goes on. However the theme song for QUANTUM OF SOLACE has to rank among the worst ever.""
""Estella (Emma Stone) was born with usual black and white hair. Her mother keeps warning her against turning to the evil side known as Cruella. The rebellious young girl lost her mother in a Dalmatian attack. She finds a fashion mentor in The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who turns into her rival and then her oppressor.Disney reworking their villains come with some issues. The obvious one for this character is dogs. It does come up with an interesting solution. Now I don't remember Cruella having dogs herself and that threw me off. Killing off her mother with Dalmatians seems to be overkill. At that point, I was going to murder this movie if it made the Dalmatians into villains and excuses. Quite frankly, non of that is necessary as the solution is very simple and very effective. I would have liked The Baroness to pitch the idea of 101 Dalmatians to Walt Disney but that may be going too far.In the end, this is a very good reworking but it is a lot of road to cover. I was so intrigued with little Estella that she would have been plenty enough for a whole movie herself. It would be an interesting battle between Estella and Cruella. It could have been a Carrie revenge story against her school tormentors. A young Cruella movie may have been a better option.""
""To be honest I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie. For some reason I thought it would be a kid movie but the truth is that Cruella is for all ages and very entertaining. The two Emma's (Stone and Thompson) are the major reason for that. They're both skilled actresses and they did a very good job playing their characters. The cinematography is of high quality which was also a thing that made this movie stand out from the rest. And even though the main characters are not very likable persons the story is entertaining from beginning till the end. The dog characters added something cute to the story. Hats off for this movie, much better than I thought it would be.""

I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won\'t forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to movie for me. I really liked it, but it wasn\'t like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, Promising Young Woman is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise.

Something happened in her past, something that radically changed her life.An interesting and thought-provoking revenge-drama. Ultimately it doesn\'t really go anywhere new, directionally, in terms of the revenge-drama genre but is quite entertaining and the plot does take a few unexpected twists and turns. In addition, there is a fair amount of intrigue as to what happened in Cassie\'s past to cause her to be like this.Writer-director Emerald Fennell tries to make the plot as balanced as possible as it could easily have degenerated into a polarising all men are bad scenario. However, this exposes some of the flaws in Cassie\'s thinking and actions, leaving you less than 100% engaged with her: while mostly on her side, on occasion she does seem more a villain than a hero. On the plus side, this adds to the edginess and unpredictably of the plot.'""
""My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered.""

""Greetings from Lithuania.While with 9 th film in the series they threw all physics and realism out of the window, i would lie if i would say if it wasn't entertaining flick for a boring evening. It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see.""

365 Days - B- (Fair)A movie based on series of erotic book trilogy stays true to its source material and gives what is required of it. I have to give to actors; they were truly committed to it. They made the movie enjoyable even with its blatant mindless Stockholm syndrome plot. It gives 100% more satisfaction than the 50 Shades trilogy.Anna Maria Sieklucka is stunning; she reminded me a lot of Turkish renowned female actress Beren Saat from Ask-i Memnu (Forbidden Love). It's a good time-pass for people looking for some Netflix and more Chill!!!
""'If you see the very first one or remember it very well, right from the start you will see the connection. Yes the credits indicate we get the true(?) sequel to the original Halloween. And there are so many nice little treats spread throughout the movie (an actress from the first movie reappearing in a different role, but also shots that are almost the same as in the original ... but sometimes there is a twist for the viewers).The original two main actors reprising their roles too (even if some may argue you can\'t tell with Myers because of his mask). This really is a service to fans and a movie that cherishes the original. Of course since the myriads of sequels introduced a lot of stuff, most of which is thrown out the window (no pun intended). One of the primary things being that like in the original, the Killer and the chosen victim are not related. Even so they have a special bond/relationship. So the only movie you need to watch before this, is the Original movie from 1978 - it will be worth your time. The ending of this new one may feel for some like a let down, but it is what it is and even if it feels like a letdown, it still sort of works in the whole picture'""

The obvious one is the Manson family\'s deeds, but there was also Judy Garland\'s death (and the subsequent Stonewall uprising), the moon landing, and Woodstock. And just as the world was about to move into autumn, Moammar Qaddafi seized power in Libya. What a world it must\'ve been (for the record, I was born long after the \'60s).

""'A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He\'s an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients Lily (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you\'d expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It\'s derivative, certainly - it has shades of The Mummy (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of Dead Man\'s Chest (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd.'""

However Lily finds that Frank is a man who is hard to trust and he is full of cheesy jokes.This comedy adventure is a mish mash of previous movies. I found it more Romancing the Stone mixed with the Brendan Fraser The Mummy movies. There is also a hint of the Pirate of the Caribbean franchise.It harks back to two decades earlier when Disney were adapting their theme park rides rather than superhero movies or remaking their old cartoons as live action films.Jungle Cruise is a colourful romp that lacks originality.'""
""I always make it a rule to only ever do a review once a show or film is ended. In this case, I started about forty minutes in, for one reason only, I was bored to tears.I love the original film, and although a film I thought never needed a follow up, but I was open to it, and thought the basic storyline in this film was pretty good, and imaginative.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, genuinely, the effects, sets and all aspects of the visuals are seriously impressive, that's the major strength, the acting is hard to fault, Gosling is always on point.The downer...... It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears. It never really does though, it improves, but it seems to be on half speed for large spells.I struggled with the plot a bit, possibly because there isn't one.In summary, the window dressing is terrific, it looks sensational, incredibly well acted, the problem, it bored me to tears. 5/10.""

It\'s quite amazing that three hours went by and it did not even feel like three hours. The story is engaging and fuelled with adrenaline. I am very impressed by how well Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character manage to motivate his staff to become successful Wall Street elites.

""Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved.

I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable.

""Though both don't give here an usual performance, if you compare with what they did before. Nothing at all. This looks more like a Walter Hill's film than a Ritchie's one. In the style, it is far far closer to EXTREME PREJUDICE than to SNATCH, in terms of narrative grammar. Definitely. At first, I was sooo scared when they talked about a remake of Nicolas Boukrief's LE CONVOYEUR, so scared...Of course it is different, but maybe even better, and I would have never bet a dime on it. So, what a surprise, in this topic, very unusual, where you deal with several groups, several points of views, where Statham, for once since CRAZY JOE, doesn't play Statham, where you have no good vs evil men, everyone is more or less rotten, and no romance either. Yes, it is a damn good remake, I am nearly ashamed to have been angry about this remake before seeing it; but LE CONVOYEUR is an iconic movie for me. The military robbers group is very well shown, with their families, birthday party, with wives and kids, so we feel empathy for themn though they are the Statham's enemies. That's precisely what I love. Yes, yes yes, tha's the first Guy Ritchie film that I love, and unfortunately maybe the last. A terrific crime flick. A lost gem from Australia and made in 1979, MONEY MOVERS, offers also a very close topic, with also a bloody climax taking place in a security complex facility.""
""It's high school senior year for Bianca (Mae Whitman), and her best friends hot sweet Jess (Skyler Samuels) and hot Latina Casey (Bianca A. Santos). Wesley (Robbie Amell) is her childhood friend, neighbor and man-whore jock. At a party, he tells her that she's Jess and Casey's DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). This throws her into a tailspin. Madison (Bella Thorne) is the class mean girl. Bianca has a crush on Toby but she has trouble talking to him.This conventional teen comedy has a couple of things going for it. Whitman is adorable and believable at being overlooked. Amell plays the jock without being mean-spirited. The 'kids' are mostly in their 20s. With likable Whitman and Amell, the movie is able to maneuver the standard plot without crashing. That's not to say there aren't a couple of awkward moments. Bianca's fantasy scenes do get repetitive and one of them last too long. It's a gimmick that loses its effectiveness. The movie doesn't work all the time but it works enough. It's not quite 'Mean Girls'. The writing isn't as sharp. It probably needs a great comedic writer to add more of the better material.""

""Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.Using his confined locationÃ¢ÂÂa packed intercity trainÃ¢ÂÂto maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.""

""'I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan Biggest screen in the UK), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called The Joker, but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And The Dark Knight is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!'""
""'After Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City, Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.'""
""'Unbelievably enough, then it is only now in 2013 that I got around to actually watching The Dark Knight. Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with The Dark Knight, then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in The Dark Knight is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then The Dark Knight really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, The Dark Knight offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.The Dark Knight was a major step upwards from Batman Begins, and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch The Dark Knight Rises as well.'""

And Millicent Simmonds is even more outstanding as the clever daughter.

He wants them out.This is a good sequel and builds upon the first movie. It's filling in both sides of the story and the franchise could continue with more production. The girl continues to be a standout among some great veteran adult actors. I would double-down more with the silence concept. I would strip the foley work to a bare minimum and some of the movie background music. Let the silence haunt this movie. Let's go all natural. That would be my biggest change. The other change is when they find the new sanctuary. They need to locate the target right away. They wouldn't take too long of a break. I would have them wake up from exhaustion and rush around trying to find the target. They could stumble upon the boat while on the search and the movie would end the same way. All in all, this is a very solid sequel to a compelling and unique franchise. I would just steer into the uniqueness of the franchise and go even more quiet.""

This puts the world in jeopardy.I'm not a fan of super-hero / comic book movies but didn't mind the first Wonder Woman movie so much. It wasn't brilliant but did have more of a plot than most films in the genre and initially limited the fantasy / sci fi nonsense. The film did revert to type towards the end, with a lame plot and superficial CGI-driven action scenes but for the most part it was entertaining.Wonder Woman 1984 follows roughly the same path: decent plot and set-up in the beginning but then unravels and becomes quite superficial and clichÃÂ©d towards the end. Gal Gadot's performance in the first film wasn't a problem but here it does set the film back slightly. Maybe there's more dialogue in this one, that's why.Overall: not great, not terrible, entertaining enough.""

The opening of Diana as a child was great, but didn't tie into the overall film that well, and yes it is supposed to. The script was generic fluff and I still don't know what she did during WWII. Nice end cameo by Linda Carter. Does that means she is going to be in future films? The end speech by Diana was such a bore, I was wishing for the world to end.""

It is quite impossible to recognize Elizabeth Banks travestied in her androgynous character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Jogos Vorazes (Voracious Games)'""
""'I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book The Hunger Games or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!'""
""Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10""

'Ari Aster considers his Hereditary more of a family drama than a horror movie. I can see that. It does focus more on grief than on jump scares. It\'s no comparison to The Shining in creating terror (but what movie is?).There were certainly a few scenes that shocked me. The downsides are the uneven performances and a few things that look kind of silly. But that dollhouse and a couple of tricks that rival Hitchcock in using non-verbal ways to tell the story make for one fine movie. I hope that Aster makes more movies like this.'
""I am glad to see that this was actually a Hollywood re-make that improved on something already established, as re-makes tend to be tedious and unnecessary money machines.However, this 2017 remake really upped the game a lot in terms of horror, violence, blood and pure weirdness. They definitely went for a more evil and sinister feel to the movie, and Pennywise shed his family-friendly skin (that he wore in the 1990's version) and draped a cape voven of pure dread.The storyline is much familiar, if you have seen the 1990 edition, but there is so much more added to this 2017 version. It does the novel much more justice.The CGI and special effects are good, and do add a lot of spice to the movie.Pennywise was adequate, although it was a bit difficult taking him serious with those buck teeth and the way he kept pouncing towards the children. The scene where Pennywise was dancing below in the caves was also a bit too comical for my liking.The children were really doing amazing jobs with their characters and roles in this 2017 version.It was definitely worth the wait and the hype. And for once, a Hollywood re-make that didn't turn out to be a questionable re-make spawned only by utter greed, pointlessness and a lack of creative thought.""

""'It\'s been quite a while since I felt the Oscar winner for best actor actually turned in the best effort... Well, there is absolutely no doubt here that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on fine form as the elderly gent who is struggling to keep a grip on reality as he suffers from dementia. Coupled with a sparing contribution from Dame Olivia Colman who plays his daughter Anne and who is also excellent as the woman trying to juggle her own life with the responsibilities of caring for her father - sometimes lucid, sometimes less so... The performance from Hopkins allows him to build on his substantial stage experience to present us with a deeply thought out portrayal of a man dealing with psychological issues he (and sometimes the audience, too) is largely unaware he has, and he excels. Regrettably, the supporting cast let the film down rather - Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell could have done so much more as actors and with their characters - though, to be fair, their appearances seem to serve as little more than a bit of light relief for the audience from the intensity of Sir Anthony\'s contribution. The extent to which Florian Zeller has referred to any established clinical templates or practices when directing his own play for the big screen doesn\'t matter - this reeks of authenticity and engenders frustration, empathy and sympathy like no film that I have seen for many a year.

Well, there is absolutely no doubt here that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on fine form as the elderly gent who is struggling to keep a grip on reality as he suffers from dementia. Coupled with a sparing contribution from Dame Olivia Colman who plays his daughter Anne and who is also excellent as the woman trying to juggle her own life with the responsibilities of caring for her father - sometimes lucid, sometimes less so... The performance from Hopkins allows him to build on his substantial stage experience to present us with a deeply thought out portrayal of a man dealing with psychological issues he (and sometimes the audience, too) is largely unaware he has, and he excels. Regrettably, the supporting cast let the film down rather - Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell could have done so much more as actors and with their characters - though, to be fair, their appearances seem to serve as little more than a bit of light relief for the audience from the intensity of Sir Anthony\'s contribution. The extent to which Florian Zeller has referred to any established clinical templates or practices when directing his own play for the big screen doesn\'t matter - this reeks of authenticity and engenders frustration, empathy and sympathy like no film that I have seen for many a year. A must watch, I\'d say...'""
""I am going to start with the strengths of this Bond entry. It is for me one of the better-looking Bonds, both the cinematography and locations are truly inspired, and I loved the Icelandic snow palace. The pacing is relentless and the direction is done with fluid style, while the incidental music is good enough. The script has some nice moments too apart from some cringe-worthy one liners, while the action is very intense. In terms of acting, Pierce Brosnan is on fine form as the betrayed and vengeful secret agent. Bond is still charming and witty in some ways, but also tough and angry, Brosnan portrays this excellently. Halle Berry is a nice addition, and Judi Dench and John Cleese are solid too as is Toby Stephens as villainous Graves and especially beautiful Rosamund Pike as chillingly frosty Miranda Frost. However, the plot is quite familiar and quite preposterous in a sense in the second half, and there is an overload of CGI and sadly it's awful. My two main problems though are both to do with Madonna. One is that her theme song is truly grating and one of the more forgettable theme songs. The other is that her cameo as a fencing instructor is truly dire. In conclusion, a mostly solid if slightly disappointing entry in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox""
""This is Pierce Brosnan's fourth stint as James Bond and probably the best Bond flick in long time. This loud, action-packed adventure has 007 taking on an enigmatic agent (Halle Berry)to help take on a madman with a satellite-laser weapon. An ego troubled diamond broker; a power hungered North Korean terrorist; an ice fortress and a world as we know it to protect...gorgeous girls, fascinating gadgets and beautiful locations equal a top shelf Bond movie. Also in the cast are: Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Michael Madsen and a cameo by Madonna who also sings the theme song. Maybe a little long, but this is fun and James Bond.""
""'This Stephen King film adaptation will please as many fans as it confuses.

His own peace of mind is re-shattered when he meets a teenage girl, Abra (Kyliegh Curran). who has he own extrasensory gift, that is known as the \'shine. She has sought out Dan for protection from a cult called The True Knot that seeks her out to \'feed\' off of her \'shine\'. Good versus evil and a quest for immortality.Violent, graphic and disturbing visions of death. Also featured in the cast: Rebecca Ferguson, Emily Alyn Lind, Cliff Curtis, Carel Struycken and Zahn McLarnon.'""
""'I watched this twice, 3 weeks apart, at home on DVD from my public library. Unfortunately there are no extras regarding making of the movie.Ewan McGregor is the grown up little Dan Torrance from The Shining. He has had a difficult life including turning to alcohol in struggling with his innate ability to shine. Unlike the first movie, which was almost entirely in the lodge in the winter, this one is set at various locations across the USA, but getting back to the lodge near the end is necessary to wrap up the story.Although this is not my favorite genre, and I\'m not a big fan of The Shining, I really like this movie. It has lots of complexity and interesting characters. Even though it runs a bit over 2 hours it never seemed long.Good movie and Rebecca Ferguson is also very good as Rose The Hat who with her band of shiners capture children who shine and absorb their steam so that they may live almost forever. But Dan and Abra have something to say about that.'""

""'Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg, The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston. Nicholson is at his most charismatic over-the-top as mob boss Frank Costello, Damon is fine as Costello\'s informant at police headquarters, DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down. Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon\'s father is on the phone. Also compelling is newcomer Vera Farmiga as Damon\'s girlfriend and DiCaprio\'s shrink and lover. Watch also for Anthony Anderson and from 24, James Badge Dale. Well worth seeing for Scorsese enthusiasts.'""
""Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm.""
""'Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in The Departed, he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem.The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction.The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor.The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops.The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.'""
""'I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie.Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a normal person.This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. Tobey Maguire plays a likable Peter Potter (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. It was kind of interesting to see \'60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter\'s Uncle Ben. This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place.'""

A year later they get notes telling them that someone knows what they did last summer. This is all a copy of the first I Know What You Did Last Summer and throws in some very funny parodies of sequences from the movie pointing out all the stupidity and inconsistent plot lines. However there\'s also a killer wandering around dressed just like the killer from the Scream movies and we get parodies from those movies too.The jokes are sometimes VERY crude and not all of them work but, as a horror fan, I found this movie hilarious. I got every reference and plot point they were making fun of it and the movie keeps moving full tilt throwing out jokes left and right. The plot doesn\'t make a lot of sense but neither did the original movies. The cast are as good as they can be saying their lines with completely straight faces and enjoying themselves.

""Mortal Kombat has been rebooted as a gore laden and a more serious action packed movie.It is surprisingly entertaining but a predictable film. The director makes effective use of some visceral battle fights.It starts off in 17th Century Japan. Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) kills the ninja clan led by Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. He kills Hanzo as well as his wife and son.Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's infant daughter to safety.In the present day. Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten tournaments known as Mortal Kombat. If Earthrealm loses the tenth tournament, it can be conquered by Outworld.An ancient prophecy that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will bring a new generation of Earthrealm's champions. One such person is a former MMA fighter named Cole Young (Lewis Tan.)The movie needed a bit more humour. I thought Kano (Josh Lawson) who provided some of the banter quickly became tiring.The big problem was the lack of a well known star so this really is a B movie fodder.

""'Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien\'s Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I\'m not going to summarize the story--there\'s way to much going on.  All I\'ll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that\'s to get in the plot) and there\'s a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I\'ve ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there\'s so much plot and action going on that you\'re exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it\'s the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!'""

""This is actually one of the best teen movies in the past few decades that I can think of.First of all, the screenplay is great. Tina Fey did a great job, she is definitely a great comedian. Besides her we also have many other actors from SNL so it is not surprising that it is so good.The storyline is pretty clever. Of course since it is not documentary but comedy it does exaggerate what high school is like but one still can connect to the issues it presents. And it is full of quotes that are just classic now.The characters are all well done to represent different kind of students and parents. And the main characters have a deeper personality, one starts to understand them and their actions the more one gets to know them.Acting is very good as well. Everyone did a great job. I especially want to mention Rachel McAdams who was Regina, the meanest girl o them all. And she was perfect in this role.There isn't anything bad about this movie that I can think of.

""'Tina Fey of \'Saturday Night Live\' fame writes the screenplay for this very entertaining teen comedy.

She finds herself being asked to infiltrate the group in order to sabotage the most feared girls in the school. She makes a critical mistake of falling for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend(Jonathan Bennett). A \'Burn Book\' containing vicious rumors and harmful truths written by The Plastics causes chaos throughout the girl world of this upper middle class high school. Its girl against girl and friend against friend. Who can they trust?

Others in this quirky comedy are: Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried and Amy Poehler. MEAN GIRLS is a fun movie to watch...I guess because girls will be girls. If you haven\'t fallen in love with Lindsay Lohan yet...you will soon.'""
""'I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because gay Richard from Big Brother 7 was talking about it all the time in the house, and called many of the girls Plastics (he was a good housemate). Anyway, basically Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student from Africa, and quite quickly becomes friends with possible-lesbian Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). But soon enough they want her to get to know the crudest, most beautiful and most popular girls in the school, The Plastics, unofficial leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), follower Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). As she gets to know them to tell Janis and Damian their dark secrets, she finds out they have a hate book with every person that has done something they hate them for. Also, Cady falls for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) along the way. There is a lot of back-stabbing and argumentative moments, and I can see why Richard used Plastics as his descriptions, but this isn\'t really one of those great teen or chick flick films, but young girls will probably love it. I guess they are called Plastics because they are pretty much like Barbie dolls, beautiful (almost), naive and compete thickos. Worth watching, at least once!'""

This is understandable but is a pity, as it overshadows the deep emotional exchanges and the psychological fluctuations of the characters concerned.

He\'s a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn\'t mean taste can\'t vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as Halloween (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with Wait Until Dark is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like Wait Until Dark being a radio drama.For Hush, we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a Buffy reference or what?'""

The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in Thirteen Ghosts are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in Thirteen Ghosts. Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F.

It is an eye for an eye Story that delivers a fiery Yarn that is a surreal study of Good vs Evil with heavy doses of Religion and Philosophy.It is a finely Acted Movie with Denzel, Dakota, and all, adding to this already engaging roller coaster ride. It is a severely saturated Sangre, especially in the second half. There are Industrial Music Samples counterpointed by the sweet vanilla sounds like Linda Ronstadt and the Soundtrack is just one of the many exciting things that the always playful Director uses to Entertain.This is an Action Fans Film with a Heart and the palpitations never end making this a unique, uncomfortable, yet satisfying Movie that never ceases to display itself as an Artistic Vision of a Real-Life tragedy.""

It's perfectly safe for him to go home. There is a way to raise the stakes by taking away a safe return as an emergency exit. If the two boys are refugees and their ocean home destroyed, it would raise the danger and their ultimate stakes. If they have to leave the ocean, it would be a more compelling dangerous journey.

Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall).

"[""'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10.""]",Negative

Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.\n2.

I like the idea of this concept but the concept actually imbeds a devious story landmine. It forces a lot of the action into flashbacks. The narrative becomes a labyrinthian mess. It strives for something interesting but fails to grasp it. Writer/director Lisa Joy seems to be trying to branch out on her own after her work on Westworld.

"['Ok, so I\'m not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le CarrÃ©-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it\'s the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke\'s film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in ""Penkovsky"" (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn\'t up to holding together.

John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don\'t really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn\'t scary in the slightest.

"[""This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere.

It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day.

And it really hurts that it\'s 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn\'t give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that\'s so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an ""Action Movie"" despite having Gerard Butler\'s name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you\'re probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER.']",Negative

"[""It's been a while since I've seen a good comet disaster movie, so I was looking forward to 'Greenland'.Fortunately, 'Greenland' did not disappoint. The film is not as action-packed as 'Armageddon', since it focused more on the drama surrounding the disaster. The film also illustrated people's behavior during disaster, and the dire consequences of their actions, and humanity's inability to work together when disaster strikes.Within the first few minutes the film hit us with an overdone cliche: a disaster movie featuring yet another couple with marital problems who will - no doubt - be reunited due to the disaster. Fortunately, the rest of the film was not as cliched and a great depiction of human greed and selfishness.The suspense is elevated by our hero, John's son Nathan, who is diabetic. John and his wife, Allison, and son has been selected to be taken to an underground shelter. However, just before boarding the plane, Nathan forgets his insulin in the car. This sets off a series of events that throws their lives - and chances of survival - into turmoil. Thanks to good performances, this film felt realistic, and there's some excellent scenes of comet debris crashing to earth. 'Greenland' is an easy watch with a simple premise and no surprise twists.And who is to say this can't - or won't - happen?Would I watch it again? Possibly.""]",Negative

Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is.""]",Negative

Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment.

It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn\'t help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, ""Let Him Go"" is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that\'s about it.

He tries his best but he cones of so bland. He seriously effects the film and the chemistry with Lana Condor.

That being the film is sweet enough despite being riddled with more cliches than your typical teen film. The ending however is a let down.That being said it is an enjoyable film which does have a lot of charm and heart but it just doesn't stand out that much.

"['This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele\'s song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Skyfall"" is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century!

Of course there isn\'t much of a plot here ... it\'s a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that.

"[""'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure.

It has a far more adult edge than the miniseries, and it's much, much darker.

The scares are well telegraphed and perhaps a little too inevitably reliant on CGI trickery, but for a modern horror they're quite effective. I didn't mind the updating to the 1980s setting either as it makes sense to follow King's trend of setting the past scenes 27 years before the present day.

Because while this kind of feels like a slasher movie ... it isn't. And you can tell early on, that there is more.

You have to, no doubt about it.Another thing that there is no doubt about: you can't be squeamish!

"[""I despise David Lynch's Dune. In my not so very humble opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen. It is utterly nonsensical and impossible to follow, the actors are almost all miscast (except for Sting, Dean Stockwell, and Patrick Stewart, who all mainly work as novelty), and the visuals are hideous. I also tried reading the novel once, but got bored after the first chapter.So when a friend asked me whether I wanted to watch the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries of Dune, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the whole thing. By the end of the first episode of three I was impressed at the technical side of the film. Vittorio Storaro, the same cinematographer who photographed Apocalypse Now and Reds, did an amazing job on this film, even if the visuals do go overboard sometimes. The gimmicks that the filmmakers employed most often worked well, especially the bizarre primary color lighting schemes. By the second episode, I felt I new the plot. By the end of the series, I felt that I knew the characters. While the narrative is still choppy and sometimes hard to follow (the biggest problem is that there are far too many characters in it), it ultimately works well. I felt that I had finally seen what Dune fanatics were raving about. This series is great. See it and forget that David Lynch ever dirtied his hands with his version.""]",Negative

I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever.

The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.""]",Negative

I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit.

An unusually subdued Denzel Washington is the slightly grizzled older cop, (been there, done that), Rami Malek is the young detective desperate to shake off any resemblance to Freddie Mercury and Jared Leto is the probable killer. It\'s a slow, handsome-looking film, so determined not to be sensational that it veers towards the dull side. The writer and director is John Lee Hancock so I guess the blame lies largely with him.Denzel\'s character, the great detective whose intuation is almost superhuman, is a cliche too far; he\'s now the right age to channel his inner Morgan Freeman while Malek is just sleep-walking through his role. Leto, however, is outstanding, giving the movie a much needed kick as well as a touch of class, acting his co-stars off the screen though that fine and underrated actor Terry Kinney gives a lift to his few scenes as Malek\'s boss.

Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie.

"['Without a doubt, Frances McDormand has been one of the greatest US actresses of the past three decades. Humble and unglamorous, she\'s the opposite of the stereotypical movie star, making her Oscar wins all that more important. So it\'s no surprise that she now stars in ChloÃ© Zhao\'s ""Nomadland"", as a laid-off woman traversing the western US. McDormand put so much effort into the role that many of her co-stars - many of whom aren\'t professional actors - didn\'t know that they were working with a professional actress.I\'ve heard of ChloÃ© Zhao for a few years, but this is the first movie of hers that I\'ve seen. I now want to see her other movies. This is simply an excellent movie.

He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody.

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben.

The other problem with Hellsing is that a couple of eps move too slow so much in fact that youll fast forward to the action and then rewind to the dialogue.As for the DVD boxed sets every braggs about they aint really nothing. Brief special features only lasting a couple of minutes is not enough for $30 to 50 set. Youd be better download eps of the net for free.Hellsing is good anime just not great.

"['""Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance"" is a 2006 mini-series consisting of 10 episodes (5 minutes max, usually shorter) that was made to create a bridge between two seasons of the original series. It runs for roughly the length of a usual episode and features some of the main characters of the show. Thumbs up for that as it\'s not a given. Some shows (""Walking Dead"", I think) include random mini-series that do not feature any of the main players. The action includes the rise of new life, the death of old life and some moral questions about the connection between arms and holy places. Director Wayne Rose was assistant director on the original series and made a whole bunch of webisodes, also between other seasons. Writer Ronald D. Moore wrote a lot of these too, but also, even better, also some episodes of ""Battlestar Galactica"".My favorite episode is the one where they are mourning for the blonde woman that died. All in all, however, I was not wowed enough so that I would feel a need to watch ""Battlestar Galactica"" anytime soon, maybe also because it is not really my genre. It\'s a good watch for huge fans of the show, but not a must-see by any means.']",Negative

""'Producers will blame the poor box office of No Time to Die on COVID but that\'s not why it\'s bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn\'t made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn\'t that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn\'t a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn\'t have even noticed the jokes. It\'s also about twenty minutes too long. No Time to Die bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig\'s not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.'""

""Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.If you are able to leave those thoughts to the side and not be clouded by them, you may be able to enjoy this more. The story is quite straightforward - you have the evil Emma and the good Emma - which will become Evil. Sorry I can't just put this to the side. Obvious name choices to the side (and convenient happenings/accidents too), the actors do a fantastic job. The movie is quite dark for a family entertainment entry, but so was the 101 Dalmatians ... to a point.If you love those involved, you will get more out of it too. If you love dresses, you will have the time of your life - no pun intended.""
""'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10.""
""'Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it\'s not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of show, don\'t tell, by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don\'t mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.'""

""Why do I do it, why do I always think that the number one choice is going to be good, it never is, and there's a good example of it here.Kate has 24 hours to get revenge on those that poisoned her, that's literally the plot, that start is followed by the most improbable, crazy fight sequences you will ever see.It goes on a bit, it looks pretty good, I loved the visuals, but that's the best element, the story is wafer thin, it lacks any sort of heart.Good acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cracking, I am a big fan, sadly Woody isn't around for much, and that's a real shame.All in all, another disappointing film on Netflix, 5/10.""

However, the predictable and full of clichÃÂ©s script seems to have been made by a machine. Music score is horrible.

Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire.

Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point.

No story until the last minute, terrible acting, erotic scenes that made me laugh, weak dialog and in general hands down an awful show.

""This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020.""

I see so many reviews filled with hatred towards an accused and just because of that they have rated it 1, it's not even remotely related to the movie, sorry to see so many dumb Indians.Now to the movie, this is just dull and ridiculous. The characters start shady from the beginning, that just ruins any buildup towards a good thriller. They make it so obvious, that you can easily guess what's gonna happen.Despite a strong cast, actors don't have much to do because of a poor script.Just skip this movie. Waste of time.""
""Calling this film boring would be an understatement. This film is a preachy, lethargic, crude and hollow thriller with neither style nor substance.I kept expecting something good to happen, and it never did. The plot is not good even for a short story, let alone a feature-length movie. The central mystery is really dull and it's presented in the most tedious way possible. Characters are uninteresting and the acting is flat. The monologue by Amit Ji is so preachy, stale and stupid that you really start to wonder about who wrote this crap. In my opinion, those self-righteous kooks, calling themselves protectors of law and justice, were equally at fault and should have been blamed for the casualty.This is waste of time and resources. There is no place for logic and reasoning in this film. The cinematography is good but visuals during the end sequences are reprehensible.The makers said during the release of the film that this is the film that is going to revive our theatres. If this is the kind of movie which is going to be made for theatres, let them be defunct.""
""'I tried, I really did! I hoped that the fairly decent, experienced, ensemble cast coupled with state of the art visual effects and a collection of modern-day pop lyrics would breathe new life into this timeless story. Well, sadly, that was all just a triumph for optimism over, well, just about anything... It\'s terrible. Good looking, well produced, but terrible. Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in Mamma Mia (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it\'s nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I\'d not be so harsh - but I\'m not and this is poor, really poor...'""

This film recounts how arson has replaced baseball as Motown\'s main municipal pastime, given that most of the DFD personnel have quit in recent years due to the chronic lack of bath tissue at their stations. Detroit\'s police chiefs always are more interested in making personal gubernatorial runs than in solving homicides, so this blighted region perennially vies with Mexico for having the distinction of the lowest conviction rate for murderers in the known world.

This movie is directed by Rodo Sayagues in his directorial debut and stars Stephen Lang (Avatar), Madelyn Grace (Grey's Anatomy), Brendan Sexton III (Boys Don't Cry), Rocci Williams (Wrath of Man) and Adam Young (Sex Education). The storyline and settings for this are way better than they should be. There's a subtle post apocalyptic feel to it with excellent violence and gore that reminded me of a slightly toned down Hobo with a Shotgun. The premise, once it's revealed, is crazy and over the top goodness. The movie starts with two fantastic kill scenes and hits the ground running. The final couple kills are cinematic gold. Loved the special effects and use of various props for their kill scenes. This is a horror fans dream movie that is an absolute must see. I'd score this an easy 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.""
""'This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new war is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes.It did not find this one as interesting and entertaining. So to distil it down, what is it about?There is an old John Denver song Poems, Prayers and Promises and part of the lyrics go like this:Talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in\nHow sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care\nHow long it\'s been since yesterday and what about tomorrow?What about our dreams and all the memories we share?And in a great sense that is what the movie is ultimately saying, find things to believe in rather than accentuate our differences. I found much of it interesting and entertaining, while I found some of it to be dull and uninteresting. It definitely isn\'t a 1 or a 2 but it also isn\'t better than about a 6 or a 7 when compared to other fantasy movies.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.'""
""I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 2/5\nComedy 0/5""
""'This movie has some really bad points. It isn\'t the worst action hero movie ever. It\'s 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.\nFirstly the bad points:\n1. The story. This silly wish premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn\'t have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It\'s beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.\n2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.\nThe good points:\n1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.\n2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.\n3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.\n4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.\nThe cast is good but they can\'t save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.\n5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.'""

The action is not quite as cool although there is plenty of it. I do not like the Home Alone booby-traps in the last part. Overall, it's an interesting attempt. I like it enough.

""If you get the idea for your movie from somewhere else and then you do a great film, you are an artist. What are you after you get the idea for your movie from at least three different beloved stories and still do a ridiculously bad film?That's the story of this piece of garbage which manages to mix around the ideas of Alien Earth War, The Thing and something like The Forever War or Old Man's War, gets Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons in the cast and then takes all of that goodness and somehow manages to drive it into the ground via a latrine. The incompetence of the writer's staff for this film is astounding. Nothing makes sense in this film, I mean literally nothing.Bottom line: ignore this completely. The only worse film this year is Army of the Dead.""
""...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.It's an interesting film, it's almost like a sci fi film noir, it has that moody, subdued atmosphere, and the appropriate dialogue, the contradiction comes with the water logged Cities and imaginative technology, an interesting contrast of styles.The trailers looked great, the film looks fantastic, but for me there was too much of a focus on the visuals, and not enough on the actual storytelling, which at times was a little drab. Visually though it's amazing, the futuristic world looks awesome, throw in Rebecca Ferguson's gorgeous presence and Jackman's muscles, and you have something for everyone.Imaginative, interesting, just a little too slow for me, it felt like a film hampered by restrictions, which of course it was. 6/10.""
""In the near-future, Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) lives in a flooded Miami due to climate change. He and his assistant Emily 'Watts' Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) operate a machine for people to relive their best memories. Both are veterans of a devastating recent war. Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in asking for help to find her keys and begins a relationship with Nick. She goes missing and Nick becomes haunted reliving his memories with her over and over again. The police hires him to get into a comatose suspect's memories where he discovers Mae working as a nightclub waitress. He starts investigating on his own and dives into a rabbit hole of mysteries.There is a lot to like in this near-future sci-fi noir. I like the style of it. I like Hugh Jackman. I like the idea of this concept but the concept actually imbeds a devious story landmine. It forces a lot of the action into flashbacks. The narrative becomes a labyrinthian mess. It strives for something interesting but fails to grasp it. Writer/director Lisa Joy seems to be trying to branch out on her own after her work on Westworld. She has something there but it needs work. The first thing I would work on is the title. It's trying to be Nolanesque without the self-confidence.""
""I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view.""

""The Courier is based on true events, the Cuban Missile Crisis to be more precise. It's an entertaining movie but don't expect too much action scenes as there are almost none. It's more a spy drama about an event that the whole world knows about. The cast did a good job playing their characters. I've never been a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I have to admit he can act. He just has one of those faces I don't really like but credits to him, he can act. The Courier is certainly worth a watch, especially if you like historical facts and spy movies about the Cold War.""
""I feel the story was too slow without enough substance to fill up the 112 min runtime. The premise of the story just wasn't interesting enough to be that long, and it should've been sped up and trimmed down to no more than 80 min runtime. Casting and performances were great, and probably the main reason I didn't fall asleep. Considering it was put together by fairly newb filmmakers, I'm still giving it a generous 7/10.""
""'Ok, so I\'m not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le CarrÃÂ©-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it\'s the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke\'s film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn\'t up to holding together. It doesn\'t need a big screen, and will make for an adequate late night thriller on the telly, but unfortunately it offered little more.'""
""'Frankly Grillo is in very good shape. The film has the same repetitive stuff again n again.\nThe plot n ending is terrible.\nAfter a while the film is not able to hold attention cos of the monotonous stuff.\nNaomi Watts is totally wasted n the less said bah Mad Gibson, the better.'""
""'This starts off really quite strongly. The Warren\'s - Ed (Patrick Wilson) and wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are brought in to conduct an exorcism upon a young boy but somewhere during the process, the spirit manages to swap bodies and the life of the boy\'s older friend Arne (Ruairi O\'Connor) starts to take on an unpredictable nature that culminates in him being charged for the murder of his friend - which we know he did. Was he possessed at the time of the crime? Well the Warren\'s decide that they are going to try and offer this as a form of defence and so they set about tracking down his demon and proving their point. It\'s from here on in that the thing falls away quite badly. John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don\'t really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn\'t scary in the slightest. Perhaps we are all becoming just too numb to the impact of visual effects to create menace? It is certainly becoming more difficult for a director to get those jump moments, especially with format horror like this. Sadly, truth isn\'t stranger than fiction any more and if the Conjuring is to continue, it will need quite a creative overhaul. This is worth a watch, but is pretty unremarkable.'""
'3 out of 5 stars.The third film does offer some thrills and scares. But the direction is a little less grounded this time. Getting away from the haunted house concept to following an investigation on a person being accused for murder which he was possessed.Great cast. But little less scares.'

It has word play b*ner jokes as the funniest aspect of the movie, to give you a clue.

""Too many unnecessary scenes and infantile dialogue riddled with foul language you'd never expect to hear from those spewing it. There was way to much time spent on filler and not enough on substance. What was the point of that entire outdoor drinking on picnic tables act? The pick-up truck parachute and arrest scenes? The constant repetitive flashbacks only inching each time just a little more facts on her past incident also became annoying. Just spit it out, and move on with the current drama and all too little excitement. Never mind it was totally boring and pointless for the movies plot-line. Even the idea of the cat and mouse wasn't concluded, nor why it even started or who ordered it. The screenplay felt like it had random scenes cut out and/or was poorly edited. The 100 min runtime felt much longer with all the boring filler. I'm not sure if the book is as bad at the screenplay and direction, but this one had a great conceptual idea that ultimately burns out quickly. Jolie was the worst casting choice, and for the most part was unconvincing in her role and her acting abilities. Her swearing trying to act all tough with her long stringy hair was just getting annoying and unbearable. The little boy was more believable than her. Too bad, the premise was great, was it was poorly executed.""

""This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood.""

In the mythology of this series they are both on our side, kinda, as Titans, avatars of worldwideworthness, but they are also huge rivals.

We also have a number of human factions, all of whom have their own agendas.There is quite a lot of apparent plot here, but much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. However, it is nicely played by a good cast (no Nick Fury, Captain Marvel or Loki, but we do have the lady baddie from Iron Man 3). There is also a great deal of utter, utter nonsense: Florida to Hong Kong by secret high speed underground tube travel in what appears to be 10 minutes, anyone?But, of course, this is all about a pair of 400 foot tall antagonists beating the snot out of each other, and that is there in abundance.

The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that The Forever Purge is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it.'""

Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there\'s a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It\'s a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting.

What we do get is a really tame, poorly executed horror flick in which virtually all of the dozen are dead within the first five minutes and we embark on a truly implausible hunt by the survivors to turn the tables. The two in the gas station inject a little levity into the proceedings but otherwise it is rather a missed opportunity that will not linger long in the mind.'""
""Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll.""
""Gave it a good half hour before turning it off. I like to give films a chance but it didn't keep my interest. I felt like it was a generic action film and whilst action is great in films, script is more important.""
""A problematic film, this one, but not without merit. Localised and shot in and around Pittsburgh so as a Romero fan that was a nice treat. Jason Momoa can do this kind of role in his sleep by now so he's as good as you'd expect. The big pharma back story is very timely, but it never really ties up with the BOURNE style hitmen and bodyguards running around all over the place, it doesn't feel too realistic. The writing is kind of sloppy here. As for the big twist at the climax, I didn't mind it all that much personally but I can see how some might. One strong point is the action choreography which is always on point.""
""'I\'ve never been there but a have a soft spot with any movie that\'s filmed in and around Pittsburgh, PA. I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows?

The likeable cast ends up spinning their wheels in pretty bad material.'""

Even though I personally don't enjoy romantic movies, I had enjoyed the first movie because it is realistic.Now coming to this movie, it was ruined by overacting by almost everyone especially the main leads. As a direct sequel to After, this movie focuses on Tessa's job as an intern and how she deals with the revelation from the first movie. The poor plot and poor execution along with overacting are exactly what ruined the whole movie.Another thing I noticed is that a few characters from the previous movie were played by different actors.

The problem some may have is not that, but the cliches that will become quite apparent throughout the movie. Not to mention the sheer luck (or coincidence?) the main characters seem to have. If you don't mind this and are all for female (em)power(ment) and don't mind the one brush of character our bad guy has (Ewan McGregor is still quite amazing, even with so little to play with, no pun intended) ... you will have fun.

""This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere. Not to mention locking your kids up in the basement when this comes on.""

And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It\'s not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was inspired from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean\'s N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can\'t recommend it yet I can\'t say it was a bad movie.

""'This horror movie is so pc or en woky that the director and writer forgot the horror - this German movie is an excellent example of what\'s wrong with many, if not most, movie productions these days - too many people who have a mission are involved or people who just ride comfortably and without taking any risk on the wave of zeitgeist. Really, I confess, I was on one side annoyed but on the other side fascinated - in past times people wanted to make a horror movie to entertain and maybe add their footprint into the making of the art of horror. Today, people seem to be contend to clean everything with total pc stuff and call it creative and progressive (I call it comedy) but just use an overused plot and make necessary woky changes. Orson Wells would have a lot of fun these days. Anyway, back to the movie - production, effects, gore and acting is below average. Wrong Turn 2021 - a movie nobody really needs (besides a certain kind of people). Watch the movie with the same title from 2003 again (no matter if this movie is related to the franchise or not, if not it is a money grabber too) and your time is far better spend.Last note: in a certain sense the title of the movie is what one could be tempted to call prophetic.'""
""The problem here are the good guys. They come across as purely horrible people. When you first meet them they irritate you, and they do it in the same vapid way people that have a BA in BS think they educated enough to decide what is best for everyone on earth living in situations they have never experienced....... and that attitude carries over to their interaction with the locals, who they insult and belittle in a way that is framed to almost side with the protagonists.So, when the killing starts, they have annoyed you to the point that you want them to lose, and you want to see the backwoods cannibals eat them... just so you don't have to hear them drone on and on in their pedestrian hipster snobbery any longer.So you there is no suspense, no hope that the protagonists make it out a live, because the film took enough time to make certain they irritate you to no end. And that kills the suspense.And then, on the other side, they muted the backwoods hillbilly cannibals too in both appearance and Deliverance style redneckiness, so there is really nothing grotesque or horrible about them, and, instead, so they really aren't frightening, not so deformed, not at all horrific.In fact, the only thing that makes them remotely decent is the fact that they are killing the other characters that annoyed you to the point you wanted to walk away... about 10 minutes into the film.""
Should've had horror when the car has a flat tire is probably the worst thing about it. Other than the car aspect this Wrong Turn is epic more horror than expected but the main characters aren't very likable where as unfortunately I wouldn't mind if they all died. Its a very mediocre adaptation of a masterful horror! So many bad things happen that's not exciting for the genre; one of few occasions where I support the villains. The terror/violence is easily the best aspect by far!

""'This year\'s sure-fire Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature and probably Best Original Score, Soul is a brilliant mess of a movie more likely to appeal to adults than to children who almost certainly won\'t \'get\' it, (and they certainly won\'t get the references to A Matter of Life and Death unless they have sophisticated cineaste parents). In some ways it\'s both old-fashioned and ground-breaking, at least in its attempt to push the boundaries of children\'s animation while never reaching the sublime heights of say The Incredibles or Inside Out. The animation may be extraordinary but we\'ve been here before.The title, of course, has more than one meaning. Soul might refer to what a good jazz musician puts into his music but more fundamentally here it also refers to what we are all said to carry within us. Quite early in the film our hero finds himself on a \'Stairway to Heaven\' to give that Powell and Pressburger film its other title and from here on it alternates between the avant-garde and that old-fashioned Pixar formula right down to a talking cat, (big mistake). A brilliant voice cast, (Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Angela Bassett, Daveed Diggs and a surprisingly cast Graham Norton of all people), do what they can with the material but the scirpt is uninspired and it is noticeably lacking in gags, (I think kids will get bored quite quickly).

Now that you\'ve got my mild warning, I\'d advise you to haul a couple of kids into the room to watch this with you, as it would probably make the experience more enjoyable.

""Essentially a two-hander concerning both prominent Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and hustler-turned-FBI-informant Bill O'Neal, 'Judas And The Black Messiah (2021)' tells one of the many frustrating tales surrounding the US government's shady but nowadays not-so-secret efforts to quash any form of racial equality within its jurisdiction. O'Neal is, for the most part, the piece's POV character, acting as a way for the audience see behind the scenes of both the Black Panther party and the FBI's efforts the crush it. That doesn't mean that Hampton is relegated to a lesser role, though; he dominates the screen whenever he's present, yet he's humanised in such a way that he comes across as much more than a series of rousing speeches and steadfast negotiations. Both characters are played almost to perfection, their respective actors - Kaluuya and Stanfield - encapsulating the dualities and nuances that the script demands. It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day. The narrative is really upsetting - angering, even - because it tells the tale of a total massacre of justice; the betrayals of the picture - which extend beyond its title's bold metaphor - hit you where it hurts. 7/10.""

""Kate Beckinsale tries to pull off a Charlize Theron in her latest sci-fi actioner (in the same universe as Crank) to middling results. Not that her arse-kicking is any less exciting. The awkward wig, cosmetics and the obvious presence of a stunt double aside, she's quite solid as this I-hate-people protagonist with an anger problem. But the central plot is so thin and unexciting that the only fun the film offers is in its fast-paced set-pieces. The core element of aggression (being subdued with the aid of mild electrocution) is simply used to deliver short and thrilling but generic pieces of action. The supporting acts (featuring the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney, and Bobby Cannavale) are just what they need to be. The writing (by Scott Wascha) is utterly weak, with a nonsensical plot, zero character development, and some really silly dialogue at times. Jolt is the kind of film that'll get erased from your mind pretty soon after you've seen it.""

""'Greetings from Lithuania.The first mistake of Host (2020) i think that in its 56 min. length it was hardly possible to establish 4 or 5 characters at the same time. There was only a situation and jump scares - and that is it, that is the whole thing (I can\'t even call it a full feature film). In Host you get a premise as old as a Blair Witch herself. And we have seen all this stuff being done so many times, and in a so many better horror film. Even a first Paranormal Activities movie was a masterpiece in comparison with this one, because it took its time to establish situation and characters. Unfortunately Host doesn\'t have any of this. And there is also one dude Teddy i think was his name, who was so obnoxious that i was pretty happy when he was out of the picture at the end so to speak - literally.Overall, Host isn\'t a terrible movie, and you can see an attempt to make something good on a very low budget and premise.

""A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E.

Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.I like the general premise and the place. I love Cage's obsessive cleaning although his character should start differently. Instead of a bad mother driving a muscle car, he should be a simple workman driving a beat-up truck. He should be poor which would explain him working as a janitor more easily. I like the teen group for the most part and they are good cannon fodder anyways. I like the animatronic killers although the killings get a bit repetitive. It's lots of fun the first time around but it gets a diminishing return with each kill. All in all, it's fun for awhile but the fun does diminish.""
""'I Care a Lot is a Comedy - Crime movie in which we watch a woman working as legal guardian and taking advantage of elderly people to drain their savings. A lot change when she does the same to another elderly woman but she is more than she appears.I liked this movie because it was different, it had an interesting plot and some good interpretations. The only thing I did not like it was the way the plot was presented and how it was changing through the whole duration of the movie. At first I though that it would be a crime, thriller movie but after some time I understood that it\'s a comedy. The interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Marla Grayson was simply amazing. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Peter Dinklage\'s who played as Roman Lunyov and Dianne Wiest\'s who played as Jennifer Peterson. To sum up, I have to say that I Care a Lot is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but do not expect much otherwise you will be disappointed.'""

""'Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed The New Mutants (2020) more then I thought I will be. Don\'t get me wrong - this isn\'t a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn\'t that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed The New Mutants as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible Dark Phoenix. This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it.'""
""'Or World War S for SUCKS, STUPID DECISIONS and SYFY-ENVY.I\'m not ready to call it, but I think Covld\'s killing cinema. I hated this movie. Like unbelievably hated it. And speaking of unbelievable, this movie\'s parents, 1998\'s Deep Impact and Armageddon, had enormously better special effects and those was decades ago.Mercifully, I only spent $3.99 on this rental, which coincidentally enough, was about half its budget. Still, I overpaid for this lazy, boring, unemotional mess of two actors sleepwalking through it and a kid who\'s more bipolar than Harvey Dent.This disaster film deals with every...single...clichÃÂ© but done without depth. Regardless, I suppose you\'re supposed to feel for the, of course, divorced parents of a diabetic child and their boring journey to the Title because a comet is set to destroy Planet Earth!I can\'t even comprehend the plot holes, predictable actions, the annoying characters, the needless sacrifices and the most amateur filmmaking since Battlefield Earth. And it really hurts that it\'s 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn\'t give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that\'s so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an Action Movie despite having Gerard Butler\'s name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you\'re probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER.'""
""'Greenland has a grand setting and engages enough, but lacks substance.The end of the world will bring anyone together, one minute it\'s awkward, the next together forever. Don\'t forget there\'s always crazies out there. It\'s like a small portion of War of the Worlds, really. At the start with the other families at their get together, everyone there knows they\'re the only ones selected. I don\'t believe them going to check for a second, leaving the Garrity\'s to pack, so they can then react, very convenient. Would have been much tougher had they not voluntarily left the house and had to pack with them there. I don\'t understand the anger though, seems like a civilized conversation. They know his profession and why\'s he\'s been selected, he didn\'t have a say, seems petty. The characterization\'s rather thin and performances not particularly memorable, but it\'s alright.'""
""It's been a while since I've seen a good comet disaster movie, so I was looking forward to 'Greenland'.Fortunately, 'Greenland' did not disappoint. The film is not as action-packed as 'Armageddon', since it focused more on the drama surrounding the disaster. The film also illustrated people's behavior during disaster, and the dire consequences of their actions, and humanity's inability to work together when disaster strikes.Within the first few minutes the film hit us with an overdone cliche: a disaster movie featuring yet another couple with marital problems who will - no doubt - be reunited due to the disaster. Fortunately, the rest of the film was not as cliched and a great depiction of human greed and selfishness.The suspense is elevated by our hero, John's son Nathan, who is diabetic. John and his wife, Allison, and son has been selected to be taken to an underground shelter. However, just before boarding the plane, Nathan forgets his insulin in the car. This sets off a series of events that throws their lives - and chances of survival - into turmoil. Thanks to good performances, this film felt realistic, and there's some excellent scenes of comet debris crashing to earth. 'Greenland' is an easy watch with a simple premise and no surprise twists.And who is to say this can't - or won't - happen?Would I watch it again? Possibly.""
""A group of terrorists take over a flight, unaware that a mother, travelling with her son, is a vampire and will do all that is necessary to protect him.This starts off quite well during the initial hijacking when the film is geared around the terrorists and the vampire sneaking around the plane taking them out. Things get a touch OTT when people start getting bitten and in turn becomes vampires. This is ok fun with buckets of blood, but it's too long, the kid is annoying and the frequent flashbacks showing how the woman became a vampire rather a dull diversion and quite unnecessary. Ok, sort of.""
""I tried to watch it all the way through, but I got the gist of it within ten minutes. The story is lacking any sort of purpose other than blood and gore. The characters are flat, undeveloped and with no direction. This is basically a copy cat movie of all those other movies where you have either an elevator, island, a boat or a building with infected people getting killed off one at a time. It's completely predictable and boring.""
""Oh dear. Despite reshoots and a huge amount of publicity here in the UK, the negative reviews kept coming for this film. And sadly in my opinion they are deserved.I'm not saying that the Rex Harrison original, or the Eddie Murphy films based on 'Dr Doolittle' were such classics that the character should be retired, but surely they could've done better than this.I didn't mind Robert D.J, I thought he was good, I didn't mind the Welsh accent, or even the overcomplicated story.What lets this film down is that despite copying the Eddie Murphy films example of having funny people do the animals voices, they get people who aren't funny. Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is.""
""'Dolittle is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a physician who has the ability of talking to animals going on a new adventure to find a legendary island with the help of his crew and a young boy.I enjoyed watching this movie but I believe that it didn\'t reach its potential or I had high expectations from it. I liked the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. who played as Dr. John Dolittle and it was something extremely different than his previous roles. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Harry Collett\'s who played as Tommy Stubbins and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan it was interesting but nothing more than this.Finally, I have to say that Dolittle is a good average movie to spend your time with but don\'t have high expectations from it because you are going to be let down by it.'""

""I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It takes place entirely in the Mariana Trench, almost 7 miles deep and with water pressures of over 15,000 psi. Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment. I replayed a couple of scenes with only my TV speakers on and all the great sound disappeared. It is a dramatic difference.""

The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good.

""Russo Brothers trying out new stuff after the MCU. The story is about the life of Cherry: his love life, military life, post-military life, and his demise.The first part of the movie was the weakest. It was loaded with voice over, breaking the fourth wall, and other styles that was meant to engage the audience. Even though I didn't mind them really much, I agreed that these stylistic choices were just there for the sake of substances. They didn't do much to enhance the meaning or themes of the movie.However, the second and third arcs became significantly better. They showed Cherry's life in the military and his use of drugs. Even though the plot type was done countless times before, I thought the Russo's brothers' execution was great. The third arc had a big Requiem for a Dream vibe, and it was pretty hard for me to watch some of the scenes.Tom Holland was marvelous at his role and he sold his character very well. At around the second and third arcs, he became much more serious and this is where he shined the most.Even though the movie was almost 2.5 hours, I didn't feel it was too long and I was hooked into the story. However, I wouldn't watch the movie again because of the length.Overall, an entertaining yet bit rough to watch at times. Quite a roller coaster. 8.5/10""

If they're cringeworthy, so too are the new cast members: hip young females who embarrass throughout, particularly the actress playing Reeves' daughter whose acting is pure caricature rather than performance.

""It's 1939 Suffolk, England. Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires local archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to dig some mysterious mounts of earth on her property.

He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine.""

""'You\'d get an ordinary movie seems to be the answer. It\'s certainly an odd reference to Superman--perhaps the strangest since DC\'s most beloved family farmers unexpectedly seemed to turn up in the Marvel movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). Seems weirder to me than even Brightburn (2019). That what appears to be the most remarkable thing about a production is that it casts the same duo, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who played Superman\'s adoptive parents in the latest DC cinematic incarnations, Man of Steel (2013) and so on, is an indication that not much interesting is going on here. It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn\'t help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, Let Him Go is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that\'s about it. There just isn\'t much going on in this superficial The Searchers (1956) retread--even if it is a period piece that covers issues of domestic abuse and mistreatment of Native Americans.

""'I don\'t have anything specific i hated about this movie. It just didn\'t do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn\'t make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what\'s happening in a scene. I\'m not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn\'t know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious.

""I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much.""
""Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains.

Another bad thing is visuals... well,when you see horror or action movie and some scenes look as fake as WWE RAW you know something is wrong with that. There are many plot holes. We still don\'t know why he killed those people at the beginning, who they were, what happened in his life that he is so unhinged. Ending was bad. Cops can\'t chase him, no one can find him and mom kills guy with scissors... That\'s HUGE No from me, I would never recommend to spend your time watching this film.'""
""Surprisingly, 'Bloodshot (2020)' isn't bad. It's sometimes genuinely enjoyable in a camp kind of way, especially in its opening moments, and it's often rather entertaining even when it isn't, for all intents and purposes, all that great. There's some decent action (as well as some not-so-decent action, of course), the performances are all pretty much on point and the narrative does a lot more than you'd expect it to. The movie has a number of generic twists and turns that are somewhat interesting in their execution and its visual effects are often rather impressive (though, again, they often aren't). Sure, the piece is cheesy and outdated, but it's actually kind of fun. However, there's always this element of mediocrity present. Even when you're entertained, you're always aware of some issue. That, along with the fact that it's only ever so good in the first place, makes for an experience that rests somewhere between 'alright' and 'good enough'. It helps that Vin Diesel is just an inherently funny human being, a bit of a walking meme. His presence definitely elevates this, even if it's difficult to put your finger on why exactly that is. Ultimately, this is a decent flick that does exactly what it needs to without taking itself too seriously. It's not great, but it's better than you'd think it would be. 6/10""
""'Unlike The Rhythm Section which was a more realistic tale of someone becoming a revenging superhero this script is straight out of comic book fantasy - no real here.

""Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here.

""While it is marketed as Train to Busan 2 and generally the promotion, I reckon especially internationally, tries to enamour people to watch this, it does a bit of a disservice to the movie. Yes this is losely connected to Train to Busan, as it plays years after that event (mostly). But it is not the same movie and it does not pander and just rehashes what the first one was. This is more of an action adventure with zombies. And some pathos and (melo)drama thrown in for good (or bad) measure.Not everything is great here of course and if you'd ask me which of the two movies I liked better, I'd go with the first one. Still and even though this has its flaws, it is more than entertaining. If you let yourself enjoy it and don't compare it too much or let some drama ruin it. Especially the ending may really make some people at least annoyed. Predictable as it is, it looks and sounds good and is the zombie ride anyone who doesn't mind some explicit gun violence on their screens.""
""Surprisingly good even for the overcooked zombie genre. Zombies were numerous; nicely cosmetically zombized with well chosen stunt zombies for expressions & contortions. Additional fight scenes between boring humans added spice to zombie meal. Car chase & zombie mowing added a nice flavorful topping to this movie meal. A few plot twists to keep us guessing. All with some, perhaps humorously, unlikely characterizations. CGI not the best, but good enough unless you're a picky eater.""
""I agree with those who feel cheated because this film lacks the effort to show us the personalities of those who made movies in the golden days. Mankiewicz is so random and so troubled that I couldn't get a real direction. From word one I had trouble feeling any sympathy for this man.

""As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10""

I watch Korean stuff to see Korean style and the usual quirkiness, not something that could have been churned out on a production line by Hollywood. Sure, the characters are likeable enough, but the rescue story is extremely basic and doesn't sustain the near two and a half hour running time, so this feels like it goes on forever. The CGI effects are nondescript and the cheesiness becomes all too apparent as it goes on, particularly in the ridiculous ending.

Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing.""
""OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this.""
""Jack Cunnigham (Ben Affleck) works construction and loves canned drinks, perhaps too much. He was a basketball player who has been asked to come back to high school and coach. We watch him swear at the kids and drink. He has anger and sorrow over a lost son and now a separated wife seeing a rich guy. The characters were not that great and we wait for the moment he realizes he has an alcohol problem and turns his life around. The event happens with 12 minutes of film left and doesn't do the film justice.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.""
""Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) is an alcoholic construction worker separated from his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a devastating tragedy. He is convinced to coach his alma mater Catholic high school Bishop Hayes basketball team. It's the site of his greatest glory where he threw away his potential and started a descent into addiction.As a sports underdog story, this is very standard and straight forward. The most non-standard aspect of that happens at the end when it stops short. It's also very stripped down. The kids would normally get more screen time. Only one kid gets a functional character progression. Mostly, this is compelling for Ben Affleck playing a struggling alcoholic and director Gavin O'Connor trying to strip him down to the studs. My only complaint about his part is that he needs to show his self-destructiveness more overtly in the beginning. He should start in a bad place and then recover over the movie until he starts backsliding. It doesn't need to be a mystery.""

""Here is a nice little story about a woman going to meet her girlfriend's parents for the first time without knowing if they will approve of the relationship or not. It was mostly entertaining, even though the girlfriend made so many outrageous choices that a real person would probably easily avoid. It kept my interest, but I didn't really feel the emotion between the two leads. It was a lukewarm romance at best. But generating onscreen passion wasn't really the point. It was about whether this woman would be willing to stay with someone who wasn't being true to herself or their feelings for one another. There was some enjoyable comedy and nice performances, but I don't see it becoming a holiday classic.""
""'Poor old \'Scoob!\'. Meant to be the grand launch of a \'Hanna Barbera Cinematic Universe\' released to great fanfare, due to the pandemic it ended up being shunted to VOD, released in cinemas in some countries, in others not, before ending up on DVD, where it probably has found its actual home.This isn\'t old-school \'Scooby Doo\'. The mystery element is sidelined, making way instead for super-heroes (because there hasn\'t been enough films about them recently...), A list voice actors taking over the roles from the folks who do the straight to DVD films, and a lot of pop culture gags that probably won\'t endear the film to future generations. Daddy, who\'s Kelly Clarkson? etc.It is however an awful lot of fun, I enjoyed it far more than I anticipated, and if you can embrace this new take, then you may well enjoy it too.I hope it does end up launching a shared universe series.'""

""This wasn't bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive,racist,dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea, they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion, they could've waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie, because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing.""

""'Brining awareness to psychological problems, issues and pressure (also from society), while making an at least somewhat interesting if not entirely entertaining movie, is quite a hard task. And I\'ll admit my inner cynic had some hills to climb, some flaws to swallow, to see and not be on the pessimistic, critic side of this movie.Having said all that and while it felt that Mr Pikachu (he\'s done other movies since and before that, but bare with me or endulge my joke at least) felt like most comfortable when he was the happy go lucky guy. Not the serious brooding, thoughtful, too much in his own head Dude. Or freak as some call him. I think that quite a lot of people will be able to relate to him. Not just since the Pandemic, but generally speaking. Elle Fanning might also be best, when she can show her joyful side, but she can be sad and introvert too.This really is a warning, a social message packed into a movie. Do not take anyone for granted. Talk to each other, enjoy life if you can. Try to stay positive, but even more importantly spread that message and even if you can\'t tell by looking at a person who\'s close to you, tell them what they mean to you.

""While the script is rife with monologues and exhausting rants about politics, art, and criticism, Sam Levinson's 'Malcolm & Marie' has little meaningful to say about anything.

Kids fantasy transformed in a movie and I don't against the concept for relaxing once a while. But literally kids have judgement on what's right or can do? Really no! This movie tried to tell even a yes day could be a nightmare. I can't take it even when watch they behave in the movie.
""Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie.

Unfortunately, the film\'s inability to choose a strong position about its protagonists (brave & important, or immature & silly?) makes it feel irresponsibly glib.'""

It culminates in a violent confrontation.This is an indie horror directed by Dave Franco. The story is fine for a striped down horror. I would let Josh kill the man rather than engineer the death. It's meant to alleviate the guilt from him when that's not really necessary. Nobody likes him in the first place. It works a lot better if the extra element is kept off screen for awhile longer. Let the four characters cook in their own juices. The bubbling relationship between these four is the best aspect of this movie.The movie's main difficulty lies in its director. Franco lacks the specific horror action skills. Non of the kills are exciting. The horror could be much scarier. Running at the car window is probably the only good horror shot and that scene is cut short. The body on the cliff would be terrific visual if Franco could incorporate more vertigo into the shots. If you're crashing a car anyways, let's flip it for more exciting crash action. Franco doesn't have the required skills to elevate the horror thriller aspect.""

The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel.

His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard.

""Some might find the level of cruelty displayed in this movie unrealistic even for a story about a genocide but historical records prove that deep indoctrination and conditioning is in fact capable of completely desensitizing human beings and turn them into cold killing machines.The main virtue of this movie is exactly that.That other than momentarily expressed nervous reflexes there is absolutely no hesitation, no remorse, no empathy displayed by the personnel running the camp.The lesson/warning/message : a process like this doesn't run its course overnight, let's all be vigilant and recognize the signs of something like this about to take place and stop it before it's too late.""

""'The Lovebirds (2020)' is a perfectly fine comedy focused around a couple who are drawn into a vague criminal plot that may just be the key to saving their relationship. Needless to say, it's pretty generic. It's also rather unmemorable. The plot is almost as barebones as possible when it comes to its central mystery, which never really resolves - at least, not satisfyingly - and only serves to get the focal couple from set-piece to set-piece. However, some of those set-pieces are enjoyable and everything is competently constructed. The two leads do a decent job with the banter, bickering and obviously improvised observations that comprise most of the run-time. They're not the most charismatic duo but they're easy to root for and are affable enough, making decisions that mostly make sense in-the-moment and living in a relatively grounded world. The film is intermittently chuckle-worthy and it's breezy enough, to boot. It isn't all that atmospheric or compelling, but it's entertaining enough when it gets going. There's just about enough here to adequately pass the time; just don't expect to remember it in the morning. 6/10""
I think Prabhudeva is in too hury to direct this movie I don't know what's the rush. The story of this movie is going on a speed that we can't even imagine I don't know what's the rush not even single scenerio is good. And the background music of this movie is so irritating that I could feel like my ears are gonna go deaf. In the name of Acting all the actors have done overacting.

""I wasn't that much of a fan of the first movie but I still had hopes this for this movie. Whilst it isn't a bad movie, it definitely is a step down from the first movie.Unless you've escaped a mental asylum or on more drugs than all the riverdale writers put together, you shouldn't like the very uncharismatic Noah Centineo. He tries his best but he cones of so bland. He seriously effects the film and the chemistry with Lana Condor. Lana Condor is really great as is Jordan Fisher when they are on the screen, it becomes more investing.My issue is that Lana Condor was a refreshingly different character in the first movie but here she feels like the other movies, the first movie didn't try to be. That being the film is sweet enough despite being riddled with more cliches than your typical teen film. The ending however is a let down.That being said it is an enjoyable film which does have a lot of charm and heart but it just doesn't stand out that much. It is still worth watching and it's not exactly a bad film. I hope if they do a third movie I seriously hope it is better.""

""You know what to expect when you watch a Vijay movie. The only difference from the usual Vijay movies is the space given to Bhavani(Vijay Sethupathi).\nI didn't have much expectations so the movie was not disappointing.\nI felt like the script needed so much refinement.\nFirst of all, they should stop treating Vijay as a superstar within the movie. He should play the character not Vijay. The choreography in dance numbers were really disappointing. I'm waiting(pun not intended) for a dance number like Ella Pugazhum. Andrea's character is an example of poor writing. They just placed the archery scene for the sake of that chase. It could've been executed better. And Gayathri should've been just another teacher who plays an important role in the plot. Making her fall in love with Vijay was really cringe. Songs were poorly placed. Especially Antha Kanna Pathakka. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I expected better action scenes too. Vijay is one of the best(and few) Indian actor who can easily handle action.\nIt's Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani who steals the show. He's brilliant and terrifying villain who talks in a polite manner. The way he belittles the protagonist's emotions was really good. It's the long and nearly ridiculous scenes in the climax what kills the mood.""

""'James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M\'s instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system Nine Eyes looking to shut down 00. Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra\'s funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (LÃÂ©a Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization.With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He\'s a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he\'s not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It\'s missing something. It\'s missing greatness. It\'s missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don\'t really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest.'""
""'Spectre', much like 'Quantum of Solace', has to follow a game changing Bond film, and comes up short.It's hard to say why. All the ingredients that made 'Skyfall' good are retained here, but the story never quite gels, the set pieces veer from silly to stupendous, and at the centre of it all we have Daniel Craig who looks a bit bemused (and dare I say bored) by it all.The tone is off too. Ok, Craig is never going to be a pun heavy Bond like Roger Moore, but his delivery of the 'comedy' aspects is almost delivered through gritted teeth.It's also a violent film indeed, how it was only a 12A is shocking. Eye gouging, suicide, torture- a trip to the cinema with the kids this was not.It all makes for a muddled Bond film, that has now has its ending spoilt, because despite Craig saying he'd never return to the role, come Spring he's back again.Can't wait after this...""
""'This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele\'s song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed Skyfall a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film.'""
""'After the Bond begins movie with Daniel Craig (also known as Casino Royal), I came to terms into where Bond was moving to. And watching Jason Bon... ah sorry I mean James Bourne of course. No, but seriously, after many years, where Bond was the one that got copied, Bond now tries to stay in touch with the times and went air-bo(u)rne (pun intended).You can hold it against this movie, as well as the fact, that Bond never get\'s to say his name on-screen (Bond. James Bond), but does that really matter? For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn\'t much of a plot here ... it\'s a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that. I did like the movie, because I got my head around one thing ... to rephrase a quote: Bond is dead, long live the (new) Bond! I\'m not that excited about the whole thing yet, but maybe after the third one, I will be! And a movie that get\'s that much attention and get\'s discussed and even taken apart by some, has to have something going for it.'""

""'Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it\'s not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of show, don\'t tell, by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don\'t mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.'""
""'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10.""

I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances.

The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up.

""'In 1982, Ridley Scott released Blade Runner, based on Philip K. Dick\'s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. It had two focuses. One was the question of what makes us human, as the protagonist (Harrison Ford) starts to question his order to capture the renegade replicants. The other was the look at a dystopian future, as there\'s no connection to the natural world and the population gets bombarded by advertising everywhere.Now, Incendies and Arrival director Denis Villeneuve has released a sequel: Blade Runner 2049. The sequel expands on the original\'s dystopian focus, as anyone with the economic means has departed the moribund planet. A new corporation has replaced the one from the original movie, and has continued making replicants. A new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is the protagonist here, but there\'s more than meets the eye.The visuals are impressive.

It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears.

""'A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed The Zodiac is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who\'s employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper\'s reporting of (and the police department\'s concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith\'s non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it\'s quite riveting.

""First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers.""

""'The first 80-90% of Interstellar I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn\'t make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It\'s sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful Gravity, it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it\'s a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.'""
""'Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they\'re supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth\'s Knock Knock is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of Grindhouse (Tarantino\'s collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the \'70s), and then co-starred in Inglourious Basterds as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of Citizen Kane and Dr. Strangelove. If Knock Knock is any indication, Roth\'s own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.'""

There comes a certain amount of Blind Allegiance to keep Supporting the Ultra-Unsatisfying Stuff He puts out.In this one Keanu Reeves Strains. Some of His Speeches are Cringe-Inducing to Say the Least.

If I didn\'t know better I\'d think that they were real people  This isn\'t how things work out and would have perhaps have been preferable to what we have here Effectively this HOUSE OF WAX is yet another long line of horny teenagers in peril which died out sometime in the late 1980s . It\'s easy to understand why because there\'s not a lot of mileage to the formula especially to someone who grew up with this type of movie . If there\'s anything that differentiates it from so many films of this genre it\'s got some graphic torture porn and is a bit more graphic than the norm but even then that\'s only damning praise .

""House of Wax (2005) * 1/2 (out of 4) The second remake of Michael Curtiz's Mystery of the Wax Museum is updated to today's times and features six teens stranded in a small town where two psycho brothers are turning people to wax. I'm all for remakes when they can get things right but that's not the case here. There aren't any scares and the first hour is downright boring. I guess the filmmakers were wanting to go back to the 80's slashers but you don't go an hour without any action. When the thing finally picks up it's not too bad and there's some nice twists that happen to our main hero, which isn't normal for this type of film. I can't say I'm a fan of Paris Hilton but she actually did the best job out of the cast. If you need to see wax then check out one of the previous two films. Although the film borrows heavily from those two films this here is more in line with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

""Unlike the 1984 David Lynch film, this one is the correct length and therefore all the more elaborate than the aforementioned version. And because of that, there is more character development and story. But that said, this version I have to say is anemic when compared to the 1984 film version. Here are my reasons: there is no memorable music (unlike the original version which featured a superb score by Toto or Children of Dune which featured a memorable score by Brian Tyler), the acting was okay when compared to the original (there's no Patrick Stewart per say), and the visual effects was far inferior to either the 1984 version and Children of Dune. So, all in all, this film is an okay adaptation of Frank Herbert's beloved novel though it is much more elaborate than the 1984 film version.""

""You never know - usually it is not good for anything. Especially when it comes to single man missions. And this has the backdrop of real war (written all over it).

I mean there is one moment where we go completely dark, so ... and there is always a possibility to cut. But they swear they didn't do it here, so let's take that at face value.The effects are great, the cinematography was a shoe in for the Academy Award ... and it won. Not a surprise. Having said that, there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat.

""Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes.""
""A PG-rated Battle Royale. The Running Man with mood swings and acne. The mere thought of a Hollywood adaptation of the latest novel to grace every teenagers' bookshelf was enough to make me shudder in fear (I've seen Twilight; that was enough for me). How could they possibly make this derivative, undoubtedly tame, and probably sappy nonsense appeal to anyone other than hormonal adolescents? Amazingly, they have.I've just finished watching The Hunger Games with my 11-year-old daughter (who kindly gave me a running commentary on exactly how the film compares with the book) and was amazed at just how much I enjoyed its grim dystopian visionÃ¢ÂÂa post apocalyptic world where freaky future-folk with crazy multi-coloured hair happily watch a group of kids killing each other with a variety of sharp/pointy things in an arena where genetically altered killer wasps, computer-controlled forest fires, and mutant man-eating dogs also present a very real danger.With decent direction from Gary Ross, a fine central performance from the rather lovely Jennifer Lawrence (who reminds me of a young Renee Zellweger, which ain't a bad thing), plus memorable supporting turns from Woody Harrelson (so cool), Isabelle Fuhrman (so scary), and Donald Sutherland (so loathsome), I have to admit that the film was a lot more fun than I expected it to be.""
""Somehow I have my doubts as to whether Diablo Cody's Oscar for Juno's screen play is going to be joined by one for Jennifer's Body. Where Juno was a breath of fresh air, Jennifer's Body is a cheerfully trashy and utterly familiar high school teen horror with a dash of comedy thrown in.Megan Fox is, of course, the main attraction. She gets to say some raunchy dialogue and to tease the male element of the audience as much as some of her victims. But I haven't yet seen anything showing she can act - here she is required to pout, smoulder and be generally sultry and provocative, all things which come fairly naturally out of what she looks like. What she isn't required to do, however, is demonstrate any real acting ability. And I couldn't see a great deal of difference between her character before and after the demon took up residence in her.Amanda Seyfried has the meatier role, and attacks it with relish.The script is functional and, in places, fun.The horror element is satisfactory and the ending is not bad.The film overall is, of its kind, undemanding fun.""

There are also other threads running through this very busy horror film.I\'m going to be honest and say that I don\'t know what I think of this film. Its certainly good, but I went to it hearing about how great and wonderful it was that seeing it I was rather disappointed. To me there are a some chills but no real scares. I think the fragmented nature, the film bounces backward and forward through the night , hurts the film in that no story builds up momentum enough to be truly scary. Don\'t get me wrong the film is full of neat ideas, good looking monsters, great performances and some nice EC Comics style twists, but it just didn\'t scare me.

The interrogation room scene comes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes from Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best performance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller Dover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally dangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does let him escape morally a little too easily.Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has fashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly. It's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm not going deduct any points for that.""

""I won't labor on the plot, but will just make a few comparisons. The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better. This reboot is superior to the initial in every way.Guide: F-words.

""IT is the first of a two-part modern reworking of the Stephen King classic, first adapted for the screen with the miniseries back in 1990. I like the miniseries a lot, and Tim Curry's interpretation of Pennywise remains definitive, but the 2017 IT is surprisingly decent. It has a far more adult edge than the miniseries, and it's much, much darker. It seems to capture the dark heart of the King novel very well, the very essence of it, while the real asset lies in the all-child cast; the performances are generally excellent, going for realism over sympathy or sentiment and feeling very true to life as a result. The scares are well telegraphed and perhaps a little too inevitably reliant on CGI trickery, but for a modern horror they're quite effective. I didn't mind the updating to the 1980s setting either as it makes sense to follow King's trend of setting the past scenes 27 years before the present day. Despite the flaws I found this to be one of the stronger horror films to come from Hollywood in recent years; there's something pleasingly old-fashioned about a film that emphasis strong plotting rather than a series of jumps or chases descending into tedium.""
""'it has the gift to become a personal story. because it is a film about dreams, about past, about memories who could stop or rule the present. in same measure, it is an ambitious project. maybe to ambitious because the story becomes a huge map in which plains and seas are mixed. not the last, it is one of demonstration of the art of Leonardo diCaprio. beautiful, precise but, maybe, too obvious. the original theme - the mind control - becomes an unlimited labyrinth. a story about spies becomes a psychological one. all in a oppressive rhythm, with explanations who are status of parts of lesson, with different levels who transforms it in a kind of video game. but its virtue is to be perfect choice for different viewers. and this does it great.'""

While it tries hard to get as many laughs as possible out of that concept, it is doomed to fail (in my eyes) from the get go. Spoofing a movie, that is already a funny/cynical take on the horror movies, doesn\'t really quite work as good as it should. In contrast to classics, such as Airplane!, where the object/movie that\'s being spoofed took itself seriously, Scream was meant to be funny. So how many jokes can there be?

""'This film is about a freed slave partnering with a bounty hunter to seek revenge and free his wife.Django Unchained is a action western, but it is far too long to be interesting and engrossing. At almost three hours, it is a struggle to follow the story and keep being interested in it. There is far too much dialog to be an action film. For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours.

""'If you\'re familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of Thirtysomething, My So-Called Life, Relativity, and Once and Again, you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That\'s the case with this movie that they\'re also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who\'s always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I\'ll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film\'s story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?'""
""'The movie starts out as a great man\'s comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics.

His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson\'s disease which is why she is a free spirit.Jake falls in love, turning this into Love Story, then the comedy simply dies.Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb.'""
""'It seems like a no-brainer to me that an adult sex comedy should first and foremost be sexy. But director Edward Zwick and his writers must disagree with me, because, abundance of Anne Hathaway\'s boobies and the seemingly endless scenes of naughtiness between her and Jake Gyllenhaal aside, I found little to titillate me in this droopy comedy.Hathaway, though a fine actress, has absolutely zero sex appeal, so she\'s a terrible choice for this role. And it doesn\'t help that she has no chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Therefore, the entire movie\'s bottom falls out from under it, because the whole point is that these two oversexed young \'uns with a fear of commitment (he because he\'s a mimbo, she because she\'s got a degenerative disease) find in each other the soul mate who makes all the hard things about relationships that they\'ve been trying to avoid worth dealing with. It\'s hard to believe these two are soul mates when they have about as much romantic spark between them as I have with my own sister.Edward Zwick has long held a place in my top 5 list of least favorite directors, and this movie didn\'t do much to change his ranking.Grade: C'""
""A fairly standard romance. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a representative (i.e., salesman) for Pfizer who meets up with Anne Hathaway in a doctor's office and falls for her. At first he just assumes she's a prescription medicine junky (which he obviously doesn't look down on, since he's pretty much just a pusher). It turns out, though, that she really does have Parkinson's disease and is refusing to let him get closer to her because she doesn't want to hurt him (or be hurt by him if he runs away when things get too rough). The film does work, though, mostly because Hathaway is excellent. Gyllenhaal's pretty good, too. You also get some good supporting performances from people like Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt and Judy Greer. One big negative aspect: Gyllenhaal's fat, obnoxious younger brother played by Josh Gad. I think they wanted to cast Jonah Hill, but he was too big a star for such a role. Gad is a lookalike with about half as much talent. But, really, the flaw is mostly in the writing. The guy's a pretty poor excuse for comic relief. He does completely unbelievable things (like masturbating to a sex tape starring his brother and his brother's girlfriend, then, when getting caught, asking his brother how his penis got so big?!?!), and his joke lines are completely unfunny.""

Creasy is against it at first, and when he does accept with nothing better to do, he is at first in no mood to socialise with Pita, but she does slowly get him to open up to her. But Creasy's new found purpose is taken away when Pita is kidnapped, and he is now out to kill anyone involved with or profiting from the kidnapping. Also starring Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano, Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Mariana, JesÃÂºs Ochoa as Fuentes, Mickey Rourke as Jordan Kalfus and Angelina PelÃÂ¡ez as Sister Anna.

Washington plays a Jack Daniels guzzling former CIA agent who reads the Bible. His partner, Christopher Walken, lands him a job guarding Dakota Fanning (Pita). Early in the movie we find out every rich person in Mexico hires a body guard, then gets kidnapping insurance from AIG for 10 million dollars, which the kidnappers know about. This sets you up for the expected plot twists which were not terrific.Denzel doesn\'t want to get friendly with Dakota, but ends up becoming her friend, father, swimming coach, chauffeur, etc. etc. Dakota Fanning gets kidnapped (box information). Denzel uses his CIA walking tall methods to go after the bad guys, which includes half of Mexico. The substandard script, slow beginning, and questionable ending took away from the production.The ending should have included a dramatic escape by Fanning involving her ability to swim as the movie centered so much on this aspect of her life.'""

""How do people who only watch this one entry feel about it? I reckon dissatisfied. Because the movie is only part of something bigger and tough to just judge on its own merits. Having said that, I personally feel it works as a standalone too - like a tv show that cuts off and leaves you out in the cold in the end - but was really good up to that point.In this case you have the choice to watch more and get a ... as some say fresh take on the slasher genre. Because while this kind of feels like a slasher movie ... it isn't. And you can tell early on, that there is more. It is only visual and it's a bit of a cheat (all things considering), but it does make sense - yes suspend your disbelief! You have to, no doubt about it.Another thing that there is no doubt about: you can't be squeamish! While there is nothing much here when it comes to nudity (and only a small amount of what could be called sexy time), there is a lot of blood and violence!

""'Bleak and brooding, The Lighthouse is a study of the descent into madness of two lighthouse keepers, stranded beyond their original four week assignment, and despairing in the fate of their existence together. Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Tom Howard (Robert Pattinson) are alternately at each others\' throats or gleefully imbibing their way into a state of stupor, at one point suggesting a homoerotic encounter, but quickly devolving into yet another fit of pique. Of the two, it\'s Pattinson\'s character who eventually experiences visions and nightmares as he goes about his daily chores, subservient to the demands of his nominal supervisor Wake. Cinematically, the picture reminded me of all those great black and white films of the Thirties and Forties emanating from the silent era. It even has a \'B\' quality look, though the subject matter goes beyond the simplistic efforts of early film, and challenges the viewer with a myriad of interpretations one could assign to the story. That the fate of the two men ends so tragically is no wonder given the exposition, and you\'ll come away convinced that it\'s bad luck to kill a seabird.'""
""OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.So-so. The movie LOOKS good (the deserted vessel is impressive) but the story is slow and the characters are never fully realized. Also top billed Gabriel Byrne (giving a terrible performance) is hardly in the movie. On the plus side Julianna Margulies is good and a strong female character (unusual in any horror movie) and Alix Dimitriades and Ron Eldard are good as members of the crew. Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. But the slow pace and a predictable and stupid ending sinks this (sorry). I can only give this a 5.""

""'What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation?

""I despise David Lynch's Dune. In my not so very humble opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen. It is utterly nonsensical and impossible to follow, the actors are almost all miscast (except for Sting, Dean Stockwell, and Patrick Stewart, who all mainly work as novelty), and the visuals are hideous. I also tried reading the novel once, but got bored after the first chapter.So when a friend asked me whether I wanted to watch the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries of Dune, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the whole thing. By the end of the first episode of three I was impressed at the technical side of the film. Vittorio Storaro, the same cinematographer who photographed Apocalypse Now and Reds, did an amazing job on this film, even if the visuals do go overboard sometimes. The gimmicks that the filmmakers employed most often worked well, especially the bizarre primary color lighting schemes. By the second episode, I felt I new the plot. By the end of the series, I felt that I knew the characters. While the narrative is still choppy and sometimes hard to follow (the biggest problem is that there are far too many characters in it), it ultimately works well. I felt that I had finally seen what Dune fanatics were raving about. This series is great. See it and forget that David Lynch ever dirtied his hands with his version.""
""More so than with the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield takes on the Spider-Man character, it appears that the Tom Holland version is geared more toward a teen and young adult audience. Nothing wrong with that, because alter-ego Peter Parker is a teenager himself. But it just doesn't feel like a super-hero movie for me with all the high school kids running around and Spider-Man trying to get out of a world threatening assignment from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever. As a completist I'll be on board for future movies, though I'd like to see more in the way of character development and effective story telling. A little bit darker tone would also be of help.""

Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.The first Zombieland, released in 2009, was great. The plot was a bit random (though its rambling nature had a certain charm) but it was the dialogue that made it so good: very funny and delivered perfectly. Some other great comedic devices rounded off a very funny movie.Zombieland: Double Tap follows in these footsteps with some great lines and comedic moments. Woody Harrelson (as Tallahassee), Emma Stone (Wichita), Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) are in fine form again. Zoey Deutch is great as the beautiful but dim-witted Madison.The film does struggle a bit towards the end though. For 80% of its duration it was a great comedy with very little ambition to be a serious zombie-drama but towards the end it starts to take itself too seriously. What follows is a fairly conventional and flat period of action-drama. Almost made me knock the film down to a 7. Stuck with the 8, but a weak 8.""

I don't know if the movie was poorly written, poorly executed or just a bad idea altogether but I did not like it.The cast were A listers: Owen Wilson, Christina Applegate and the up and coming Jason Sudeikis, yet there was no synergy between them. Furthermore, I think Owen Wilson was outside of his element. I don't think Owen Wilson has much range as and actor. Some roles fit him and others don't; this role didn't fit him. I first saw Jason Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses and I was impressed. I don't think he did a bad job in this movie, but I stopped it during the Jason Sudeikis self-pleasuring scene. The movie was already teetering on mediocrity before that and that scene did it for me.The Farrelly brothers are superb writers and I'm sure they'll bounce back, but this was a swing and a miss.

They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they\'re over and hope you\'ll be so dazzled that you\'ll forget any crappy parts.

""It's very clear that the MCU was greatly influenced by the success of Deadpool. What do I mean by that? Well, Deadpool was largely a comedy with action or an action comedy (however you choose to define it) and it seems that Thor: Ragnarok followed the same mold (less the abundant profanity).The question is: did it work? Judging by the amount of laughter I heard in the packed theater... yes. As for myself... not so much. It was entertaining and I did chuckle a few times myself, but I could have sufficed with fewer laughs and a little more substance. I was not that impressed with the nemesis, Hela (Cate Blanchett), with no onus on Cate because she's great. Hela just wasn't an interesting enough or captivating enough foe. And while I have generally loved Hulk's roles in the two Avenger movies, he was too cartoonish in Thor: Ragnarok. I mean he was literally more cartoonish instead of the more lifelike look he had in the other movies and he was more cartoonish in his behavior.I love the crossovers that Marvel does now (adding other Marvel characters) and that does boost its overall enjoyment value. There were some added characters around Thor in this movie that was nice. But boiling the movie down to the story and the execution of that story, it was more ehh. It was still entertaining and a fun night at the movies but not MCU good.""
""CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.""
""Kong is being kept under-the-dome living on Skull Island and he's not happy about it. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is trying to keep him safe and away from Godzilla. Her adopted deaf daughter Jia communicates with him. Meanwhile, conspiracy blogger Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is investigating and working at Apex Cybernetics. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander SkarsgÃÂ¥rd) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.Honestly, I don't remember the previous movies. I don't know any of these characters. Non of them really matters anyways. I do like the idea of the little girl communicating with Kong. The movie should do more of that. BTH is a little fun as the conspiracy nut. His little Scooby gang has potential but it's not that great. The Hollow Earth is rather silly but whatever. It's stupid but kinda cool at the same time. The TRON ships are out of place. It's a tech mishmash. I don't really need a lot of the human story especially if it's not doing anything interesting. At the end of the day, this is a mindless popcorn flix and it's fine for being that.""
""'They took the Kong from Skull Island, an excellent film plus the recent less than excellent Godzilla film and smashed them together into a confused mess. They simply tried to do too much. They take the basic titan fight and added Journey to the Center of the Earth, Upside Down Kong as Indian Jones, Transformers, a light saber Ax, teens save the world, and a little girl saves the world. The company Apex are the bad guys who are trying to do something good. Good visuals. Just a messed up plot.'""
""GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love. I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit. There are flashes of strong material, including a very nasty gore scene, but they come few and far between.""

""This was an unexpected gem. I guessed I had heard a few good things about it, but I expected something at least decent. The film is actually very good, with a fantastic lead performance at its core. The premise is a simple one that could have not worked at all, but the film is crafted with such care by Mike Flanagan and it really shows. The only flaw I would point out would be the final scenes. Something about their execution didn't work completely for me. Other than that, definitely a film to be recommended.""

The action scenes were stupid and too repetitive (too much of the same kind of action.) Yet, to point out the good as well as the bad, the car chase was spectacular. The film also went on a bit too long. It would have been better with some of those action scenes lessened.I had heard the story was very poor, but I didn't find it that bad. However, there is too much technical talk. Who can understand half of the mumbo-jumbo espoused in here?""
""For many 'The Holiday' has joined the ranks of Christmas classic's in terms of films. I wish them well with this but for me this is an average film that is made marginally better by an all-star cast, who seem to be having a better time than the audience.It's trying to be like 'Love Actually', it's trying to be sweet and romantic, but in the end I just didn't buy into Jack Black's character, or the one played by Kate Winslet.It has it's moments, but for me they are far and few between in an overly long film that could've been over and done with in 90 minutes tops.But it's Christmas, we are kinder to films that are trying to entertain us. Even if this one tries too hard.""
""'Another serial killer movie more Se7en than Zodiac but nowhere near as fresh as either despite having three Oscar-winning actors heading the cast. An unusually subdued Denzel Washington is the slightly grizzled older cop, (been there, done that), Rami Malek is the young detective desperate to shake off any resemblance to Freddie Mercury and Jared Leto is the probable killer. It\'s a slow, handsome-looking film, so determined not to be sensational that it veers towards the dull side. The writer and director is John Lee Hancock so I guess the blame lies largely with him.Denzel\'s character, the great detective whose intuation is almost superhuman, is a cliche too far; he\'s now the right age to channel his inner Morgan Freeman while Malek is just sleep-walking through his role. Leto, however, is outstanding, giving the movie a much needed kick as well as a touch of class, acting his co-stars off the screen though that fine and underrated actor Terry Kinney gives a lift to his few scenes as Malek\'s boss. Still, despite the cast and John Schwartzman\'s superb cinematography this could be just another episode of C.S.I. Crime Scene. A real disappointment.'""
""What was that??? this movie makes you appreciate things in movies that you normally take for granted. so many aspects of this movie are incompetent. the musical score is almost non-existent except for one theme they use during scene transitions. the story, which is already completely basic, is told in such an awkward and discombobulated way. so many things were confusing, not because they were too complex, but because they just didn't flow right.but the worst parts of this movie were a combination of the editing and the dialogue. it was soooooo awkward throughout. there were numerous times where i couldn't tell who was talking. there were scenes where one person was talking but the sound and volume completely changed between sentences. and the strangest thing was the flow of the conversations. the pauses between characters speaking was so odd. it's like they wanted to have fast quippy conversations, but they accomplished this by cutting out the gaps between responses. one character would respond IMMEDIATELY after the other finished his line. it sounded so unnatural. i repeated so many parts to confirm. it happened throughout the movie.other than being an extremely low-quality movie in every aspect except the cast, this movie was just boring with zero intrigue that goes nowhere interesting.

""The Little Things is the worst film Denzel's been involved in, unless he did a comedy with Kevin Hart of course.I don't even know what this is... they both killed someone, the end. This Malek guy's terrible, he just stares the whole time, like one of Michael Shannon's expressions. I fear for the upcoming Bond film he'll be in, the weak dialogue and woeful direction didn't help. Jim gets into the car and then does whatever Albert wants him to do until he becomes enraged. Albert could have killed him at any time as well. Such an empty nothing of a film.""
""Actually it would be more, don't yell anything or a word, but you get what I'm saying anyway. This builds tension and has a very succesful part towards the end of the movie. But the build is a bit ... well yes there is a shock moment with which the movie begins. Something that while you kind of expect it, you still may be baffled they went with it.Having said, after that punch in the gut, we get a slower pace and approach, but with quite a few holes in the story or rather the way the characters interact. Maybe it's good for the tension not to have a soundproof room, but when it comes to logic, you do wonder how suicidal that makes the characters ... Also a big reveal towards the end might make you go: Really? No one else discovered this? For fans this may feel like nitpicking and let's be clear, this is a good movie overall. But having so many things that feel convinient and don't make too much sense, take a bit away from the greatness the movie could have had - imho that is of course. Still a sequel is coming - surprise surprise (not)""

""Could it be that the less sense a movie makes, the better it's ranking here on IMDb? As I write this, the film is #93 on IMDb's Top #250. I've already ranted enough in other reviews to explain my position on this regarding new releases, so I won't bore you with it here. My main problem with the picture is that there doesn't seem to be an inherent logic to the story line. Linguist Louise Brooks (Amy Adams) makes significant inroads into understanding an alien language configured in Rorschach-like circles, and as the viewer, we're never really privy to how she managed to do it. The non-linear time element introduced into the story is quite bewildering as well, highlighted by Adams' character placing a phone call to a Chinese general AFTER he showed her his phone number, some time in the FUTURE! There are going to be those who hail this movie as brilliant film making, but I have to tell you, if I have to have it explained to me, then it doesn't pass a basic test for telling a good story. Namely a picture with a solid beginning, middle and end.""

""I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good.""

""Let me state right off the bat that I like both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I loved them both in Wedding Crashers. That was a very funny movie. This one, not so much, and because it's rated PG-13 and not R, there isn't as much raunch as in WC. Actually, this one is supposed to be even more of a nice vibe between comedy and sweetness than WC and I actually liked that. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I didn't find much that was funny during many of the beginning scenes. It did pick up much near the end and overall, The Internship wasn't too bad. Part of me wouldn't even mind seeing it again if asked. Just don't expect a non-stop laugh-getter is all I'm sayin'...""

But Anna wants out - could the CIA provide her with an exit route?If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Nikita, anyone? As an action/suspense thriller, Anna is fine, if unoriginal. It is a simple story, needlessly complicated by unnecessary and confusing flashbacks - Five Years Ago, Two weeks Ago, Three Years ago... only a couple of these flashbacks actually need to be flashbacks in that they contain a payoff which would spoil a chronologically subsequent moment.Newcomer Sasha Luss is decorative, deals well with the action, and shoots more people than John Wick. The rest of the cast are reliable, although Luke Evans has an air of feeling miscast.""
""After a flaccid opening half-hour, this slick, globe-trotting rehash by Luc Besson of his earlier hit 'Nikita' nostalgically set in the dying days of the Cold War develops an extremely dry sense of humour with the entrance of Helen Mirren (real name Mironoff) having a rare old time in ugly spectacles as the chain-smoking love child of Quasimodo and Rosa Klebb; and the beginning of the killing spree that comprises most of the rest of the film.The violence - as is usual with Besson - is sexier than the sex, and the film manages the odd surprise with the aid of an interesting flashback structure, with Mirren satisfyingly getting the last word.""

""'Jordan Peele has been famous as part of the comedy team Key & Peele. It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie, but he did.

Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry\'s songs but would\'ve refused to let him come into their businesses? I don\'t know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but I won\'t deny that it\'s one of the cleverest things that I\'ve seen all year. A mixture of horror, drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama\'s election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).Good movie.'""

The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving.

The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do.

""Having seen quite a few of Wes Anderson's movies, I knew to expect a certain rhythm and flow concerning characterizations and story. So I knew that most of the characters will speak in a certain clipped tone that never wavers and certain jump cuts were also expected. Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time. So on that note, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel if you don't mind such an unusual experience of a noncommercial nature.""

And it is also open to be viewed, liked or hated in any way the viewer sees fit. It will annoy a lot of people, but it also will delight a lot of people.

When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used.

He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, butter wouldn\'t melt image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn\'t really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by Bambi back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare light - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions.'""

Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one.""
""'Without a doubt, Frances McDormand has been one of the greatest US actresses of the past three decades. Humble and unglamorous, she\'s the opposite of the stereotypical movie star, making her Oscar wins all that more important. So it\'s no surprise that she now stars in ChloÃÂ© Zhao\'s Nomadland, as a laid-off woman traversing the western US. McDormand put so much effort into the role that many of her co-stars - many of whom aren\'t professional actors - didn\'t know that they were working with a professional actress.I\'ve heard of ChloÃÂ© Zhao for a few years, but this is the first movie of hers that I\'ve seen. I now want to see her other movies. This is simply an excellent movie. The performances, as well as the use of visuals combine to create a look at the effects that the Great Recession had on countless people. Everyone should see this movie.'""
""'Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.'""
'The world is split into five parts named after a dragon. It is in ruins and dying as druuns (purple Death Eaters) are turning people to stone. Princess Raya must play Tomb Raider to recover the gems and save the world. But first she must find the dragon. It won\'t be easy as no one wants to give up their piece of the gem.The film is only mildly Asian in tradition. The language is modern English slang. Raya\'s eyes are almost round. Sisu (the villain) has more slanted eyes. Doesn\'t Disney know to end the stereotype? The ending reminded me a little of Guardians of the Galaxy minus the dance off.'
""Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has.""
""'The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book\'s hero from my childhood. The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi\'s movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): O Espetacular Homem-Aranha (The Spectacular Spider- Man)'""
""Spoilers herein.I'm very easy to please when it comes to stuff like this, especially if it successfully and visually builds a world of mood. I give special consideration to first-time competence, and am especially interested in projects Barrymore sponsors. I love time folding, self-reference and narrative challenges. I really enjoy films whose narrative depends on other films, ideally classics.And yet this film failed me, because of reliance on two devices that really annoy. The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism. I gladly swallowed it in 'American Beauty,' more eagerly in 'Fight Club,' and reluctantly with 'Magnolia.' But here, it is so heavihanded only a teenager could not think it unsophisticated. And this in a film quoting Graham Greene!""
""'Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a paranoid schizophrenic anti-social teenager having therapy with Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross) and using medication. He has visions of a giant rabbit, Frank, the Fuzzy Bunny, who instructs him to make violent acts, like destroying the fire hydrant and piping to flood his high-school like in Graham Greene\'s book, which text was read in his English class, or burning to the ground the house of the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Donnie is not at home when an engine turbine falls of a plane into his bedroom without any explanation. He predicts the doomsday and is very interested in time travel through the wormhole.Donnie Darko is one of the weirdest cult movies ever. Richard Kelly follows the same school of David Lynch, making a very intriguing movie with the usual elements of this director, such as in The Lost Highway, using characters very bizarre and dark. The story is confusing and quite nonsense but holds the attention until the very end, with great cast and performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Donnie DarkoNote: On 16 November 2014, I saw this movie again.'""

""This is a Battle Royale situation where the rich hunt the poor but with the added twist that it speaks about polarized America, liberal elites against Sean Hannity rednecks. Given the template, we know we are not going to have to really know any of these people except as fodder in a game we watch. Stereotypes are mined often. The tone is gleeful, poking fun in passing rather than overtly serious, and I would rather have it this way. It's a light-hearted jab at a really broken historical moment.But as with other concept movies, after the raft of initial surprises of world are peeled off, I'm left with the same ordinary scenes of action, shootouts and fistfights. It trails off near the end, having nowhere left to go. The idea, spelled out for us at the end, is that the level of enmity and suspicion of the other runs so high, stories of how deplorable the other is give rise to the real thing. Both sides end up being kidnapped into the story.""

Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role.

""'This film very closely follows the plot of the original classic. An all American family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere (New Mexico desert here) and are attacked by a family ravaged by nuclear radiation.I\'m no fan of the first one. I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it\'s really happening can get to you. It didn\'t scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It\'s surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It\'s not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one.

This review contains spoilers.The I-Land is a Netflix produced show that premiered in 2019. The series is about a group of death row inmates that find themselves in a simulation to redeem themselves.The I-Land Season OneThe I-Land's first season is an overall disaster. This season has many problems that were apparent in the first episode. The series has almost all unlikable characters. The only likable character was Moses as he is actually able to be a good person in the simulation. Even his crime was involuntary manslaughter as he did not want to cause harm to people. This character was killed off in an awful way with Cooper accidentally shooting Moses. The actor for this character aws also enjoyable to watch as he made the series more light-hearted. The other characters in this series are awfully antagonistic. The I-Land inhabitants do not seem to want to get along or even discover the mystery of why they are in the I-Land.The first season fails in telling a cohesive story. There are many inconsistencies across the entire series. One of these is K.C. having a stab wound on her that is continued into the I-Land. Cooper has facial scarring that is not carried into the I-Land. This inconsistency is never explained in the series.I would not recommend 'The I-Land'. The series has so bad it is good moments but these are not enough to make the series watchable.Grade: D
'All series hold the audiance. Only the main carector stund and acting not suitable to ACP. Accent also not good that why i disappointed'

""'Pretty average - there is nothing new in the story. The story is jerky and there is no effort made to flesh out any character. The lead moves around in anger and arrogance without reason.

""'I am not the target audience for this series. Because of that, I am not going to give the show a score--just talk about it and what other \'oldsters\' like me might think of it.Over the Garden Wall is a cartoon movie that\'s been split into 10 segments. Because of this, you may just want to watch it all at once. The story is about a boy (probably about 12-13 years-old) named Wirt and his little brother, Gregory. The story is about their weird quest to find their way home from a strange and magical land--which is sort of like a dystopian version of Wonderland. It\'s all very dark and EXTREMELY confusing. In fact, what it\'s all about isn\'t even apparent until episodes 9 and 10! In the interim, you\'ll no doubt be very confused. I say it\'s best NOT to try to think about what you\'re watching--just watch and enjoy the occasional laughs.So is it worth seeing? Well, yes if you have a VERY high tolerance for the strange and confusing. If you demand that the show explain itself and be normal, then don\'t watch. The story, while convoluted and weird, is worth while by the end. The background animations are very nice and there are a few familiar voices such as Elijah Wood and Christopher Lloyd. The bottom line is that it is nice to see Cartoon Network trying something different--and it certainly is different.'""

""'Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance is a 2006 mini-series consisting of 10 episodes (5 minutes max, usually shorter) that was made to create a bridge between two seasons of the original series. It runs for roughly the length of a usual episode and features some of the main characters of the show. Thumbs up for that as it\'s not a given. Some shows (Walking Dead, I think) include random mini-series that do not feature any of the main players. The action includes the rise of new life, the death of old life and some moral questions about the connection between arms and holy places. Director Wayne Rose was assistant director on the original series and made a whole bunch of webisodes, also between other seasons. Writer Ronald D. Moore wrote a lot of these too, but also, even better, also some episodes of Battlestar Galactica.My favorite episode is the one where they are mourning for the blonde woman that died. All in all, however, I was not wowed enough so that I would feel a need to watch Battlestar Galactica anytime soon, maybe also because it is not really my genre. It\'s a good watch for huge fans of the show, but not a must-see by any means.'""
""'Defending Jacob, William Landay\'s 2012 based hit novel, is latest Apple TV series which is a slow crime drama. Thanks to the attempts to tell it over eight long episodes, the show feels slow and overstretched. As a result, dramatic tension and mystery elements are diluted, while the script needs more seasoning. Basically, there is a just few details that are explored and miniseries probably could have been just 90-120 minutes film. Ultimately, it is not the hit that Apple TV+ needs to be able to compete with major streaming services like Netflix.Rating: 6-/5+'""

"['Everything about the latest James Bond flick, ""Casino Royale,"" is big and first-rate. Humongous action sequences, glorious scenery, a tense plot, a to-die-for Bond, incredibly beautiful women, and villains beyond evil. Daniel Craig is Bond, and when you get a look at his body, watch out. Not to mention those turquoise eyes. He\'s a tough Bond with less of a sense of humor and less relaxed than some previous 007s, but he fits the 21st century very well.This ""Casino Royale"" is far superior to the 1967 episodic film which had huge problems including actors who refused to be in the same room with one another during scenes, different writers writing dialogue for the same scene that didn\'t match, things like that. This version is an actual story, with Bond going after a financier of terrorists, Le Chiffre, in order to take all the money in a poker game. Things don\'t work out as planned; Bond is nearly killed right at the poker table, among other situations. And the terrorists want the money being gambled away - enough to kill and torture for it.""That\'s quite a body count you\'ve been stacking up,"" M (Judi Dench) tells Bond. Indeed, he\'s taking people out right and left and acting like a renegade.Bond, with his loose sexuality and attitude toward women isn\'t exactly a modern hero. Here, with the excellent performance of Daniel Craig, he comes closer than he has in a while to being a Bond for this century.']",Unsupervise

The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors.

This is more like the tone of the original GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (and much better than the disappointing sequel), i.e. it manages to tell a good adventure story while being very funny and quirky at the same time.The expansive Thor mythology and backdrop has kicked up a gear, so that all of the characters return for a faster and funnier tale. I liked the idea of the prison planet ruled by a perfect Jeff Goldblum, and of course there's all the action you can hope for. However, the character beats are where this film really works: Chris Hemsworth has never been warmer, more human, or funnier, and Mark Ruffalo shines in a smaller role.

Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.

Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically? Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie.""The Social Network"" does come out really good.

The film delivers lots of epic grandeur; the at sea-scenes/battles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding. Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke.

"[""Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder.

It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head.

However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing.

"['I have always said that the James Bond franchise died after Sean Connery left. ""Casino Royale"" affirms that. Like every installment after Connery left, this one consists of overwrought gimmicks and a less than obvious story. Twenty minutes into the movie, we had already had enough of the action (that whole chase scene in Madagascar would have been cool with Jackie Chan, but it\'s boring with anyone else). True, there are a few hot babes to move things along, but they can\'t equal the quality set up by the first three movies. Daniel Craig did far better in ""Munich"".And another thing: why does it seem like so many people hate John Huston\'s 1967 version of ""Casino Royale""? True, that one was totally silly, but it wasn\'t pretending to be anything else.

Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That\'s another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into ""reality"".But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie.

A pulse pounding picture with energy and enthusiasm that is admittedly less cerebral and more visceral than the first film.The cartooned, somewhat clichÃ©d ""action figures"", that Ripley reluctantly joins are literally thrust into a meat grinder of a ""bug hunt"" and they all make the most of their training and fight the terror with bravado and courage.

The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish.

Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter\'s 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus ""The Thing"" (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott\'s ""Alien"" from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino\'s belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story\'s context, is welcomed), though the film\'s 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a ""Chapter Five"" prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark.

Broadbent and he bonded back in the day and that's why Dumbledore wants him back.The Half Blood Prince keeps up the high standard of film making that the Harry Potter series is known for.

"['In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not.

"[""Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before.""]",Unsupervise
"['Russell Crowe\'s stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely. No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured. Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his ""unsuitable"" private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.']",Unsupervise
"['""A Beautiful Mind"" is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I\'d say more, but I don\'t want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash\'s mental illness--something he\'s struggled with for many years.I enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"". It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it\'s SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man\'s life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn\'t particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe\'s accent. I don\'t know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.']",Unsupervise

It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails.

Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors.

The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.

In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy\'s father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ\'s blood while interring him. It\'s up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there\'s a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.']",Unsupervise
"[""I enjoyed this film. Eastwood is about as snarly as I've ever seen him. He has taken Archie Bunker to the next level. He terrorizes his neighbors, is hateful to his children, and incredibly intolerant of a changing world. With that said, this is a story about redemption. It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.lThe whole thing kind of slides off into predictability toward the end, but it's a good story and had to end some way, especially with Kowalski's self realizations and his rendezvous with death. The other thing is just watching a masterful actor take on this role and squeeze every last drop out of it.""]",Unsupervise

"[""A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch).""]",Unsupervise

This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn\'t need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn\'t establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It\'s unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It\'s brutal at times, with Lensherr\'s quest for revenge. This isn\'t really ""action"" as much as ""thriller"", and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I\'ve seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10']",Unsupervise

The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in ""The Passion of the Christ"", I have to wonder if any person\'s human body can stand up to that type of torture. It\'s too graphic even for words, and rending another person\'s flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it\'s horror, and in today\'s politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it\'s own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong\'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it\'s horrors.

Now he's trying to be legitimate again by starring and directing himself in a play based on a Raymond Carver story. Shot in what seems like one continuous take, this film is a compelling take on art vs. commerce, realism vs. simple playacting, and sanity vs. insanity. Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and others do fine performances on how some actors cope with whatever insecurities they have when things don't always happen like they think they should.

"[""I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.""]",Unsupervise

I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes.

However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.For me, the biggest problem from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichÃ©s, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the ""nerd"" archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film ""Revenge of the Nerds"".All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.I consider ""The Big Bang Theory "" to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be ""cool"" and ""edgy"" by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.So, in other words, ""The Big Bang Theory"" is the (stereotypically) nerd version of ""Friends"".']",Unsupervise

"[""Charlie Brooker is a great satirist: funny and clever, and, although often crude, in 'Black Mirror' he certainly isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator (in spite of the fact that the first film is about the prime minister having sex with a pig!). Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart.""]",Unsupervise

"[""Since the dawn of television, serialized series have been quite popular with audiences. It peaked when JR was shot nearly 40 years ago and has survived VHS, cable, and streaming and video games. 24 made it real innovative with its real time episodes set in an hour (with commercials). Then in 2004, ABC kicked off its hit season with Desperate Housewives and Lost. Created by the same guy who made Jennifer Garner a sex icon in Alias, Lost is about a crew of plane passengers that crash into an island trying to find their way home. LIke seinfeld, the series finale is not as good as other finales but concludes the most confusing tv storyline ever made. I remember watching part of the two hour season premiere which at the time was the most expensive TV pilot ever made until Game of Thrones broke that record. I had a crush on Evangeline Lilly before she became the wasp as well as other movie roles and the way it was shot and sounded like felt like a movie. Even the title is very twilight zoneish.

You could argue the show went on for too long, that the broadcaster milked it a little, but for me the show is at its strongest about half way through, series three sees the mystery and suspense cranked up, more questions asked and some good new characters. The final series is a little disappointing, I personally didn't like the conclusion, but I'm sure many fans do.Lost highlights the importance and art of storytelling, as a viewer you are tricked, confused and pushed into many blind alleys, trouble is when you start watching you can't switch off, it's always so engaging. The puzzles unravel slowly.Very well acted all round, I especially liked Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson, Ben is such an interesting character, he adds a lot to the series.I will always be a big fan of Lost, somehow it feels like a game changer.""]",Unsupervise

The park is maintained by robotic 'hosts', who aid the fulfilment of the guests desires. However, the many advances in technology that have taken place since the park opened have meant the hosts have become increasingly lifelike over the years.Now, they've reached a point where they are growing more and more self-aware and have a stronger grasp on reality, that reality being that they are simply there to carry out a function. After this long, it would appear that the hosts have had enough, and the ultimate rebellion starts to get underway.Westworld is that other kind of sci-fi, the type that is focused on using technology and the future world to explore who we are as people. The series is about what it means to be sentient. It's about the choices we make.

Thus, both the pre-ending and ending are rather trivial as well.True, Matthew McConaughey as Detective ""Rust"" Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective ""Marty"" Hart are splendid, there is a good chemistry between them regardless how they get along, but the rest are just good (perhaps due to non-elaborated characters), and there is no fitting antagonist present who could provide intensity and witty nuances to potential cat-and-mouse play.

Surprisingly though some may find the realism stretched somewhat I think it works for the most part.For those interested in the forensics the science comes across as interesting at least to a layman, much as it does in the original CSI series. The other strength of the show is relationship dynamics, the most important of which is between Dr Brennan and Agent Booth.

Bones is a low EQ high IQ forensic anthropologist who solves murder mysteries using the assumed power of science. The reality of forensics however is nowhere near as analytic as this show would have you believe. Its an imprecise art more than a science and as such its prone to error. The other limitation, with Bones, is it is inclined to be a bit corny and clinched, at times. This is exacerbated by the shows tendency to make rather shallow, moral judgments, that, like the shows forensics, simply don't stand up too well to scrutiny. Casting these shortcomings aside what makes Bones work for me is the interplay between the main characters. The cast of actors work well together and compliment one another.The relationships that develop between them also give this show a sense of family that is familiar and at times charming. Bones lack of emotional intelligence leads to some genuinely funny moments too. The episodic stories are innovative with enough interesting plot twists and turns to keep the viewers attention.

This, in addition to how the squints can pinpoint locations and facial recognition from some of the most far fetched ways detracts from what is basically a pretty good series.

Yet, even after 80+ episodes I find myself NOT tiring of the formula, thanks to the great chemistry between the leads, plus the likable gang of supporting characters - Hodgins, Sweets, etc. - and the continuing high production values and well thought out mysteries. Plus one of the greatly appealing aspects of the show - the idea that we are eavesdropping on people working at the very cutting edge of forensic technology - also has not gotten old. Nor has the will they, won't they nature of the relationship between the two principals. Normally one of these slow burn Remington Steele romances has a best before period of about three seasons, after which the viewer loses interest over things apparently not going anywhere.

"[""Last kingdom Is nowhere near big-budget productions like Vikings and other recent medieval shows. It lacks any artistic perspective and visuals to back it.

First episode is about a annoying boy who can't act at all, its laughable bad and the drama that follows is not very convincing. A few losers in the kingdom blabbering like old ladies while vikings knocking at their front door. And it gets worse. Its so boring and full of plotholes.

"[""THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie.""]",Unsupervise

Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.Most of the episodes have been directed by Robert Weide, who seems to be attuned to Mr. David\'s kind of comedy.

Larry David is always enjoyable playing himself, something that is no small accomplishment. He is just a natural. Cheryl Hinds plays Larry\'s wife with a lot of style. Jeff Garlin, as Larry\'s manager, is good.

When we watch it we usually watch 2 consecutive episodes, sort of like watching a movie.We just finished season 2 and now have started on season 3. The theme of the series is terrorist threats to the USA homeland after the attacks of 9-11. The main character is Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, CIA agent. Often brilliant, often inappropriate, a highly flawed individual who is always focused on her job, tracking down terrorists and foiling their plots. Sometimes she is successful, sometimes not.Her boss is Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, always a calming influence. In seasons 1 and 2 much of the focus is on British actor Damian Lewis doing a real good American accent as Marine Nicholas Brody, captured by terrorists abroad for 8 years, presumed dead by many including his wife and two children. When he returns as a Muslim the running question is whether he is legit or whether he has become a terrorist also, waiting for the opportunity to take out significant targets.Those 3 actors in those 3 characters make the series interesting. Especially the erratic behavior of Mathison. Danes really is one of the best female actors currently, anyone who missed her performance as Temple Grandin really should look it up.']",Unsupervise

The production values are good as is Charlie Sheen, the only actor to have any real life in his character, but that's it. The writing and jokes that were once creative are now stale and forced, even lacking in subtlety, while the story lines introduce good themes but don't introduce and explore them well and the stories themselves feel rushed and predictable. The characters are not very likable now, some actually are annoying and act like idiots. Now they've replaced Sheen, while I am overall not impressed with the show, I think regardless of his problems I think replacing him is a mistake, without him the show really is going to be a dead weight even with all the other faults it has.

Some people apparently don\'t realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I\'ve seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie\'s highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly\'s stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in ""Singin\' in the Rain"".Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.']",Unsupervise

Cobra Kai intrigues us with its great narrative. No more one dimensional 'Good vs Evil' story we've all been told a million times over. This reflects the feelings of the 'loser' of the memorable 1984 film Karate Kid and picks up 34 years later. Because of this narrative and spin I find Johnny to be an inspirational figure by trying his best to rebuild his life. Johnny is a very down to earth and simple character and is making the most of the hand dealt to him, isn't that how we live our lives?

"[""To compare this Star Trek series to any previous one is extremely difficult because this new show is very little like any of the previous shows. Now, instead of a one hour story that occasionally lasted several episodes, the show is essentially one long story...much like a soap opera or movie serial. Because of that, it's a tough show to watch here and there and it demands your attention each episode...something some viewers would no doubt not like. Additionally, the show is much darker and after the first half of season one, there is NOTHING that even remotely looks like comedy or even light drama. No, it's oppressive, dark and dim. On the positive side, it IS great looking...with effects that look as good as movies. But, Star Trek purists will no doubt be offended because this series is supposed to take place a decade before the first series from 1966-1969....yet the effects and technology seem hundreds of years ahead!

This episode sought to introduce the major characters who will appear regularly and even if, for the reasons stated above, the personnel and their back-stories lost me somewhat, the main story got through.With flashy, high-tech graphics, fine special effects, especially when Agent Coulson\'s car makes out like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the end and an easy to follow story, I was well- entertained in the fairly shallow way I expected. Sure some of the dialogue should have been screened extensively by the clichÃ©-cops and everyone\'s either being sarcastic or witty (they think), but there are some decent one-liners in there as you\'d hope.On the whole then, it\'s probably a bit too fast, flashy and loud for taste, but then again I\'m not much interested in comics from before 1980, so this was always gong to be a slightly awkward fit for me, but as trashy, disposable TV it\'s okay and I\'m confident that a major story-line will develop, as indeed I hope the rather large cast of characters do too.']",Unsupervise

Asking these actors doing these unnecessary love-making scenes was not kind to them, 'cause it's the on-going interviews of the extremely violent, vicious, twisted-minded serial killers and the gradual development of the profiling science of the FBI that interested us, not the licking, grinding, kissing love-making sexual scenes between the straight or the lesbian persons motivated us to watch this series.The 2nd season spent too much episodes on the Atlanta serial killing investigation, I was a bit getting tired of these episodes. I also sympathize the actors who in order to show how people chain-smoking in the 60s, 70s and 80s, they had to smoke so many cigarettes in every episode, hope them won't get lung cancers after this drama series.

"[""Clever, hilarious comedy.A behind-the-scenes look at the the cast and crew of The Girly Show (TGS), an NBC skit-comedy program. Centres on the executive producer of the show, Liz Lemmon (played by Tina Fey), her boss, GE/NBC executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).Created by Tina Fey, of SNL fame, 30 Rock is incredibly clever, especially in its references to topical events and in poking fun at the entertainment industry. Quite over-the-top at times, and delightfully so. The jokes come thick and fast, sometimes too fast - you've hardly digested one and the next one is upon you. If there is a negative, that is it - with the humour being so clever, you need some breathing space to sometimes get the jokes and being so snappy, you can easily miss things.Great performances and perfect casting. Alec Baldwin probably has the toughest gig, as his character is right-wing and capitalist to the extreme and is a living parody of not just the entertainment industry but business executives in general. Also, before this Baldwin was really considered only a drama-movie actor, so this is quite a change for him. He carries it off with aplomb.A classic and classy comedy series.""]",Unsupervise

I'm very impressed with Tiny Fey, she truly is very talented and I commend her for creating a show that is unashamed to be funny, intelligent and stupid all at the same time.Now that I am finally in the seventh season I think they made the right decision to go out on a high before the show had a chance to become too old and tired.

Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) juggles a busy producing career and the prospect of becoming a new mother, there\'s the fallout from Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter\'s divorce, and Todd (the always amazing Aaron Paul) somehow becomes CEO of a big corporation - before being superseded by his home-made sex robot Henry Fondle (whose pre-programmed phrases provides the answers that his employees want). In an often heavy show, Todd\'s levity and crazy hijinks provide vital balance as well as the clever sight gags that\'s become a tradition.The highlight of season five is \'Free Churro\'; it\'s a 25-minute monologue by BoJack at his mother\'s funeral. In these 25 minutes, BoJack\'s complex relationship with his mother unravels, from her final words to him and the random act of kindness to BoJack from a fast food employee. Watching one person talk for 25 minutes flies against the short attention span of most viewers, but it works and Arnett should get some sort of award for it.\nWhile season five continues to expose BoJack\'s many flaws (and constant self-loathing), it ends on an optimistic note, thanks to some help from Diane.A must-watch for BoJack fans.']",Unsupervise

The characters are well-rounded, various aspects of their galactic travel are explored, there is a wide range of continuing plotlines and costarring characters.  After a somewhat rocky start in the first half of the first season, as they hit all of the standard s.f. cliches (a character ages, they visit a parallel universe, they land on a planet where the female character must combat anti-feminism), they've broadened quite a bit, expanding the backstory of the Stargate itself, the enemy (the Gou'ald), and Earth's role to come.

Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn\'t Steven Spielberg\'s best movie by any stretch, but it\'s sure a neat one.

The conspiracy is pulled off well and the cast deliver some solid performances. Jon Bernthal was born for this role and pulls it off with ease. The only criticism is the one dimensional nature of the show with Frank and the rest of the cast. There is no irony, poetic justice and depth beyond the 'eye for an eye' story which could have taken it to new heights but this is that bit extra that I personally might have liked.

There were others, but not as important as these two.Now, Scorcese's projects in the past decade or so ranged between barely watchable (Gangs of New York) over mediocre flicks (Wolf of Wall Street) to exciting dramas (Shutter Island, The Departed) and even nice documentaries (George Harrison: Living in the Material World). Judging by this track record, Boardwalk Empire could have been anywhere between a disaster and a masterpiece.Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, has been the man behind Entourage, one of the lamest TV shows i've seen. But i didn't want to be judgmental and gave Boardwalk Empire a try.Probably the most important thing is to understand that Boardwalk Empire successfully interweaves facts with fiction. Looking at the storyline, each season kicked off rather uneventful and roughly after the first half the writers changed gears and headed toward the finale. The series is laced with violence and a fair amount of gore and female nudity.

It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, ChloÃ« Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece.""]",Unsupervise

It's one of an increasing number of shows from the States (and sadly, also from Britain, now) that you can actually watch and follow with the sound turned off. It's that simplistic. And it's just as well, because nothing is said that's worth hearing. Camera shots, facial expressions and body-language takes are so stereotypic and juvenile. Subtlety has no place in modern media. Every 'adult' has to behave like a large sexually-aware child. In fact this point is taken to such extreme that there simply are no old or even middle-aged people in Smallville. Everyone above the age of 30 has been deleted! Nor are there any children. Didin't anyone have parents or younger siblings? Doesn't anyone keep pets? Because I've yet to see a cat or a dog. Perhaps the makers spent too much time watching 'Logan's Run'. And of course; every female has a pert and well figured body, whilst every man has exemplary pects and a six-pack.

And that would not enhance the box office performance. But for home audiences, who cares if you have tons of brutality, that, on the contrary, enlarge, increase, the audiences and assure the show to continue beyond the first season?

Oddly I'd be more inclined to compare it to Vikings than to say, Penny Dreadful or The Frankenstein Chronicles, despite a difference in periods. Tom Hardy is perfect and highly charismatic.

The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population.

These stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.Netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'Stranger Things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. Love, Death & Robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. I'd say that my favorites would have to be 'Alternate Histories', 'Good Hunting', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'The Witness'. To be fair though, ALL the episodes are pretty good. They each cover their own respective genres just nicely.If you want to check out Love, Death & Robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto.

In truth, it could be anywhere. The mood is dark and psychological forces are at war. The town where this movie takes place could be anywhere and yet it seems like a place we all know because it exposes the secrets, the paranoia, the fears of being caught amid the casual friendships and veneer that we call everyday life. Dark music accompanies the progress of the show as we see one person after another cringe with fear as to where the next blow will land. Yet, we also see how human nature can rebound and lost souls can rally together and forge unity when crime pulls people apart. David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker, and Andrew Buchan are outstanding in this series. There are no heroes, only victims. If you want escapist entertainment, don't watch this.

The irony is that he may be better suited than the two major candidates now running for the Presidency in the real world.Though conflicts and crises often unite people, the situation on ""Designated Survivor""--being focused on Washington D.C.--quickly devolves into political gamesmanship, unprincipled and illegal, though totally believable.The acting on this show is excellent.

Instead of clever puns or gags they decided to just use gross-out humor which if done right can be funny but now it\'s just overkill. Most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional now.

"[""Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichÃ©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.""]",Unsupervise

Lots of acclaimed actors, intertwining characters and events, and twisted twists make such series interesting to follow - but, for the sake of full comprehension, you should have time and opportunity to watch all episodes in succession. All this applies to the series in question, where the cast is evenly strong (well, Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan and Liev Schreiber as Raymond ""Ray"" Donovan stick out still), and the situations and relations get complicated a lot, without becoming airy-fairy, and the nature of Ray\'s duties and his big family enable to deal with dozens of different mini-scenes. Perhaps too much for some, but I personally liked to follow what happened in different places at the same time.

Things don\'t work out as planned; Bond is nearly killed right at the poker table, among other situations. And the terrorists want the money being gambled away - enough to kill and torture for it.That\'s quite a body count you\'ve been stacking up, M (Judi Dench) tells Bond. Indeed, he\'s taking people out right and left and acting like a renegade.Bond, with his loose sexuality and attitude toward women isn\'t exactly a modern hero.

It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous.

This is more like the tone of the original GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (and much better than the disappointing sequel), i.e. it manages to tell a good adventure story while being very funny and quirky at the same time.The expansive Thor mythology and backdrop has kicked up a gear, so that all of the characters return for a faster and funnier tale. I liked the idea of the prison planet ruled by a perfect Jeff Goldblum, and of course there's all the action you can hope for. However, the character beats are where this film really works: Chris Hemsworth has never been warmer, more human, or funnier, and Mark Ruffalo shines in a smaller role.

""Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.

Grim yes, but not as grim as some of the experiences that Deckard has throughout the movie. Ridley Scott gives the movie a setting as grim as the one in Alien.

Even so, I\'ve been enthralled by the picture every time I\'ve seen it.Thinking about it today as I write this, we\'re only five years away from Ridley Scott\'s original vision set in Los Angeles of 2019. Robot technology seems to be in the news just about every day now, though nothing remotely approaches the wizardry of replicants, but who knows how far things will go. It\'s going to get pretty interesting.As for the picture, after each viewing it takes a few more days for it to completely leave my thoughts.

""'maybe, not the best movie about Shoah. but the most useful. because it reminds the small details who are bricks of normality. and it does that in a wise manner. far to be one of fans of film, it seems be a real high good job. but it presents , in beautiful manner, a side of tragedy. a not large part of a phenomenon who shows its fruits but not its deep roots. a duty of Spielberg to his people, a remarkable photography and a touching story, it is a must see not for the story, artistic virtues, memorable scenes, splendid performances but for not ignore the evil. because it is not a film about Jews or a courageous man who saves innocent people , not about war but about the science to be yourself in dark periods. a film who must see. for reflection. for not ignore. the past. the vulnerability of society face to evil.'""
""To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.\nIts not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be.""
""SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter.

The creative balance of action, effects, and imagination is lost. The three main actors (Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss) are upstaged by exciting new allies.

Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed.""
""'When you look at the reviews for Arrival on IMDB, you might notice that there is a huge disparity among them. Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films.

But, no matter if you like them or not, there\'s no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn\'t exactly a spoiler!) are amazing.

I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me.

""I saw the very first Spider Man entry with Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and whilst I enjoyed it I wasn't so enamored to watch any others until this current release which attracted excellent reviews. From minute one it was obvious that a lot had gone on in those other Spider Mans because it was barely the same Peter Parker/Spider-Man I met all those years ago. For one thing a lot is made of an outfit called The Avengers, which seems to be a group of superheroes bent on saving the planet and of which Spider-Man is a member. Then he has a 'mentor' in the shape of Robert Downey jnr, a 'special' friend best described as a nerd and has a crush on a Black schoolmate, so much for the Kirsten Dunst character. It seems evident that the last two or three Spider-Man movies are not so much stand-alones as sequential so I can only comment on this entry as something I only partly 'got'. Having said that it was reasonably entertaining if not (to me) as compelling as the original.""
""With this entry, Spider-Man is once again rebooted. No origin story this time which is as well since anyone knows how he came to be if they read the comics or at least Wikipedia. Tom Holland is suitably youngish being the high school student Peter Parker originally was and remained for a while during his creation. Nice splashes of humor throughout during even some of the more serious scenes. Awesome seeing Michael Keaton-former Batman portrayer-playing a main villain this time in a superhero movie. Oh, and yes, Stan Lee makes another of his cameos in a MCU movie! Also, there's a scene after the main closing credits and another one after the final end of them. In summary, Spider-Man: Homecoming is worth it to watch for die-hard fans!""
""GET OUT is a well-regarded modern-day American horror film that looks at race relations in an outlandish way.

In terms of the story, I found it quite predictable, and it does seem to drag out the mystery endlessly at the outset when it's quite obvious what's going on.

There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends. As in most modern movies, the trailer gives away the movie. I feel that the twist would be more compelling otherwise. It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.***** spoilers *****The brain transplanting is problematic for me. Obviously, the flash brings back the hosts' minds but their brains are presumably scoped out. It makes no sense that they can come back from that.

I know there were plans for a 'Spiderman 4' with the same cast, but it does feel at times like the director is trying to tie up all the loose ends.Maguire and Dunst do well in their roles as ever, and what's nice is that various people who have appeared across the series return.It's a decent film, albeit one that like many sequels before it is trying to do far too much.""

""I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline.""

The result is incoherent, simply jelly to stick some episodes together.\nSome of these are tolerable -- any of the scenes with Diane Venora or Jon Voigt. Venora knows how to be outside and inside at the same time. Everything else is TeeVee hash.That's because Pacino and DeNiro have just given up trying.

What transpires is Ralph Fiennes\' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth.

And, like Anderson\'s other films, it\'s full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing.

Yet, believe it or not, the film is humorous.Bradley Cooper steals the show as Phil, the California teacher, who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist, the zany groom's intended brother-in-law and our intended groom, the latter who has gone missing through most of the film.It's rare that a zany comedy works now, but this film actually does.""

Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn\'t been that good in a movie since Doc H. in Tombstone and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can\'t say I don\'t enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie.

The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism.

But I think it was simply a matter of not having a creative team in place that cared to make a good movie.There was only one cool effect: the seven Pegasii. And there was only one interesting character, Moaning Myrtle. Just one. So on the superficial level, the comment is that the basic film-making skills were absent.But wait! This is the guy behind Pushing Tin and Enchanted April, both supremely well done.So it must have been the producers that made this bloodless, a walk through the required scenes.So very strange, because the last one was all about rich film-making, It had a center, following the Orson Welles tradition that anchored the thing in the buildings.

Fortunately, it is a great film, ending the series on a high note. The pacing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fast, meaning action happens almost non-stop. Watching Harry Potter and the other wizards in Hogwarts in dire danger from Voldemont is very engaging. The special effects are very smooth and realistic, and one can only be marvelled by the complexity of the special effects in the battle scene. The only complaint I have is the underwhelming 3D effects. In most scene the 3D is barely noticeable, and there is only one scene involving fragments scattering in the sky that the 3D is spectacular.

At nearly three hours it was ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.This is all said, there was a momentum that kept it going. There were some new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it marginally likable.By the third, however, it was a tired formula. From then on it was all about gouging more money from kids and nerds.Rating for this last one should be lower, but it gets a bonus point for finally ending this seemingly-never-ending, sequels-for-the-sake-of-more-money series.""
""'high technology. imaginative director. tasteful cocktail of myths, ecology and defense of basic values of human kind. against every critic, it is an amazing show. seductive, touching, maybe not profound but convincing. it is easy to blame it and it is easy to proclaim it as masterpiece. if you ignore its purpose. because the film has the admirable virtue to propose new measure unit in cinematography. than - to give the best image to a lot of problems of every day news. not the least, to give a challenge. to public, critics and cultural media . and that fact is the only important. because, fan or enemy of Cameron vision, it remains not easy to ignore. because it represents a new mythology, inspired mixture of elements from Sci Fi and old fairy tales.the only problem - maybe Sam Wortihington. but, in few decades, each error becomes a virtue.'""
""'This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don\'t like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God\'s sake. This is full of spectacle, humanity, and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I\'m surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren\'t complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren\'t as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.'""
""When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5.""

It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved. There is not much light in this, but there doesn't need to be - it's perfect just the way it is (or is it?)""

I think I just wasn't prepared for how raunchy it was... well that and it wasn't all that funny. Part two is definitely as raunchy, but 1.) It isn't as sex heavy. I didn't watch Deadpool for frequent sex scenes or sex references.\n2.) It is funnier. They added some more visual humor which had me laughing-out-loud a lot more than the Ryan Reynolds' quips. \n3.) It has better action. By adding some other super powered characters we go to see some better action. \n4.) The story is so much better. Deadpool finds himself having to be selfless to save someone and it's not the bland save-the-girlfriend bit.I truly enjoyed this movie and I like the direction Deadpool is moving. It is trending upward.""
""'Opening plot spoiler is they kill off Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) before the credits so we lose the banter that worked so well in the first film. Her death weighed heavy into the plot themes as the plot lacked. Don\'t feel too bad, because in X-Men, time travel is possible and they can bring her back in any episode. The film includes numerous pop culture references and asides as if to critique itself. In one scene Deadpool signs an autograph as Ryan Reynolds and if anything they may have used this type of humor too often. Julian Dennison, who we loved as the orphan in Hunt for the Wilderpeople continues as the disagreeable orphan. Zazie Beetz takes over for Morena Baccarin in the off beat comedy role. Her super power is luck. Brad Pitt is listed as The Vanisher in the credits, but was never seen and I don\'t recall any lines. Matt Damon also in a cameo. Guide: Heavy swearing. Butt nudity.'""
""DEADPOOL 2 is the sequel to the surprisingly funny superhero spoof starring Ryan Reynolds. Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed. The X-Men parallels are fun and the plot keeps you guessing, with a string of quirky supporting characters proving a match for our hero. Hardly a ground-breaking movie, but it does entertain and that's what matters.""
Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) has to deal with a teen mutant called Firefist (Julian Dennison) who has anger issues. Then Cable (Josh Brolin) comes from the future. It seems Firefist as an adult killed his wife and kid and wants to kill him before he grows up.\nSequel to the wildly successful original. However it's not as good. A LOT of the jokes are carried over from the original and they aren't funnier the second time around. Also at almost two hours it's too long. On the plus side the acting is good and Brolin clearly enjoys playing Cable. Lots of action and violence too. So--it's up to you if you want to see it.
""LAPD officer K(Gosling, cynical on the surface) investigates an unusual case. No, sorry, that's all you're getting for plot. If you see someone getting into a lot of detail, avert your eyes. Go into this as blind as Niander(Leto, driven by his cause). Thank me later.This is 2 hours and 33 minutes long, which is not excessive considering how it uses its time. The pacing allows some scenes to go on for a while, however, it's always appropriate. Major props to whoever thought Denis Villeneuve would be right for this. He couldn't be more perfectly chosen. His use of symbolism, exploration of philosophy and compelling themes fit as a companion to the film Ridley Scott created, without merely redoing it(the hints are neat, if perhaps a tad too numerous). This expands upon the issues about Replicants in truly inspired ways(albeit I acknowledge that not all of them were thought up purely for this movie). The acting is sublime. If Joi(Armas, expressing so much with so much forced restraint, for reasons I won't reveal) doesn't break your heart, get an EKG stat, it's stopped beating already. This is not driven by action, rather, the gripping mystery.There is some bloody, even brutal, violence, nudity and disturbing material in this, used well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys speculative sci-fi. 10/10""
""'Baz Luhrmann and The Great Gatsby sounds real eccentric. And this adaptation is the proof. I admitt, for me, Robert Redford remains the only Jay Gatsby. And the spectacular recreation of 1920 decade, the flavor of period, the luxury mixed with heavy kitsch are far to be surprising from this kind of director. But the film has two good pillars, more than interesting - Carrey Mulligan as Daisy and fascinating Wolfsheim by the great Amitabh Bachchan . And, not the last, the shining di Caprio, more portrait from an old Hollyiwood poster than the expected Gatsby. Another good point remains the tragic romanticism use. And the nice Nick Carraway of Tobey Maguire. Short, a glamorous film. Seductive, mpressive, moving. Not the best but real, real good. For details, performances and its admirable director.'""
""Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recalls his time with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's 1922 on Long Island. Nick rents a small house next to Jay's mansion. He is constantly throwing big parties. Nick is visited by his cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).Baz Luhrmann definitely injects his vision of the roaring 20s. The music is perfect. The movie has the grandiose vision that it so desperately needs. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for this role. In many ways, he brings his real life and breathes it into this character. His real life models-filled-partying ways make it so realistic. Carey Mulligan brings a more sweet sensibility. However Tobey Maguire and his non-stop literary narration isn't always needed. Unlike the visuals, more is not always the best. What is truly needed is a solid lens for the audience to view the proceedings. Tobey is more a shaky cam. The last 1/3 is too slow. It needs a more tension filled resolution. All in all, it's beautiful and Leo's perfect.""

However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as \'Facebook\' with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks.Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin. The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg. Fincher\'s directions infuse the movie with energy. And Garfield creates humanity in his character. This Zuckerberg is a stand-offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority. It is an unique character and an unique film.'""
""It is really hard to find something bad to say about this brilliant movie. David Fincher directs Aaron Sorkin's screenplay about the skyrocket status of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg)to Internet superstar. Of course when things are accomplished resulting in more money than anyone really needs; friends can easily become enemies. Zuckerberg juggles business relationships with co-founder and money man Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield)and Napster founder Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake). This Harvard undergrad and computer programing wiz just wanted to find female friendship and ended up creating a social network that would eventually end up putting more than a million people in touch with like minded others half way around the world. The ownership of Facebook would end up in question when the Winklevoss twins(Armie Hammer and Josh Pence)put up a bitter courtroom fight for control of the network claiming the young entrepreneur stole their original idea while building it for them. This biographic chronicle deserves every bit of the kudos from the Golden Globes and Oscars. And it seems to employ the cast of millions...well you know what we mean. Garnering screen time are the likes of: Rooney Mara, Joseph Mazzello, Brenda Song, Malese Jow, Bryan Barter, Patrick Mapel, Jayk Gallagher, Mariah Bonner and even writer Sorkin. Interesting way to spend a couple of hours that seem to fly by.""
""'First, I should admit that I can\'t verify the accuracy of The Social Network. Nonetheless, David Fincher\'s look at Facebook\'s origins is a very engrossing movie. Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically? Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie.The Social Network does come out really good. The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about. Of course, people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook.Definitely worth seeing.'""

'I was very disappointed with this Oscar-nominated film of 2010. It basically has many of the antics of the old college films. The only difference here is the intellectual connotation due to the rise of the facebook technological theme.Jesse Eisenberg is definitely credible as facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The film deals with the suit filed by others against Zuckerberg and his chums for allegedly stealing the facebook idea for himself.There are the many foolish college life scenes still depicted in the film.The film starts with Eisenberg talking a mile a minute on a date. It is only when he meets up with the Justin Timberlake character that he becoming a maneuvering character. The film shows some accurate traditional problems of corporate management. The problem of Eduardo is dealt with in the way you generally expect such problems to be handled.The film is not even in the class of this year\'s superb The King\'s Speech.'
""Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie. Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.Disappointing, but entertaining enough.""

However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My review doesn\'t really say anything about the story itself.

The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best.

""Spirited Away, the latest film from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki (a genius to Disney animators, such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US), is a wonderful family film, that works on numerous levels for kids, not the least being the creative storyline, and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of, well, an anime movie. The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion (perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination. Even those strident fans of maturer (err extra violent) anime pictures will want to look, maybe more than once. Works on many levels and I recommend it of course, if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke. Grade: A (or 9.5/10)""
""Now then, where do we start? On the plus side, this is one of the more intelligent applications of CGI in an historical drama setting. The film delivers lots of epic grandeur; the at sea-scenes/battles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding. Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke. This is undoubtedly a story that could have made Cecil B De Mille proud, instead I suspect he's have nodded off...""

""Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche.""
""Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind.""
""'Launched in 1999 and one of the most successful movies of the year, Matrix is an amazing movie. It ranks among the movies that leave the spectator bemused, even after several projections.In a way, it\'s very similar to Paul Verhoeven\'s movie Total Recall (1990). The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay, astounding special effects and especially, a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie, he\'s introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life. But an unexpected event will transform his life and make him a hero.Matrix is also a very well stable movie that you can divide in two parts: the first one mainly focuses on long dialogs sequences that incline to reflection while the second one honors stunning action sequences.A remarkable performance crowns it all and Keanu Reeves finds here his best role to date. The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this, maybe to give their movie, a Hollywood nature.An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties.'""

He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10""
""EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it.""
""'What makes us human? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he\'s a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially bro Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It\'s really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren\'t there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn\'t he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain\'t. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it'""
""The franchise continues in the second movie in the series. There is a good step upwards in the quality of FX, CGI, and sets. We get introduced to Dobby, the house elf. He's a good CGI character. More importantly, he's a likable character which is so different from a certain Star Wars character who shall not be named. It's a big relief that Dobby is a good success.If there is something missing, it's a darker and scarier Chamber of Secrets. With so much built up, the final section should be a more thrilling and scary ride. It's like a horror movie that doesn't deliver in the end. I think Chris Columbus has reached his limits. It's just not in him to deliver the mood, the thrills, or the scary moments.""
""This is still a favorite of ours for 20+ years now, our most recent viewing was last night on my DVD copy of the movie. We have probably watched it 5 or 6 times over the years.This of course won the Oscar for Damon's and Affleck's script, which itself originated from a paper Damon wrote while in college. Quite an unlikely development for two 20-something friends but in watching the movie yet again I am struck with how well several meaningful themes are woven in the script.The main theme is Damon's character, Will Hunting, who has a brilliant mind but as an orphan was abused in his foster home, resulting in his building a mostly impenetrable shell around himself. Some of the best scenes are with him and his psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams.And Ben Affleck, Damon's best friend in real life, is Will's best friend Chuckie who doesn't have a brilliant mind and accepts that he will be a laborer all his life. He would feel insulted if Will ended up wasting his gift.All this comes to a head when Will meets Skyler who will soon be graduating from college and heading out west for medical school. She and Will fall in love but Will is scared to commit himself to a relationship. In the end he has to decide if he will just stay in Boston.""

""Well,finally Leonardo DiCaprio wins an Oscar.He felt that he should have been nominated for his earlier movie Titanic but never mind.At least,now he can finally be proud of the The Revenant for it wasn't only a nomination that he got but a trophy itself for an Academy Award for Best Actor.This film by Alejandro G. IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu is based from the novel of Michael Punke's novel of the same title.It stars DiCaprio together with Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.It tells the story of frontiersman Hugh Glass particularly his experiences in 1823.During an expedition in an uncharted American territory,legendary explorer Hugh Glass is brutally attacked by a bear and has been left for dead by the member of his frontier.But showing sheer determination and strong will to survive,Glass tries his best to live out the unimaginable circumstances that has left him to join his family back. He tries to navigate through a cruel winter and harsh realities that has left him behind.No question that this is a great film.It showcases the triumph of the human spirit and the extraordinary power of a person to survive amid abominable circumstances.Anybody who are facing trials and challenges in this world will definitely find it worth-watching and truly enjoyable.They would be inspired by it.""
""Either too much or not enough can be said about THE REVENANT. Leonardo DiCaprio most definitely earned his Oscar; the movie was robbed of being Best Picture.This snowy thriller is set in the early 1820's and follows the trials and tribulations of a fur trapper, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), as he relentlessly seeks retribution against the fur trapping companions who left him for dead near the icy Missouri River after being mauled by a bear. Plus there will be hell to pay for one trapper, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who murdered Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).Exceptionally filmed, except sometimes the wilderness doesn't seem too remote. But still a beautiful movie to look at. Character development was well done and did not set a problem of who any villain might be. It was a little strange listening to 1800's trappers using modern slang. The sequence of the bear attack was hard to watch brutal. My other favorite scene is the climactic ruthless fight.I believe this will be one of those movies one will want to watch again and again. It is already in my plans.A very hard working cast that also features: Domhnall Gleeson, Fabrice Adde, Will Poulter, Duane Howard, Melaw Nakehk'o, Arthur Redcloud, Paul Anderson, Christopher Rosamond and Grace Dove.""
""'There aren\'t many moments in the movie that aren\'t intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I\'m not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in The Passion of the Christ and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One\'s attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man\'s perseverance, exemplified by Glass\'s own words in my summary line above.'""
""LOGAN (2017) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Richard E. Grant, Eriq La Salle, Elis Neal, Quincy Fouse.

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work perfectly together. The stern almost emotionless Tommy (aka K) and the energetic J, who\'s all over the place. That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the aliens that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them.

There`s no tightly plotted story , instead we`re treated to a script that seems to have been written to show off some special effects to the pop corn munching audience which is a pity because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do make a very good double act , the humour hits the right spot ( Sly Stallone is an alien ! ) and the effects are actually quite good - It`s just a pity the plot is vague and meandering'""

It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.""

About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing.

""'I have always said that the James Bond franchise died after Sean Connery left. Casino Royale affirms that. Like every installment after Connery left, this one consists of overwrought gimmicks and a less than obvious story. Twenty minutes into the movie, we had already had enough of the action (that whole chase scene in Madagascar would have been cool with Jackie Chan, but it\'s boring with anyone else). True, there are a few hot babes to move things along, but they can\'t equal the quality set up by the first three movies. Daniel Craig did far better in Munich.And another thing: why does it seem like so many people hate John Huston\'s 1967 version of Casino Royale? True, that one was totally silly, but it wasn\'t pretending to be anything else. And besides, how can you not admire a cast of David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress (hubba hubba!)? My point is that this version is not worth your while. I recommend avoiding it.'""
""'After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.'""

The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot.'""
""'At this point, The Avengers has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it\'s obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn\'t take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn\'t quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn\'t quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it\'s just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in The Avengers. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren\'t fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...'""
Based on fact movie but the war at Dunkirk. British and French soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk waiting to take a ship back to England. However the Germans are doing a non-stop bombing of Dunkirk beach (where the soldiers are) and the ships coming to save them.Visually this is an impressive movie. The visuals are stunning (especially in IMAX) and the battle sequences are beautifully shot. However there's no emotional involvement with the main characters. You know their names--and that's about it. It's really hard to give a damn if you know nothing about them. I suppose the acting was good but--since they're given nothing to work with--I really couldn't tell.So visually it's impressive but emotionally cold. Try to see it in IMAX.
""'Dunkirk is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Dunkirk'""
""One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right.""

""'300 Once again, not having high expectations turned a movie into a pleasant surprise. Oh, this isn\'t anything super, but it is a lot better than I had heard. Yeah, I heard the usual it\'s just moronic mayhem, nothing but blood and guts and way overdone action. Not really. I\'ve seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here. When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn\'t go on and on. It lasted a few minutes at most and broke for a lull.The only aspect I thought was sub-par was some of the dialog, which sounded juvenile in spots. That and, at least for me, I found myself unable to get involved with any of the characters. Oh, I definitely did not want the bad guy to win but I didn\'t think the good guy was anything appealing, either.What WAS appealing were the colors in here and the special-effects. What a tremendous visual movie this is, just stunning in parts and interesting to look at from start-to-finish. That\'s what held my attention.

I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema.

""'One of Orson Welles last film roles was The Transformers Movie, an animated film in 1986. It was regarded as a low point to go out on. However in the cinematic world the name Transformers have been transformed thanks to Michael Bay kick starting the franchise and the original is the best so far.Direction wise this has all the Bay trademarks, swirling photography, stirring music and pumping action scenes with state of the art CGI. There is even some sly digs at the all powerful government agencies abusing the extent of their powers.The plot is straightforward. Shia Labeouf is a nerd who buys a car that transforms to a robot, his grandfather once made a discovery and now two gangs of robots are beating the hell out of each other. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are the good guys. The bad guys are the Decepticons and they are after the cube of power called the All Spark.

Even nearly forty years after discovering it, I am still amazed, which is not the case for many movies from the eighties, films that I discovered in my early adult life and that don\'t belong to my childhood - another life for me, as many people. When you are a child, movies are not seen the same way as when you find them when you are an adult. So back to this one, everything has already been said, I just wanted to point out the serial tribute. And I discovered forties serial from Republic pictures when I was thirty years old, already a adult.'""
""I can't say I've ever really got into this whole MCU thing, but this as a stand alone film was enjoyable enough.""
""During World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 90lb weakling who keeps getting rejected for military services. Then Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and recruits him for his secret scientific program where he encounters Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Rogers undergoes an experiment that makes him a new super soldier. Meanwhile the Nazis have invest heavily in a secret weapons research agency called HYDRA. Only the head of HYDRA Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) has bigger goals and his own ambitions.I really like the skinny Chris Evans even thought it's odd to hear his voice coming out. He and Hayley Atwell have good chemistry before and after the transformation. Their relationship is better than the usual comic book movie. As far as the action goes, it's all very CGI. That's not unexpected. However the cartoon nature and the overuse of montages really takes away much of the tension. After a good first half, the second half gets into a rambling flow of jagged story telling. Even the climax lacks the needed excitement. This ends more as a setup for future sequels.""
""This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.

""'This film tells the story of a young man who is not physically fit enough to be in the Army. He is selected for a special program to transform him into a superhero that will save the United States of America.Captain America The First Avenger is quite unlike other superhero blockbusters. It starts off slow, detailing how he was bullied on the streets of Brooklyn and then in the Army training base. He is finally transformed into a superhero after one hour of screen time, which is pretty long and slow if you ask me. Then, the plot is rather unfocused, as it tells the fight between USA and Nazi Germany, and also the fight between Rogers and the bad red guy. I find the plot so unfocused that I lost interest in it altogether. It is not packed with action enough, not packed with enough thrills or excitement. Though I am a little disappointed, I think I will still watch the sequel to see if it gets any better.'""
""Quirky describes both Jim Carey and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. Michael Gondry directs this exercise in futile love and heartbreak. Joel(Carey)and Clementine(Kate Winslet)are a couple who's relationship has ran its course. Experimental technology allows Clementine to have any and all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Joel reluctantly decides to do the same, but in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind and struggles to keep those memories he wishes to cherish. This romantic Sci-Fi is clever, humorous, heartbreaking and very entertaining. Rounding out the cast: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. The story is a definite head spinner. I was most impressed with Winslet and her various hair colors...tangerine being my favorite. And if nothing else; how can a movie with Dunst dancing in her panties be bad? A decent soundtrack keeps the flick changing gears. Listen for ELO, Beck and The Willowz.""
""'Director Michel Gondry, whose specialty in music videos was a seamless visual blending of reality and surreality, was the perfect filmmaker for this thoughtful, provoking drama which juggles past and present. Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them. Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman\'s script aren\'t especially likable (particularly Winslet\'s argumentative love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted (and, purposely one assumes, splintered); despite some missteps, Gondry works nimbly steering the viewer through the mechanisms of the narrative, and there several engaging or arresting sequences. Similar in tone and spirit to Being John Malkovich, which Kaufman also wrote, and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****'""
""Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film.""
""'Director Sam Raimi brings back the Marvel comic book hero, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is still coming to terms with his dual identity. He\'s now going to college, delivering pizza and taking photos of...Spider-Man in order to pay his bills. His world is tumbling down around him; he\'s having trouble at college, his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco)is strained, his Aunt May(Rosemary Harris)is being pressured by the bank, and most of all wrestles with the thought of telling Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst)of his secret identity. The web-slinging Spider-Man has recently been bashed in the press; but NYC needs their hero for the city is threatened by Dr. Octo Octavius(Alfred Monlina)who has turned himself into Doc Ock, a multiple metal armed villain.CGI perfection. Danny Elfman\'s score meets his genius standards. The story is actually good for an action flick. I could do without the Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head sequence, but I realize it is needed to show how the weight of the world has been lifted from Parker as he temporarily tries to disown his work as Spider-Man. The pizza delivery is pretty cool; and the train fight is pulse pounding. Of course, the close-ups of Dunst also do something for me.Also in the cast are:J.K. Simmons, Daniel Gillies and the hot Venessa Ferlito. And for continuity there are the cameos of Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson. Spider-Man 2 should please children of all ages... from six to ninety-six.'""
""'Let me say I have generally enjoyed watching both Spider-Man films. They\'re fun to view, but as someone older who doesn\'t necessarily get thrilled watching teen romances, they aren\'t DVDs I would purchase. The action scenes, with Spider-Man flying around from skyscraper- to-skyscraper, are fantastic. I also loved the villain in here, the octopus-like Dr. Octavius, played just great by Alfred Molina.However, there is just too much Kirsten Dunst Mary Jane Watson) in here and the romance angles between her and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) are just annoying....too sappy, and they take away from the story too much. A little of it is fine, but that aspect of the story takes up too high a percentage of screen time.I\'ve read the comics and those concentrate mainly on Spider Man vs. various villains. I wish the movies would have done the same.'""
""'As improbable as the story is, it had a certain resonance to my mind about the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and make the best of one\'s circumstances under the most intolerable of conditions. Faced with the same situation, how many would simply give up and let fate take it\'s course? The harder thing to do is stretch one\'s mind and resources in an effort to stay alive and operate from a position of informed intelligence until help arrives. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) proclaims I\'m not gonna die here, not only do you believe it but you wish there was something you could do to help.That\'s not to say I didn\'t find some elements to be just too unbelievable. The real time communication with the rescue team, and especially the sharing of Watney\'s comments with the rest of the world defied any sort of credibility. China helping pro-actively - I don\'t think so, at least not in an official capacity. The cracking wise dialog of the crew members was also a little too forced it seemed. You would think there would be some consternation over the plight of the stranded team member.But for a sci-fi film offering a once in a lifetime what if scenario, the picture works well enough to be an entertaining diversion. I can think of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.'""
""The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack.""
""'This was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. The script is really dreadful and the premiss that an Amazonian daughter of Zeus heads into the 20th century to help the Brits during the First World War is as far fetched as it goes. That said, there is some chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and David Thewlis is quite menacing at times as Sir Patrick/Ares. The CGI isn\'t too oppressive and the (frequent) fight scenes though lengthy, are quite well staged. It\'s all just a bit of fun - quite comedic at times - and fine to watch on that basis.'""
""'This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.Wonder Woman is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that\'s just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.'""
""'Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We\'re talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I\'d see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a thrill park ride. Now that doesn\'t mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don\'t compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is!

""'I won\'t begin to describe the situation, you have a synopsis for that. I want to focus on the experience itself.First, the film has the look and feel of a graphic novel. This should please fans of the book even if the film strays, or has to condense a lot of back story in a small time, as it appeared to do in the opening sequence.The visual effects were stunning, and the music and sound track were superb.

""'Murder and absolute mayhem evolve around an organization dedicated to keep the peace. You know there is something inherently wrong with the writing of this film when possible annihilation between Russia and the United States in a nuclear war serves as a backdrop to what is really going on in this ridiculous film where the characters are dressed up as if they are comic book characters. All sorts of masks and disfigurement disguises are worn.This is basically a story of internal fighting within the organization and there is constant physical battling. We have one character, a physicist, maimed in an accident of long ago who is accused of making sure his cohorts develop malignancies. Another is set up to be imprisoned.We hear the familiar lunatic idea of making a new perfect world by killing millions of innocent people.'""
""'Well many would strongly disagree. But this is not about the quality of this sequel (some even suggesting this being superior than the first movie, that\'s not my decision to make), it is about one of the characters spewing many memorable quote. Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That\'s another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into reality.But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie. Effects are great, cast is amazing, some communication devices have dated though. Also a nice spin on the android-phobia from the first movie throughout the movie. Really well thought out and well made, one of the best sequels to an arguable classic'""
""'This sequel to Alien (1979) is a different type of movie. It\'s template is the same but the delivery and execution is quite different.Comparisons are inevitable but should be done as a reference point rather than an intolerable insight into its method of madness. Aliens is an Action film in a Sci-Fi setting with Horror elements. A pulse pounding picture with energy and enthusiasm that is admittedly less cerebral and more visceral than the first film.The cartooned, somewhat clichÃÂ©d action figures, that Ripley reluctantly joins are literally thrust into a meat grinder of a bug hunt and they all make the most of their training and fight the terror with bravado and courage. These are not scientists, they are Marines and they behave like Marines and give the ultimate sacrifice. The movie is what it is and it is not the first film. It is a roller-coaster ride with little Intel and a lot of intensity.'""
""It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times.""
""'Let\'s start from the actors. We have Uma Thurman (a great role for her to display her power), we have the recently deceased David Carradine getting a chance to shine one more time. Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let\'s loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she\'s doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It\'s a shame, because quite a few things were promised. But then again, the Grindhouse experience hasn\'t hit home cinemas either ... we\'ll keep on waiting then ...'""
""The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens after 4 years in a coma. It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii.""

While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them.

He\'s a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life\'s tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...Robert Zemeckis\' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It\'s especially worth for Hanks\' awesome performance. He\'s all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator\'s attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he\'s doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don\'t get bored.Cast away is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks\'s face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis\' best movies.'""

""With the recent win at the Oscars for writing/directing brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, for No Country For Old Men, it was appropriate that some of their films be on TV, and this one was pretty good. Basically Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an ageing hippie, and mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, aka The Big Lebowski (David Huddlestone) who is a millionaire, by two thugs who pee on his carpet. The Dude is then drawn into a kidnap (possibly because of the mistaken identity) of The Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (American Pie's Tara Reid). It seems that many other people, not just the kidnappers, want something from The Dude, and all probably because they think he's the millionaire. For me, what kept me watching was the great performance by John Goodman as The Dude's aggressive bowling buddy, Walter Sobchak, a bear-like Vietnam-veteran with a serious temper, and a bit of a potty mouth. Also starring Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, John Turturro as Jesus Quintana, Harry Potter's David Thewlis as Knox Harrington and Sam Elliott as The Stranger (the one narrating). There were some funny moments, and the surreal dream sequences were interesting, and the performances (especially Goodman) were all great, so I don't see any reason not to see it. Very good!""
""This is the funniest of the Coen brother's films that I've seen to date.

When Lebowki's wife is kidnapped he asks The Dude to help deliver the ransom. While this is going on The Dude and his friends are also involved in preparations for a bowling match.From then on things get stranger and stranger in events featuring German nihilists, a pornographer, Lebowski's daughter and a bowler by the name of Jesus.The cast led by Jeff Bridges is excellent as the story is fun and in places rather surreal, if you don't mind a lot of swearing and enjoy a good laugh this film is a must see.""
""Pacifists vs. nihilists comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen is predictably (and amusingly) weird and lively, and so full of comic tension and malice that it is nearly irrelevant the 'plot' (as such) does peter out after the first hour. A bearded, unemployed, pot-smoking holdover from the '60s becomes entangled in corruption after he's hired to be the ransom-courier in a kidnapping. As the Dude, Jeff Bridges gives his all to this loose, shaggy character; the Dude is not just a textbook hipster, slacker or fish out of water, he's a laid-back guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generation's loss of morals, and he's so generally good-hearted that he's blindsided by violence and craven villainy. The Coens nearly outdo themselves in creating eccentric, mercurial characters, cutting twisty corners with an irony that isn't condescending or too obvious, and their cinematic conception of this material is often dazzling. *** from ****""
""Spoilers herein.The Coens shine into one of the bright zones in my film universe. They are intelligent and fun.I believe that they first select some intellectual issue related to problems of narrative, here identity. Then they, independently, select a film style to exploit, here screwball through Busby (instead of the screwball through Capra of `Hudsucker'). Then they run wild with all sorts of cinematic devices, always cinematic narrative.Of the Coen films I know, this is the most fantastic in terms of shifting realities. Hudsucker shifted often, but only into the `newspaper' mode of `It Happened One Night.' Here we have an arbitrary number of realities and levels, all unstructured which is the point. It is also a favorite because it has Julianne doing what she (and very few others) does best: playing a character who is acting. She gives us herself as the actress, the character as the actress (here an abstract painter) and the quite different character the character plays (the femnist family anchor). She's a gift that the Coens know how to use.The narrative ground zero is supplied by the countertop Cowboy as chorus. The `play within' is the Berkeley dream sequence.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.""

But back to this, which is as raw, tough and mental as you may remember it.I still haven\'t read the book this is based on, but the movie really lives up to the hype. If you haven\'t seen it yet, I reckon a double bill with the sequel is about to happen. It\'s actually something you should treat yourself with. And I\'m saying this a day before going into the second movie, but anticipations could not be much higher. Than again, riffing on Terminator with the T2 title shortening is a rather clever marketing plot. It also tells us: we will deliver a great sequel. And I believe they will. Will they be able to shock as they did with a couple of scenes in this one? That will be hard, especially a scene with a baby, the infamous toilet scene and much more is tough to beat ... which makes this such a great movie.

""'Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We\'re talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I\'d see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a thrill park ride. Now that doesn\'t mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don\'t compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is!

After all, I don\'t have a lot of interest in seeing a film about a bunch of loser heroin addicts--and that is the theme of Trainspotting.Some who watched this film felt it was a comedy--I noticed this when reading through the reviews. However, I really didn\'t find this film funny nor do I think most would think it funny. I guess my definition of funny isn\'t watching people injecting heroin, babies dying of neglect and people crapping themselves. You\'ll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film. While director Danny Boyle did a good job of making it all seem realistic, the film was so repellent that I can\'t understand its popular appeal.

Despite some confusion in the latter portion of the plot (as well as an unnecessary recap of visual highlights, as if from a TV mini-series), the film is slick and smooth, easily consumed, and often very exciting. Director James McTeigue carries us through the nastier elements of the plot without dwelling on the excesses (this isn\'t RoboCop), and Portman and masked Hugo Weaving are a scintillating pair. Brilliantly designed and photographed, with amusing soundtrack choices and a satisfying finale. *** from ****'""
""'The feelings about it , seeing time by time, are less clear. It is a good film but the references are so obvious, the clash against aspects of near reality so present, than it is very hard to be real enthusiatic. Sure, it can be a warning, portrait of dictatorship, definition of high need of freedom, a form of parody, use of Gunpower plot, Brave New World or 1984 for a sort of manifesto. So, it is good as answer of frustrations, conspiracy theories or people under tyranies. But can it be more ? Sure , Natalie Portman gives a good role, John Hurt reminds 1984 for the change of places, but, after a time, the film, source of enthusiasmus after the first discover of it, seems too... simplistic.

The group is saved by a Celestial, Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) is being ostracized by the other Ravagers and faces a mutinous crew.This is a visual overload of wildly colored space fantasy with unending quips. The first Guardian is refreshing for that idea but it gets a little repetitive with a sequel. The freshest scenes are Nebula's obsessive murderous rage against Gamora, and Baby Groot's inability to get Yondu's hat. There is some heart with Yondu and the sisters. It has some fun but a lot of it feels overloaded. At times, I pine for more of the quieter moments to let the characters deal with their feelings or simply reset my color receptors. Kurt is Kurt and is really perfect as Quill's father. I want the movie to take its time with the emotional turmoil but like a lot of these superhero movies, the pacing has to maintain its freight train momentum. Overall, this is fun but it can't be new again. It expands on the characters but it can't stop to smell the roses.""

The only good part was when Wallace was executed.Plot summary: Mel Gibson sets out to make an anti-English movie, because that was the phase he was going though (The Patriot was even worse), and wins a few Oscars in the process.Also a great example of how clueless the people are who determine the Oscar winners. In a year that brought such fantastic movies as Leaving Las Vegas, The Usual Suspects, Dead Man Walking, Twelve Monkeys and Richard III, they gave five Oscars, incl Best Picture and Best Director, to this piece of crap.'""
'I see it as one of most inspired films about faith. The faith to an ideal. The faith as expression of love. And duty. that does it special. And defines Mel Gibson as a great director. The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene. Impecable made. Great using each detail. A film about the essence of freedom. And about the price for give to it sense and form and blood.'

The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love, to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun.

Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for The Time Machine, LA Confidential, and more recently Iron Man 3, but I think he will always be remembered for Memento. He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.'""

Decades later, I've finally watched it for the first time and the experience has reaffirmed all of the negativity I associate with Disney animation.This is over-simplistic, spoon-fed pulp for the masses. The story is copied from HAMLET and simplified to get rid of all the complexity. The characters are trite and one-dimensional without anything in the way of depth or motivation. Jeremy Irons' bad guy is that just because. The positive thing about this is that the character animation is very good indeed, although I found the backdrops simplistic in the extreme.

""'Writer-director Quentin Tarantino\'s 8th film, as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people\'s idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock\'s new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter\'s 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus The Thing (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott\'s Alien from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino\'s belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story\'s context, is welcomed), though the film\'s 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a Chapter Five prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson\'s excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we\'re snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone\'s ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****'""
""While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,\nthey are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.""

He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play.

The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment').

'After much hype Star Wars returns with the three prequels that will probably continue to divide fans for the rest of time. Visually the film is stunning (by 1999 standards) with the final fight scene and the pod race in particular being very good.The acting is also pretty good with Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor bouncing off of each other as master and apprentice Jedi. However it is in the storytelling that this film falls flat and the overall tone of the film wavers from being a sort of kiddie friendly outing to more of a political space epic and ends up failing to be either successfully. Overall a good starting place for the series and one that younger fans will relish but may leave those familiar with the older films not feeling the full force.'

In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin\'s USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the other (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.Anyway, it\'s a good thing that they broke the final book into two movies. So far, they\'re doing a really good job not only bringing the magic to the screen, but also warning of the dangers that totalitarian entities - represented here by the Death Eaters - pose. I recommend it.Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Julie Walters reprise their roles from the previous movies, with new additions Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans.'""
""'Independence Day is essentially one big clichÃÂ© after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie. The story is generic and predictable, yes, but it still has a lot of entertainment value. And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie clichÃÂ© and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie. The spaceships were a nice design. But the aliens, both in and out of their exo-suits were really impressive, and they alone make it fun to watch the movie.Independence Day is a star-filled movie, boasting talents such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Viviva A. Fox, James Rebhorn, Brent Spinner and many more. People did good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is a fun and fast-paced movie that is well-worth watching if you enjoy action Sci-Fi movies, just look past the American propaganda and endless clichÃÂ©s. Take it for what it is; an enjoyable action Sci-Fi movie.'""
""ID4 works as a sci-fi action film with humans against aliens.  But the story is used from other alien movies and the characters are thin and usual for these movies.  Still, this is a big action apocalypse that hs attracted audiences all over the world.  Most likely though, this film hasx a message. What message i it?  Well, the scene where the White house and Empire State building shows how if you are in the theater, you'll cheer like FDR was president forever.  Maybe the message is were already in apocalypse, and only Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum will save us.  Great entertainment all around.  A""
""Spoilers herein.The thing that made `Bladerunner' special was that every element from the story to the movements of actor and camera to the sets to the colors were of one mind. It was successful science fiction and successful film because it was coherent. One man had the vision in all these areas and the skills to blend them in complementary ways. There are many such films, but they get fewer, the more special effects are involved.That's because so many of the key elements of the vision and narrative are delegated to others, all over the planet, with different design sensibilities and philosophies. Here, that problem is immense, and we have enough experience with this filmmaker on prior projects to know he cannot control a smaller hive.Add to this minor incompetences of minor lives (Smith, Goldblum and so on) and a script literally borrowed from the prior catalog. And what you are left with is a film whose entire marketing campaign (hundreds of millions) and central appeal is built on blowing up the White House. Hard to imagine today how much fun that must have seemed.Ted's Rating: 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.""
""One nice thing about this is the casting of McKellan and Stewart. Despite the latter's adventures with the stupid StarTrek, he is an intelligent actor, as is McKellan. They tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should. About bad acting, can we be spared from Ms. Berry in the future?The photography is overloaded on face supercloseups, and the tone is suitably dark. None of the sets thrill.What's awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are. Thrown into the same blender are Nazi mass murder, Nazi experimentation, radioactive fallout, mind control, US war-time mutant experiments (to come more explicitly when we find out about Wolverine), religious righteousness in the Senate, one-world governments, the hidden x-men, and the evil mutants-who-are-sometimes-merely-mistaken. Are there supposed to be bad guys? What's the central struggle? There's not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver. It's paranoia in the comix, which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film. How can that be?The ultimate Marvel film should come from Dr Strange. Give it to Ridley Scott to direct, Kenneth Branagh as the Doctor. dark, intelligent, spooky, Kafkaesque.""
""If you are a fan of the popular comics about the mutant super heroes, then you'll love this movie. It is mainly focused on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who meets outcast mutant Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin) and they both go to a secret place which has all young and old mutants studying, and of course, the headquarters of The X-Men. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier, the commander of The X-Men, he believes that Rogue and Wolverine can be part of the team, along with Jean Grey (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry). Meanwhile, the evil Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) along with Toad (Ray Park), Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and the gorgeous Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) want to find Wolverine and make him part of his team. Personally, the second film's better. Good!""
""Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power.""
""So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages.""

That\'s because Superman\'s Red Cape and Blue Onesie ARE part of his Birthday Suit (making him a good bet to win any game of strip poker). Perhaps the biggest revelation of VERSUS is that the moms of every D.C. Comic Super Hero are named Martha, just like the Mother of Our Country (Mrs. Washington). That\'s because the D.C. Boys and their Picturizers (Warner Bros.) are a pretty patriotic pack, and they realize that the only good E.T. is a dead E.T. While Marvel\'s Mob of Mutants gets thousands of Muggles murdered in each of their outings, Superman gets raked over the coals here for the least little smidgen of collateral damage.

""'This movie essentially begins where the film Man of Steel ended except that it comes from the point-of-view of Batman (Ben Affleck) and all he is seeing is the carnage left in Superman\'s wake. On the other hand, Superman (Henry Cavill) has become aware of the actions of Batman and he doesn\'t like what he considers him to be--a dark and sinister vigilante operating outside the boundaries of the legal system. Meanwhile, a psychotic genius named Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has his own plan to kill Superman and it involves manipulating Batman to do the job for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that comic book fans who enjoy action-packed films will probably like this movie. However, it is not without its faults. For starters, it had a number of different sub-plots which weren\'t allowed to develop due to the multitude of action scenes. Additionally, while the character of Batman thrives in a dark and gloomy setting, I don\'t believe that it suits Superman nearly as much and it remains to be seen whether the director (Zach Snyder) fully appreciates that. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, regardless of the flaws I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.'""
""'Actually, it\'s better than the first!First off, see Fellowship of the Ring or you won\'t be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There\'s battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn\'t impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can\'t wait for Return of the King!'""

Cruise is fine, but as ever - he is just himself and his character once we get to know him a bit is rather an unlikable, selfish fellow with precious little to redeem him. Morgan Freeman seems there to make up the numbers, his appearances offer little to really develop the derivative plot and in the end we are left with a very well constructed visual feast that has very little filling.

Even if you\'re concerned about nuclear proliferation and figure that this movie might warn about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust, Oblivion comes across only as a movie produced with the aim of making a zillion dollars.

As for me, I don\'t particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn\'t a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn\'t boring.I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don\'t feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it\'s a decent film but nothing more.'""
""This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film.However despite it's long running time The Half Blood Prince element feels rushed and the Harry and Ginny relationship forced. Even the wonderful ending of the original book is underplayed.Yates manages to bring a lightness of touch to quite a dark installment but stays true to what will come in the future films. I didn't initially like this film but now, seeing it as part of the overall saga am convinced it is one of the strongest.""

We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Samantha seems more than a program and he finds himself falling for her more than any real human being.One thing is certain. Spike Jonze is an original. Scarlett plays Samantha like a real human being. I like the concept but I'm not sure if it's as good of a movie as everybody is saying. There is something about a real relationship that works best with human contact. Even a long distance relationship has two physical persons on the screen. The lack of a human body really holds it back although that's the point. She is a fantasy like a 1-900 number. It's just a very sophisticated version. It tries to get weird with a third person. However it could never be weird enough. I'm reminded of Cronenberg's Videodrome where James Woods dive into kissing the TV. It never goes that far. It approaches going for the next level but the movie fizzles out. It takes a weak way to wrap things up. In the end, Theodore is let off the hook.

Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another.

He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?""

""I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.""

""A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside.

""'Great movie - funny and moving. Engaging and emotive, with some hilarious scenes. Takes a while to get going, but once it does, it moves along at a brisk pace.Great performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.Historic movie too. The first funny, non-dull and unpretentious French movie. Also the first French movie to not be all about people contemplating the meaning of life for 90+ minutes and then at least one of them committing suicide at the end (spoiler alert).'""
""'This film is about the lives of the people in the City of God, a place full of violence and lawlessness.City of God is powerful, partly through the shocking events, and also the effective story telling. There is not a moment of boredom or time filler. The events portrayed in City of God are so shocking. Lives are constantly lost due to random fights and shootouts. Lives have no value, and we only see a mourning scene once in the entire film. Towards the end of the film, I feel my spine tingling with fear and shock. I am left in bewilderment as to how people can be so ruthless and merciless. City of God seems to be a place where humanity descends to the lowest level possible. City of God leaves me entranced even after the film ended. It\'s really powerful.'""
""This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.\nCrowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles are:Oliver Reed, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie. Your heart will not let you forget this movie.This will be one for the ages.""
""'Brilliant.Set in a notorious slum of Rio - Cidade de Deus / City of God - the story of a boy who sees his friends and brother grow up or aspire to be gangsters, and decides to do something else. Meanwhile we also see the power struggles in the neighbourhood, how they developed, who the main protagonists are and the state of their feud.A superb story, well told. While the story ultimately spans a few decades, there is no excess detail, and the movie never drifts or is boring. Incredibly gritty.Solid performances too.A classic.'""
""'When I say horrible I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film\'s conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It\'s just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there\'s no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I\'m sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there\'s an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It\'s really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class. But, the sight of a room full of naked teens with their penises a-dangling changed my mind!'""
""'I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON\'T want to talk about the plot of The Force Awakens-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don\'t think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.'""

""Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10""

It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first Iron Man again which isn\'t too bad, just predictable.

""I read one good review of this movie and found out many online like it, so I let my movie theatre-working friend recommended me to watch it. He, himself, had seen it several times by the time I just watched it with him and he seemed to enjoy it once again as we were viewing this on the IMAX 3-D screen. It's basically a prequel to the original Star Wars-the one now called Episode IV: A New Hope-concerning characters not seen before which we find out at the end why. There are some familiar characters that do appear like the villain Darth Vader (once again voiced by James Earl Jones) and R2D2 and C3PO. There's also an appearance of Princess Leia as she originally appeared in that original Star Wars pic. I guess computer imagery really can make the impossible possible! Anyway, that's my recommendation to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. P.S. As I'm writing this, it's now the second day of Carrie Fisher's death. All I'll say now is-Rest in Peace, Princess Leia. P.P.S. I just found out her mother Debbie Reynolds has also passed not long after.""
""'This film is about four magicians who team up to perform the most spectacular magical heists ever seen in history.Now You See Me tells the story of how four magicians perform the unbelievable heists while on stage, such as robbing a bank in Paris while they are on stage in Las Vegas. They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it\'s magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.Now You See Me is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza.

The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. Interstellar is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand.

""'I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It\'s about magicians, but also about crime. It\'s also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It\'s been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven\'t seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as Now you see me is)!

""Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before.""
""'Russell Crowe\'s stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely. No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured. Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his unsuitable private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.'""
""'A Beautiful Mind is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I\'d say more, but I don\'t want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash\'s mental illness--something he\'s struggled with for many years.I enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it\'s SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man\'s life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn\'t particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe\'s accent. I don\'t know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.'""
""This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it.""

It was her sister Princess Anna that does most of the heavy lifting in the picture, and is also the one that actually develops a love interest in the story, somewhat without her awareness at the time, but a love interest nevertheless. I say all that without any particular bias, it was just a bit surprising to see in a Disney film. My granddaughter was a huge fan of this movie when it came out, four years old at the time, and singing \'Let It Go\' with abandon after seeing it a number of times. As a retired senior citizen, I saw it as another competent Disney film that joins the ranks of their other fine efforts over the years, though one doesn\'t have the same reaction one had when seeing their very first one around the same age as my granddaughter.

Director Rian Johnson brings out all the guns with amazing CGI fireworks (many battles and kick-ass light saber stand-offs) yet overall the screenplay he has cooked up fails with the new characters (which I will not mention since they all are rather lame and seriously Del Toro - your check is in the mail for sleepwalking thru this; shameful!) and some unusual shots of humor (taking pages out of Monty Python and Spaceballs) but continues the traditional theme of uniting via The Force to find your true inner spirit (Ridley and Driver excel as the new life force - yes, pun intended) and resolve.""
""Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'.""
""After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel.""
""Brad Pitt stars in this apocalyptic spectacle concerning a world-wide zombie uprising. A patchwork of scenes of zombies amok and a determined everyday man trying to stop a horrific pandemic. Sounds like money and a winner. Most everything in the life of former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane(Pitt)and his family are falling in line with many hopes and dreams. But how long do you think that peace and happiness lasts now days? Somehow a disease has caused zombies to attack those still pumping blood. Mindless zombies are threatening to spread a mysterious infection to all corners of the earth. Lane is reluctantly pressed into action and takes on the mission of traveling the globe to investigate this horrible calamity threatening mankind. Lane bravely goes against all odds in search of answers before there is nothing left but zombies feeding off of each other. Expect to be totally immersed with this gargantuan production from beginning to end. If Pitt can't pull this off, who can? Well, come on...you know what I mean. WORLD WAR Z is rated PG-13 due to graphic and disturbing images of zombie violence. Rounding out the cast: Mireille Enos, James Badge Dale, David Morse, Peter Capaldi, Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove.""
""'World War Z, directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt\'s character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.'""
""I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books.""
""I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper.""
""The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful.""
'Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police chief that takes charge of picking up the pieces of the crime that has come unraveled.Strong violence and foul language go hand in hand with the awkward and hilarious situations. You will certainly be eager to watch this one again immediately.'
""'Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law\'s money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a true story, which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens\' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****'""
""'If you don\'t know what mental illness is like, you might think this is a hilarious picture. It actually is in many respects, but if you haven\'t had any experience with people or family members dealing with mental health issues, you may not get the full impact of this film and what it means to remain in treatment and faithfully take prescribed medications. The writers either had that real life experience or did their research very faithfully, because the reactions of characters like Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are ones I\'ve observed personally with members of my own family. It\'s not always easy, and one must remain on the defensive more often than is comfortable when someone you care for is tortured by erratic mood swings and delusional thinking. It was struck home forcefully when Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) tells Pat in one of their sessions that one incident can change a lifetime. I can vouch for that and am thankful every day when the meds are working and life approaches a semblance of normalcy. I thought this was a brilliant movie in the way it offers hope to those afflicted with mental health issues of their own, and a way to deal with them effectively given the proper support of friends and loved ones.'""
""'Terrific and believable escape via troubled twosome. Life wasn\'t promised to be easy for Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper), spending eight months in a mental institution following his painful divorce only to be court ordered to move back home with his parents. Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro)and Delores(Jacki Weaver)try to understand their bipolar son, who insists on trying to cope with life without his medication in pursuit of a healthy living regime with hopes of reuniting with his ex-wife. Pat is looking hard for the silver linings in his life, when he meets another troubled soul, Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a self-proclaimed slut and woman of mystery since the death of her husband. Things really get complicated when the upbeat Tiffany offers to help the pathetic Pat reconnect with his ex. In return the fetching Tiffany wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition. Could this be a therapeutic aid in their individual therapy or a step toward a meaningful relationship between them. Lawrence is adorable, witty and hilarious. Cooper is as confusing as De Niro is deadpan funny. And the use of Stevie Wonder\'s My Cherie Amour is brilliant.

""I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine.""
""The old song that every cloud must have a silver lining is so very much appropriate to this 2012 film.Bradley Cooper, as a bipolar man recently discharged from a mental institution, gives a stellar performance in trying to reconnect with his unfaithful wife, the latter driving him to his outrageous behavior and subsequent institutionalization. He meets up with Tiffany, played in a sparkling way by the perky Jennifer Lawrence. They are both tremendous in their emotional outbursts and find through their multitude of problems that they're the perfect couple.Robert De Niro had his best part in years as Cooper's book-making father who wants to use watching television football with his son as a means of therapy. As the mother, Jacki Weaver received a totally undeserved Oscar nomination in the supporting category. Note that the above 3 thespians were all nominated with Lawrence winning and they were all deserved for Oscar consideration.Anyone suggest that Cooper and Miss Lawrence dance in Dancing with the Stars?""
""When my movie theatre-working friend suggested seeing a film yesterday, this was the only one currently out that neither of us had seen yet that I wanted to watch. And both of us were very glad for the choice! I mean, you wouldn't think a romantic comedy-drama about two emotionally or mentally depressed people possibly falling in love would hold much appeal but it did for me and my friend. And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence. Also so glad Ms. Lawrence got her Golden Globe and if she wins her Academy Award, I'll be even more happy! Really, despite all the messy emotions that are explored here or maybe because of all that, I really enjoyed and highly recommend Silver Linings Playbook!""
""But it's more than that! The story is great, the actors enjoy their roles. And so will you, if you watch the movie! The movie has many players, but still concentrates on one central one (George Clooney's) for your attention. But I was a little bit surprised that Don Cheadle is not listed in the credits (according to IMDb) ...It's style and funny dialogues from beginning to the end. Andy Garcia is a great villain here too. Someone you like to see fall down. But the question is, does he? You'll have to see the movie for that. Be excited, be very excited! Especially if you know the Original (with Frank Sinatra and others), because this movie is an example, that a remake can in fact not only be as good as the Original, but be even better! Watch it and you'll see! :o)""
""Sharp, canny, dashing remake of the Frank Sinatra Rat Packer from 1960 about the ultimate Las Vegas heist. Master thief George Clooney and pal Brad Pitt enlist a disparate group of con-artists to rob billionaire casino owner Andy Garcia of his millions in his highly-guarded vault--and, just for good measure, his girl too. Wonderfully fast and hip, with a sleek direction by Steven Soderbergh (who never stops teasing the audience) and a glittering array of stars and character actors, all of whom get a good slice of the pie. Of course, the byzantine (and expensive) plot these guys concoct could never be duplicated in reality--and that outlandishness does spoil some of the fun. Still, the cartoony way this motley crew takes over the Bellagio, with Soderbergh's camera zipping around the action like a fox, provides high entertainment the whole way through. *** from ****""
""I'm aware that it is a remake of an earlier film but as I've not seen that I can't say if it is as good or not. This is a fun caper film with a star cast who all appear to be having a great time, that isn't to say that they don't do a good job however.The film opens with Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, being released from prison. He has no plans of going straight though, he has a job planned, a big job that will require a large team of expert criminals. The job in question is robbing a Las Vegas casino, something considered impossible by most people but he thinks he has found away.The early part of the film concentrates on recruiting the team and their preparations for the job itself, when they start their on site preparations it becomes clear that money isn't Danny's only motivation for robbing this particular casino; its owner is going out with his ex-wife. The robbery itself is pretty exciting even though the viewer is never in much doubt that nothing bad will happen to our anti-heroes, after all it is a fun film not a gritty drama.I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch a fun will that doesn't contain lots of violence, it might not be all that realistic but if you can suspend your disbelief it is a well made, well acted caper film.""
""'Ocean\'s 11 was the first in what became an unwanted trilogy, but I think most people forget the others and just watch this one.And it\'s not actually that bad a film. It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There\'s lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of how can you not like this film? way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn\'t have been a trilogy at all.'""
""'The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.'""
""'I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message a great cook can come from anywhere, summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O\'Toole in a marvellous turn as the nasty food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.'""
""I agree this Blu-Ray transfer is stunning, magnificent to view in many spots with very, very rich colors. Yet, I couldn't get into this story and was turned off my several of the main characters. I gave it two shots: on regular DVD and Blu-Ray and both times I never finished the film. I just interest. Only the mouse was likable enough for me. The humans were all too annoying to enjoy the film.These other characters were either too loud, obnoxious, nasty or irritating including the kid whom the rat helped! In other words - except for the mouse - both the good and bad guys were unlikable.All they these characters did was give me a headache with all their yelling and screaming. You have to love the silent mouse, though.""
""'(Spoilers Ahead)Though Schindler\'s List is the best film on the horror that was the holocaust, Life Is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella in Italian) is way up there. And I enjoyed it.

Half of the film surrounds Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni won a well deserved best actor Oscar as Guido, along with a second Oscar for best Foreign film as director and writer) as a Italian-Jewish waiter who is in love with a princess.  This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp.

""'Unbelievably enough, then it is only now in 2013 that I got around to actually watching The Dark Knight. Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with The Dark Knight, then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in The Dark Knight is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then The Dark Knight really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, The Dark Knight offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.The Dark Knight was a major step upwards from Batman Begins, and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch The Dark Knight Rises as well.'""

It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.
""Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet.""

Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles.""
""'Monsters Inc came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as Toy Story, A Bug\'s Life, Shrek, and Disney\'s Tarzan are in. First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy kitty with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn\'t even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!'""
""For me District 9 is neither a masterpiece or a bad movie, instead it is an interesting but not entirely successful kind of movie.For a low budget movie, District 9 does look excellent. The cinematography, editing and effects are very, very good, and I did accept the aliens appearance wise. The soundtrack and sound also create a sense of foreboding and genuine atmosphere, the concept is amazing and the film does start off brilliantly. The acting overall by a largely unknown cast is good, as is the direction, and the lead characters are likable.What didn't impress me so much, is that while District 9 does have heart, that I could see from how it was made and the enthusiasm of the actors and director, I wasn't entirely involved. As I've said, the film starts off with no problem, but the final third with plot points that were either rushed and underdeveloped or silly or clichÃÂ©d wasn't so good. The story doesn't quite live up to the concept for me, it was intriguing and thoughtfully handled but thin, the support characters aren't as well-thought out or as likable as the leads, the dialogue has some sketchiness that is particularly evident in the slower parts and final third and the pace does get sluggish sometimes.Overall, I did like it and was intrigued by it, but sorry it isn't a movie I would see again in a hurry. 6/10 Bethany Cox""
""I'm cross with this film. It has the makings of a really good teen comedy. But there are two things which completely spoil it.One is the incessant foul language. It is completely unnecessary, adds nothing, and after a while it got on my nerves. The sex references are part of the story and didn't bother me at all, but the F word is simply used as a meaningless punctuation sound interjected into nearly every sentence uttered by nearly every character.The other was the character of Seth. I liked every character in the film - even the two idiot cops - except for odious, mouthy, obnoxious, self-centred, offensive, single-mindedly stupid Seth.I'm not sure how much of this movie was scripted and how much was improvised, but the character of Seth drops this film by two grades and the bad language by a further one. So if you don't mind non-stop pointless bad language, and you're happy for your central character to annoy you from the very first frame to the last, then I would grade this a 9 for you!""
""After about a month of playing theatres, I finally got to see Superbad with my friend after seeing the other movies that had come out that we wanted to see. My friend liked it though he thought it had too much profanity. I didn't have a problem with the language but I did think the funny stuff came in little doses between several scenes that dragged. I liked the performances of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Chris Mintz-Plasse as the high school seniors trying to get laid two weeks before graduation as well as the slacker cops played by Bill Hader and the movie's co-writer Seth Rogen. But their performances weren't enough to make this a hilariously funny movie like I usually expect from producer Judd Apatow who had no hand in writing this movie like he had in his previously very funny directorial outings, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Still, despite its unevenness, Superbad does get points for making the main characters' growing pains seem real and for getting the potential girlfriends of Hill and Cera not seem like such sluts...""
""'Maybe back then you couldn\'t tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they\'d have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That\'s something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as Superbad obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea.

""Superbad (2007): Dir: Greg Mottola / Cast: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse; Emma Stone, Seth Rogen: Surprisingly hilarious teen comedy that despite its preference for toilet humour, it is done with wit and intelligence. It transcends those thoughts and actions of our youthful desires. Greg Mottola's film stars foul mouth Jonah Hill and timid Michael Cera who risk much to achieve booze for a party in hopes of bedding a couple of girls. Setup stems perhaps from experience but structure is basically one failed booze steal after another until it reaches a surprisingly acceptable conclusion. Hill is terrific in his foul mouth demeanor as he sets his sights on one goal and risks much to achieve it. Cera is more reserved yet also discovers young love. Christopher Mintz-Plasse pretty much dominates the film as nerdy Fogell whose fake ID contains the name McLovin. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen steal scenes as two inexperienced cops out to relive their youth, and see the opportunity through McLovin. Emma Stone plays the standard yet well played inspiration of Hill. Martha McIsaac plays her best friend whom Cera is smitten with and who Hill dislikes. Director Mottola avoid sentimentalism and creates a film that plays both for theme and hilarity. Trash humour and a theme regarding that mischievous youth in us but also long term friendships that are there when things go from bad to super bad. Score: 9 / 10""
""'I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book The Hunger Games or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!'""

Of course Captain America can\'t catch the humor.Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.'""
""'In a future world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.When this film came out, it was huge. Probably Gilliam\'s biggest success to that time, and possibly still his biggest success today (2014), though he continues to make great films. And looking back on it, approximately twenty years later, it is as good as ever. They took La Jetee and fleshed out an entire world.Beyond the great concept, excellent sets and impressive cast (Brad Pitt in a break-out role) is a story that is so cleverly layered. Is Cole a time traveler? Is he crazy? Is the Army of the 12 Monkeys real? Who are they? And can the future be changed?'""
""'Twelve monkeys\'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam\'s masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. Twelve monkeys is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in Die hard). No matter how he tries, he\'s a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It\'s got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, twelve monkeys will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.'""
I like the bit with the monkeys. I didn't count them so I can't confirm if there are 12 or not
""While my friend wanted to watch this movie because he's a big fan of Brad Pitt, I was simply more interested in the premise and the fact it was shot in my neighboring city of New Orleans whose scenery is breathtaking here (the fact that present scenes are set during Hurricane Katrina was also a fine dramatic touch). Pitt is quite touching as a man aging backwards in time and I loved the romantic scenes with both Tilda Swinton as the middle-aged wife of a spy and Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend Daisy especially her dancing scenes. Those scenes on the tug boat with that tattoo captain were also good especially the wartime sequences. If there's one quibble, it's that I didn't see enough of Queenie's daughter to really discern how she got along with either her mother or her brother Ben. Otherwise, this was a fine piece of work from director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth who mined similar adapted territory when he previously worked on Forest Gump.""
""It's the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Revolutionaries take over the American embassy and over 60 personnel are taken hostage. Six are able to escape to the residence of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). CIA expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) devises a crazy plan to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew.For a well known history and predestine ending, this is quite compelling, tense, and suspenseful. Affleck did take some liberties with the real story. About midway onwards, there are a few too many liberties taken to Hollywood it up. They even gin up a car chase. I understand drama has to be pump up. It's really a minor defect. The movie is filled with great acting, tense moments, and even has a few laughs. Of the Oscar nominees, I'd probably pick 'Django Unchained' and this solidly in second.""
""'This Oscar winning film of 2012 is a true story dealing with the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-80, the ultimate crisis that made Jimmy Carter a one term president.Angered by the acceptance of the cancer stricken Shah of Iran to America, the Iranians invaded our embassy there and took many people hostage. The story deals with the attempt of our CIA launching a covert action to free the 6 people in the embassy who had fled at the time of its take-over and were granted asylum in the Canadian Embassy.The plot involves a phony movie production of Argo, a phony film which would be used to get the six people out of the country.Alan Arkin and John Goodman really provided comic relief by working with our government to create this false attempt at movie making so as to fool the Iranians.As the 6 prepare to leave, tension builds in some very grueling scenes, as they appear to run into roadblocks in their attempt to flee the country.'""
""Somewhat-overrated suspense film with 'colorful' Hollywood overtures involves Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, real-life exfiltration specialist for the CIA whose bold plan in 1980 it was to get six Americans home from strife-ridden Iran, where they have been in-hiding since November 1979 when the U.S. Embassy was stormed by protesters over the CIA's involvement in Iranian politics. Mendez concocts a genuinely flamboyant plan--disguising the terrified group as Canadian filmmakers in the country to do pre-production work for a science-fiction film--but nothing about Affleck's leadweight performance suggests this kind of imaginative thinking. Affleck, who also co-produced and directed the film, does a good job at laying out the complicated scenario, however his button-pushing tactics at the final gate (leading to a nick-of-time climax) are a bit cheap. Audiences may feel the good will, and certainly the milieu is vividly captured. Alan Arkin, as a passed-his-prime movie producer, and John Goodman, as a Hollywood makeup artist, are both fine in support, though this section of the picture is undernourished. **1/2 from ****""
""A life-long fan of Basil Rathbone's classic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, I had my reservations about Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of the character, particularly with Guy Ritchie directing (let's not forget that the man was responsible for turning Vinnie Jones into a movie star!).As expected, this 21st century reinvention of Conan Doyle's great detective bears very little resemblance to any previous movie incarnation, Downey Jr. playing the sleuth as a scruffy, smug, loutish, and reckless brawler, while sidekick Watson (Jude Law) is considerably smarterÃ¢ÂÂand handier with his fistsÃ¢ÂÂthan Nigel Bruce ever was.Seeing the usually dapper detective and the equally eminent doctor portrayed in such manner is hard to come to terms with, but wasn't a deal-breaker for meÃ¢ÂÂI can appreciate a new spin on an old themeÃ¢ÂÂbut the asinine script and unnecessarily flashy direction sadly was. An illogical, plot-hole ridden piece of guff, the film is peppered with juvenile humour and heavily stylised action set-pieces in a desperate effort to try and detract from the many weaknesses and flaws in the narrative, which start with a highly implausible fake execution and become more and more strained as the movie progresses.As a piece of mindless popcorn nonsense, I guess this fares no worse than many a modern Hollywood blockbuster, but as a case for the finest crime-busting mind the world has ever known, it's far from brilliant.""
""Guy Ritchie transforms Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stoic and methodical super sleuth into a scruffy, rough and tough detective; not exactly the great Basil Rathbone. Robert Downey Jr. earns his Golden Globe starring as London's legendary Sherlock Holmes. His trusted side-kick Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law. Rachel McAdams stars as the only woman to best Holmes and continues a very testy relationship with the detective. Holmes and Watson will face off against a mysterious villain named Blackstone(Mark Strong). Plenty of thrills mixed with violence and action comedy. Very interesting chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. Well photographed. Apt supporting cast featuring: Eddie Marsan, William Houston, Kelly Reilly, Hans Matheson and Robert Maillet.""
""If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013""
""Books should not be compared to movies. Movie versions should not be compared to each other. If you are a true artist, you always put your stamp on your production. The stories of Arthur Conan Doyle are masterpieces and they have had their time. If one is willing to come up with a new angle using the characters as perceived by the public, more power to him. There have been hundreds of pastiches done with the Holmes canon. Anyway, the film before us uses a preposterous plot that has angered the purists. It's probably some of the same people who died a little each day after Lord of the Rings and Spiderman came out. This film is a joyful mess in the tradition of Indian Jones. The two principles, Holmes and Watson grow on us and take us on a merry ride through London into some pretty weird stuff. It doesn't matter what has been done before, just enjoy the ride and look to the future. But don't forget the wonderful efforts of Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. They can, indeed, coexist.""
""Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to get out of his rut. He needs to pick up his game with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He needs to connect more with his mother (Penelope Wilton).

It's the zombie apocalypse and he doesn't notice at all. After Liz dumps him, he has an all night drinking session with Ed. In the morning, the clueless duo come face to face with the walking dead.It's a little slow at the start. It takes awhile to lay down the foundations. Once they start fighting the zombies, the movie is hilarious. Nick Frost is crazy funny. It's a great new irreverent take on the zombie movie.""
""'This film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreak.Shaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction. Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one.'""
""'I\'ve read a lot about how Shaun of the Dead borrows a lot from a TV show called Spaced. I have to admit that I\'ve never heard of Spaced. But even so, this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it\'s sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it, and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I\'d never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing SOTD, but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline\'s wife in Cry Freedom) and Bill Nighy.'""
""This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience.""

They have kidnapped Indy\'s father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ\'s blood while interring him. It\'s up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there\'s a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.'""
""I enjoyed this film. Eastwood is about as snarly as I've ever seen him. He has taken Archie Bunker to the next level. He terrorizes his neighbors, is hateful to his children, and incredibly intolerant of a changing world. With that said, this is a story about redemption. It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.lThe whole thing kind of slides off into predictability toward the end, but it's a good story and had to end some way, especially with Kowalski's self realizations and his rendezvous with death. The other thing is just watching a masterful actor take on this role and squeeze every last drop out of it.""

It might as well be the man with no name in the hood. Clint is acting with a bunch of nobodies. That's the biggest problem in this movie. The other actors are not up to snuff. The only one capable is the girl Ahney Her who can only really hold her own.In the end, we love this Clint character. That's all that matters. He is compelling, and we have all grown up with this character. We know him. The movie is the better for it.""
""Why has this movie and its director/star been ignored by the Oscar committee? Clint Eastwood plays Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Walt is recently widowed, but obviously has been crusty and rough around the edges and bigoted and prejudiced for most of his life. Still living in the old neighborhood he is uncomfortable with the Hmong family that have become his new neighbors. He will soon reluctantly befriend the young girl Sue Lor(Ahney Her)and her brother Thao Vang(Bee Vang), who actually tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. When crusty Walt defends the brother and sister from a rivalry gang of the Hmong family, he becomes treated as the neighborhood's guardian angel. My favorite scenes are any and all with Sue Lor answering Walt's non-PC and bigoted comments matching him barb for barb. GRAN TORINO in spite of being pretty predictable, it is a heart-felt human drama finding comedy in indifference.Also in the cast: Brian Howe, Brian Haley, Brooke Chia Thao, Chee Thao and Scott Eastwood, you know who's son.""

Desperate father Keller decides to take matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex, hiding him behind a false wall and battering him regularly into a confession.This is one of the darkest, most bleak films I can remember, almost slightly too bleak in terms of tone, a wee bit too harrowing in parts, that said it was exceptionally well acted, well directed, and definitely one of those films that stirs the emotions. I wish it wasn't so long, it seemed to go on forever.Far from being a feel good film, it's violence with linger with you long after the credits have rolled.Paul Dano was brilliant in his part, such a good actor, possibly the best element of the film, although Jackman puts in a stellar performance too.

""I'm not an expert on the Bond canon, but I love Daniel Craig, especially after seeing him on stage in A Steady Rain, and I admire much of Sam Mendes' work.I found Skyfall to be fun and exciting. It cost a fortune and looked it.Nothing original about the plot - a stolen list of agents - this is the latest plot for many spy films. Also I agree with one of the reviews here that I read - the list just seems to get forgotten about.What I can't believe is that people pick these films apart as if they're supposed to be realistic. There is nothing realistic about them, so why ask why Naomi only had one bullet etc. In these types of films, you have to just go with them.Judi Dench as M, who is in danger here, is marvelous, and Javier Bardem is an absolute scary, crazy scream as Bond's nemesis. Daniel Craig is wonderfully handsome and in excellent shape. He's a brilliant actor and totally wasted in these films, but I suppose the money is fantastic.Ralph Fiennes lets his receding hairline show and drops his leading man status here, and he gives a steely performance.There are enough explosions, car chases, fights, shootings, and train wrecks to last a lifetime. But it's nonstop action and nonstop entertainment. Don't analyze this type of film too much. Just go along for the ride and hope someone doesn't blow up the car.""

Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.But the animated movie isn\'t so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of head office. It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley\'s Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley\'s Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.I like it for the novelty, it makes one think.'""
This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters. This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today. No matter how many films Dreamworks milk the Shrek franchise for it will never have the heart or the humour of Toy Story.

Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****""
""'Pixar became a household name in 1995 with Toy Story, about cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his rival, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who have to rely on each other\'s abilities and intuition to survive a snafu.I guess that this wasn\'t a masterpiece in the general sense of the word, but it\'s impressive nonetheless (who would have guessed that Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn would ever do voices in a cartoon?). And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head\'s lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser). But other than that, there\'s nothing objectionable here. Very interesting.'""
'I can see why this was a big hit at the time. Well made and with enough wit and references for the adults to enjoy it. Pixar brought in a whole new style of animation here and blew away the increasingly old-fashioned Disney hits.'
""'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as Woody and Allen as Buzz Armstrong, I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed winner as is the sequel.'""
""'I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn\'t allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The real plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy\'s donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit. Nothing ever enters his brain without immediately going to his mouth. This is a fun film, and even if it does go for bathroom humor, it done with great aplomb!'""
""This animated fantasy is far and beyond others in the genre. This is the standard others will be judged by for a long time to come.

Shrek is offered his swamp vacated if he retrieves the pretty princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and brings her to the midget ruler for marriage.The crude 'potty' humor is mild and does not distract from the clever written story line; and this comedy can't help but amuse viewers of all ages. Myers of course has the top billing, but I think Murphy steals the whole show. I think the witty donkey could carry his own movie someday. SHREK lives up to and deserves all of its accolades. Take the time to experience a superb story of love and companionship.""

However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film\'s appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn\'t quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I\'ll just end it here!'""
""What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox""
""I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox.""
""'I\'d never heard of Audrey Tautou when Le fabuleux destin d\'Amelie Poulain (called Amelie in English) came out, but I gotta say that she is one great actress (not to mention really hot).

Jean-Pierre Jeunet would later cast Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon in the equally good - if gut-wrenchingly violent - Very Long Engagement. It all continues his well done streak started by Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children (he also directed Alien: Resurrection, but that\'s another story).All in all, you\'re sure to love every aspect of Amelie.

I know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life. I on the other hand was pained from the get go, finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile.

Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think Iron Man 2 is worth watching just for the ending alone.

""With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies.

I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it.

My only beef with this one is that Mickey Rourke\'s portrayal of the villain comes across as awkward; he\'s played lots of good roles, but he\'s the wrong person to cast as a Russian. I guess that we can ignore that and luxuriate in the title character\'s antics. I haven\'t seen The Avengers (or most of the other superhero movies from the past few years; there are so many that I can\'t tell which is which).Basically, we can recognize the movie as nice brain candy.

""What a family! And I'm not only talking about the Pixar family, but about the Incredibles family. An adventure for everyone. Pixar has another great movie up their sleeves. If they continue like that, the Top 100 List here on IMDb will solely exist/consist with their movies in there! Seriously though: The Incredibles takes the Superhero movie genre and takes it's own spin on it. I wouldn't say it spoofs the Superhero world, it just a funny movie, that happens to play in a world with Superheroes. Of course the voice talent on hand here does the story justice, as with the other Pixar movies. A fun-filled adventure that you shouldn't miss.""
""'The Incredibles is fun, entertaining, visual splendid and it has some great action sequences.The power of this movie is in its great timing and solid main characters. The voice cast consists, unlike many other animated movies out of actors that are not \'hot\' at the moment. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are not exactly popular actors, that will draw lots of people to the theaters when you put their names on a poster. That\'s not why they were cast, they were just simply cast because they have great voices. I\'ve always liked Holly Hunter\'s voice and accent and it was great to finally hear her in an animated movie. The rest of the cast mainly consists out of people that made their debut with this movie (Except for Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee of course.). Kudos to that, I\'m sure they could had attached some big \'hot\' names to this project but they went for quality and the best instead of for the most popular.OK the story ain\'t exactly anything special but the main characters and fun feeling of the movie compensates for this. Also the action sequences know to impress. The action sequences feel like you\'re right in the middle of playing a computer game.

There is the Bond-like volcano hideout. There are the great superhero inside jokes. This is a well written movie.""
""'Previously, the only Taken with which I was familiar was the TV miniseries executive produced by Steven Spielberg (focusing on extraterrestrials). If I had heard the plot of this movie and knew nothing else about it, I would probably have assumed that it stars Harrison Ford. What a surprise that Liam Neeson plays a former government agent searching for his kidnapped daughter, using rather aggressive tactics. Seriously, some of what he does just might count as torture.What I thought early on was that the one girl did incredibly stupid things when they arrived in Paris: giving a bunch of information to a stranger. This is only the second time that I\'ve heard Albanian spoken (the first was in The Inside Man, in which I learned how to pronounce Enver Hoxha\'s surname). Anyway, this Taken isn\'t the movie that I would recommend above all others, but it\'s OK for the length that it runs. Also starring Famke Janssen.'""
""Outstanding and high octane action. Be ready for an elevated heart-rate and possible blood sugar spike. No matter what role Liam Neeson takes you can pretty well count on getting more than your buck's worth. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former super-spy with remarkable skills. His estranged teenage daughter Kim(Maggie Grace)and her friend Amanda(Katie Cassidy)are in Europe following the band U2 on tour. In Paris, the two girls are kidnapped for entry into the sex slave trade. Mills will rely on the full extent of his special skills to track down the abductors and conduct a one-man war with the purpose of rescuing his daughter and applying furious vengeance on the ruthless gang of kidnappers.Suspense is high. Violence is swift and without mercy. Adrenaline has your heart bouncing against your Adam's apple. TAKEN is highly recommended. Also in the cast: Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Leland Orser, Arben Bajraktaraj and Holly Valance.""
""'This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.Taken has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it\'s full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. Taken is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced.'""
""Sordid goods in a glossy package. Crime-drama from director Curtis Hanson concerning police corruption and murder in 1953 Los Angeles is, much like its scenario, seamy stuff underneath a classy veneer. Kevin Spacey is the narcotics officer, Russell Crowe the investigating officer, Guy Pierce the new lieutenant, Danny DeVito well-cast as the gossip columnist, and Kim Basinger the hooker whose bosses figure in the crime spree and drug-trafficking. Overstuffed, overwrought, with nasty sideline details detracting from the intense narrative of cops-gone-bad. The picture certainly looks good, and keeps its momentum up despite a byzantine plot that becomes harder and harder to follow. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar; the screenplay also copped statues for Hanson and Brian Helgeland, who based their script on James Ellroy's novel. The movie has punch--but doles it out in spurts. The first hour is best, and most of the ensemble acting is spot-on, but interest wanes once the story becomes too muddied up. **1/2 from ****""
""This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichÃÂ©d. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.""
""'The movie gives you some quick backgrounds on 4 of the characters, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The rest you have to guess at. And if you are like me, and have never read the comics, you are clueless and sit back and enjoy all the women in lingerie. It boils down to a good vs. evil scenario, which I can understand.The good guys create a machine that will locate other mutants. Charles is able to cleverly locate all the mutants during a single music montage. Meanwhile Kevin Bacon wants to start an all out nuclear war so the radiation will kill all the humans and only leave the mutants. This is remake of the history of the Cuban missile crisis.As always, great special effects. Background knowledge of the characters and other movies would be a plus, such as cameo by Hugh Jackman or Rebecca Romijn, but not necessary to enjoy the film.The nuclear reactor controls on the submarine were totally bogus for any era. Favorite line: I have been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.F-bomb (thanks Hugh for the F.O.) sexual situations and Avatar nudity. Excellent prequel.'""
""A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch).""
""'During the Cold War, Magneto joins Xavier in an effort to stop Sebastian Shaw. This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn\'t need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn\'t establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It\'s unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It\'s brutal at times, with Lensherr\'s quest for revenge. This isn\'t really action as much as thriller, and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I\'ve seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10'""
""'Well tonight is Oscar night as I write this, and this picture will likely garner it\'s share of awards. It deserves it\'s accolades, but I have to say, it\'s tough picture to watch at times. The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in The Passion of the Christ, I have to wonder if any person\'s human body can stand up to that type of torture. It\'s too graphic even for words, and rending another person\'s flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it\'s horror, and in today\'s politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it\'s own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong\'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it\'s horrors. Again, a tough picture to watch, but probably an important one if it helps bridge the atrocities of a past century with healing instead of divisiveness.'""

There are dozens of better movies, and even Donnie Brasco is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichÃÂ©s and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar.

Kudos to Jane Goldman for writing it and Matthew Vaughn (whose LAYER CAKE I hated) for directing.The jokes come thick and fast, most of them funny. Aaron Johnson is a delightful as the ineffectual superhero, but the real star is Chloe Moretz, whose Hit Girl is probably the most original character in a film all year. What a surprise, too, to find Nicolas Cage so hilarious, with his deadpanned impression of Adam West's BATMAN another highlight. The plot moves along at a fair old whack and is loaded with delicious action and outrageous profanity. The CCTV footage showing Big Daddy tackling a warehouse full of thugs was wonderful. Mark Strong makes for another charismatic bad guy, but I'd like to start seeing him playing the hero once in a while. Vaughn can't help including roles for his old buddies like Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, but there's no harm in that either. What a breath of fresh air this movie is.""
""So this is what won the Oscar for Best Picture. The days of something like Titanic winning the award seems long gone now. Then again, most of what's popular are usually some special effects-epic that doesn't say anything particularly important, just meant to entertain for a couple hours. And that includes many superhero pictures that are permeating the industry right now. Michael Keaton plays an actor who once was part of that crowd when he was Birdman. Now he's trying to be legitimate again by starring and directing himself in a play based on a Raymond Carver story. Shot in what seems like one continuous take, this film is a compelling take on art vs. commerce, realism vs. simple playacting, and sanity vs. insanity. Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and others do fine performances on how some actors cope with whatever insecurities they have when things don't always happen like they think they should.

Mike is a method actor who gets on Riggan's nerves.The concept of long continuous scenes is interesting. It adds to the level of difficulty. It is audacious and makes the audience sit up to pay attention. Although this movie does not take place in real time. It's not 2 hours of Riggan's life. There is one amazing scene with Keaton in his underwear. There is a daring in that it is outside in the real world. It adds a higher level of energy and that scene buzzes. The standout performance is Norton. He's got the most fun character. Everybody does a great job especially Galifianakis, Stone and of course Keaton.""
""Despite the phenomenal acting of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, this film brings a new definition to the word quirky. It deals with a has-been movie actor attempting a comeback via a Broadway production.It seems that the cast is normal when they act out the play on stage and then revert to all sorts of bizarre behavior, neurotic behavior and other nonsense in the dressing rooms of the theater they are performing at.It goes to show the frustration of acting and alter egos taking over. It is also shows the power of critics, in this case, the woman critic who though she hasn't seen the play, plans to demolish it with a scathing review, as she feels that Keaton and his brew lack artistic talent.The ending is sad, but in life, such things can very well happen, especially when we are dealing with neurotic characters.

Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America. The trip is barely under way when the old geezer discovers he has a stowaway...8 year old Russell(Jordan Nagai), a chubby wilderness explorer trying to earn his final patch. Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog.""

Unfortunately after seeing it a few more times since then I notice it`s become a victim of its own success . By that I mean every single British film released between 1999 and 2002 seemed to be about gangsters in one form or another carrying out a scam against a funky soundtrack in an inferior retread of LSATSB . In fact Guy Ritchie isn`t below plagerising himself with SNATCH which was basically the same film stylewise . But this was the original and best of the Brit gangster new wave. Brilliantly written in a sharp bleakly comical style with some mind bending cinematography by Tim Maurice Jones . There is some criticism that the acting is a bit wooden but I guess that`s deliberate on the part of Ritchie so that the dialogue comes to the fore . And what great lines the characters have , especially Rory`s  Do you understand Nicholas ? Good cos if you don`t I`ll kill ya  speech .BTW this film cost less than one million pounds to make .

""For awhile The Walking Dead was one of my favorite shows until season 7 and 8 as of recently I got back to it and forgot how enjoyable it is a lot of the time. The series has some of the most exciting, emotional, and devastating bits that are kinda necessary more than most shows ever! The cast is excellent, writing has ups/ downs, even a fair amount of comedy, so much of it all I love! It's weird the way the direction plays out throughout the coarse of the series kinda like Supernatural was for me I'll be happy when it's over. I'm sorry about my review the show has gone down hill and wanted to be honest about it.""
""Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.""
""The Walking Dead, up until after the Season 7 premiere, was a show that I looked forward to every week. It was a really well done drama with great performances from the whole cast, walkers included. This did not just apply to a handful of the main cast because some great characters came and went. Every time we lost a good character, we most often were introduced to a just as good if not better character. Not only that, but it was faithful to the themes of the comic books. The only downside was the quality of the CGI effects, but that's understandable seeing as how it is a cable show and probably does not have the same budget as say Game of Thrones. However, this doesn't detract too much from the show. After the season 7 premiere, the show began to falter. The story arcs seemed way to stretched out of the point where a good half of the episodes were filler and it seemed like it lost its worrysome sense that anyone could go at anytime. However, Season 9 brought the show back to its roots in a sense. That danger became a reality once again and the episodes no longer felt like filler. If they keep up with this, the show could regain its footing it once had a few seasons prior.""
""'Brilliant show for the first 2 seasons. I can recall a time when I couldn\'t wait for Sunday nights to see the further exploits of my favorite fictional made man Tony Soprano and his interaction with his family and his job trying to balance the two.

It was never the same, I kept watching and hoping though. Season 3 was just alright nothing compared to the first 2 amazing seasons. Season 4 I choose to stop watching about three quarters of the way through. It was awful soap opera BS. They turned one of my favorite shows sour. Gold had been turned into manure.

""'it is a great show. not only for acting or script but for the high respect for measure. the humor, the cruelty, the sarcasm, the family life and the justice are pieces of precise puzzle. and that is the secret for its science to be not only realistic, not successful or seductive but itself. the courage to present a delicate subject in right manner is the best thing. and the detail who transforms it in a series -mirror for society sins. film about vulnerabilities of strong men, it has the rare science to use the actors gifts in subtle manner. and that is the source of a touching, impressive story about the life and death.'""
""'I can\'t believe that it took me this long to get around to seeing The Sopranos. I had heard a lot about it, but I can affirm that with this show, Six Feet Under and Game of Thrones, HBO revolutionized TV in the 21st century. A gritty look at a mob boss and how he tries to balance his work life and family, this show pulls no punches. One of the points that it makes is that there aren\'t really any good or bad characters. People do what they think best serves the family.I don\'t know if I would go so far as to call it the greatest show ever - my personal fave of HBO\'s series is Six Feet Under - but the writing, acting and direction combine to make something that you won\'t get on the networks or basic cable. If you want to understand some of the best that TV can provide, then you owe it to yourself to watch The Sopranos. Great show.Too bad that James Gandolfini, Nancy Marchand and the recently deceased Frank Vincent are no longer with us.'""

""If this season six is a parody on the genre of clichÃÂ©d/trite hauntings from wronged past inhabitants who once lived in a rundown New England (or thereabouts) mansion followed by unexplained disappearances & murders with ghostly images, closing doors, things falling/flying and oftentimes filmed using the shaky camera redux technique then I give it three stars. Because, it had all that. Furthermore, it also had the overused shaky camera horror interviews of those who survived (or maybe didn't, but a filmed archive did), and even a shaky camera film crew meeting their demises from the ephemeral inhabitants. Otherwise, too much time spent on talking heads and everything else predictable.""

""'Seinfeld has inserted relevant phrases, words, characters, situations into pop culture and American way of living. No kidding. This sitcom is a highlight in 90\'s culture.I\'m not exaggerating when saying that the situations in Seinfeld are seriously taken from real life but only in a funnier way. There\'s humor for all tastes: we get black humor, plenty of sarcasm, laughing at yourself (come on, you can be identified with ANY of the 4 lead characters), double sense, sexual humor, scatological jokes, and more.I enjoyed every single character. The guest appearances added that extra something that sitcoms need. But you never get tired of Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, or George. All of them have elements from any person with a regular life. Heck, when something in the likes of Murphy\'s Law happens to me in real life, then I immediately think about Seinfeld.What I\'m trying to say is that this is a very important t.v. show. It set the rules for situation comedies, sarcasm, and more. I have thanked this series for making my life better, happier. I always laugh out loud no matter what episode is. This is definitely the best and funnier sitcom ever. No doubt about it. Forget about the 80\'s corny humor and moral messages; the 90\'s unique humor will survive the course of time. If nothing means hilarious, then I\'m demented because I laugh everyday with this!'""

""I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox.""
""'a sitcom about nothing. it is the first definition. and it seems be the best. because it is only a series of scenes, situations, dark/bitter/absurd humor. and nothing more. a stand up comedian, his family and friends and neighbors, his girlfriends, his crisis, his falls. all in a strange game. but Seinfeld has a small virtue - it is a honest story about life. ordinary life. the life of every day. the life around bizarre people, not comfortable job, the life of errors and mistakes, illusions and need to escape from yours circle. each character is a part from the others, like in the case of Matryoshka dolls. and this fact does Seinfeld unique.'""
'I like the bit where Jerry says funny things before and after the acting bits'
""The beginning season were amazing!! Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.""
""I started watching Greys Anatomy in Season 4 and I liked it. Its focues on Doctors in Seattle who do different operations in every show and they also have steamy sex with their loved ones. Patrick Dempsey in this is so obnoxious in this programme I swear to god he goes on and on about how wonderful he is and that the bloody hospital is in fact his. Grr I hate Dr Shepard but I adore Dempsey though as he is sexy and very respectable. The charcthers are OK,the procedures they do in this programme is sometimes gross e.g one of them had a pencil stuck in their eye,opening up people's stomachs.I liked the season 6 finale in Grey's as Dr Shepard gets shot by some guy who wanted revenge as his wife died in the hospital and he bought a gun and shot some of the staff along with Dr Shepard. I was like NO!!.Its a great show and I liked it even though I never saw the season 1 of it.""
""I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother. Anyway, it has become Ally McBeal meets ER now rather than St. Elsewhere.""
""'I admittedly stopped watching this show in season 10, but feel I invested enough time to still leave a review. This show started out so good, well developed characters, heart wrenching storylines... but once the main characters started to leave, the show was over. But Ellen Pompeo continues to drag this show through the battlefield of fallen characters, every natural disaster you can think of, and every hairbrained medical mishaps on this planet and the next.'""
""Literally and metaphorically speaking. It's the most disjointed show I know, quality wise. The first round (season 1 to 4) only had two great seasons, 2 and 3. The second (season 5 to 8) is so boring around the second half of season 7, you wonder why bother watching the 8th. Fortunately proving you wrong, when you do, because it's one of the best the show's ever had, with 6 and 3, so far. Adding season 2 and 5 as my personal pick. Then part three (from season 9 to 11) is where the quality and genuineness, left the hospital. I even consider season 11 finale last shot to bring the series closure. And the following season to be part of a different chapter, for die hard fans only. Which I'm clearly not, because from season 12 onward, I stopped following it on TV, and only watch episodes whenever I felt like it, or curious about the music placements (which is without a doubt, one of the highlights of the whole series). I can't really blame the acting, it's good overall. But the writing got extremely ridiculous and repetitive after a while. Pushing more commonplaces and other biases, ÃÂ« narrow minded ÃÂ» people like me hate so much... All in all, it's a good medical drama, that often leans towards soap opera territory at more than one occasion. But it didn't age well, both in the way it picks subjects and characters to focus on.""
""Definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. I don't think I ever saw a better one. At least I can't remember a better one. I write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. That's says it all. The acting is excellent. There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. And don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. Never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything. I'm a devoted fan, so devoted I already have three tattoos about it. House Targayen rules!""
""'I understand that George R. R. Martin based A Song of Ice and Fire on various and sundry wars and conquests throughout Europe\'s history. Indeed, the characters on Game of Thrones seem to have no aim except to fight for control of Westeros. It is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.I should note that this show is not for children. It\'s one of the most violent shows that I\'ve ever seen. Seriously, they leave little to the imagination. I\'ve never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn\'t dumb anything down (understanding of course that it\'s fantasy).Having just binge-watched the first season, I recommend the show. Really impressive.'""
""This is a television drama series starring Damian Lewis as an ambitious hedge fund king and Paul Giamatti as a relentless and tough U.S. Attorney.Just saw the (unaired) pilot and it is more than obvious that this series is designed to impress. There is a slow building of the set-up. Bit by Bit of information until you get the whole picture of what is happening and the connection between the main characters. Unfortunately is that connection that makes me hold a small basket. The relation between the characters is stronger than it first appear and makes it a borderline soap opera. I really hope it doesn't get into one.Anyway, you have some credible actors, you get to see glimpses on how the upper 1% of the world lives (which is always a selling point since Dallas and Dynasty) plus you may learn a couple of things about the stock-market and funds and other ...mystical things that most people don't know about and could make a guy billionaire in a day or so.Overall: Nothing spectacular so far, but the set-up of the pilot made clear what you are about to see in the 12 episodes of the 1st season. 2 men (yet not 2 different worlds) will collide in a pissing contest (as it is clearly said in the pilot). Who will win? Only one way to find out...""
""'I know popcorn-epics like Spider-Man can\'t dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with \'bigger and better\' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****'""
""'What begins as a standoff between two authority figures in a dramatic setting turns, as the seasons go by, to satire, comedy and lastly into a morbid pastiche showcasing master class motivation and morality.In doing so it should lose credibility as series but instead ends up looking more and more like the real world in which we live in. Turns out the joke is on the rest of us.'""
""'Had they toned down the sarcasm, and flip attitude, this might have been watchable. I tried hard to get through the first season, but the incessant attempts to be humorous were brittle, not funny, and wore me out. It took the fun out of what was a great premise, and though I love this genre, I could not get past episode four.Also, the woman lead was a bit too me too. She had zero connection with her femininity, and way too much shame about appearing semi nude in a show that took place years ago. She was essentially playing a good looking man.This could have been so much better.'""

""Lucifer is a great show, a lot of it is the charming and amusing devil we all love to see. The strength of this show is the balance it strikes between the detective work and the biblical/divine elements. The greatest punch is delivered when one drives the other. Lucifer made a strong start and I think the first seasons were it's best. Low points include too much of the detective work and less biblical elements, it then resembles CSI more and more. You don't want another detective show. Less time should also be devoted to side characters like Maze. They are often used as space fillers for no good reason, characters should appear when needed.

Worse still, its simply, in many respects, a blatant re-hash of what went before.Like Star Wars, this feels like making something for the sake of making it.

He deserved to be killed after all the horrible things he did. My biggest question is, why would he keep the locations of his victims' bodies a secret for so long? How could he not just tell them and let their families bury them and have closure? He kept everyone in so much pain.Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. 10 out of 10 stars. Two Thumbs Way Up!""
""'An investigative team within NCIS solve US Navy based crime. Like procedurals such as CSI there\'s lab work, morgue pathology scenes and field work with gun-wielding ex-marines and agents. There\'s humour, heart, good plots and silly one-liners. Often the cases can be dangerous with suspense, gory bits and emotional scenes where their private life issues impact on work. There are great, varied characters from the goth vampy science lab-rat Abby (Pauley Perrette), British Pathologist Ducky (David McCullum), wise-cracker playboy DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) lead by their commander Gibbs (Mark Harmon) to, in some of the series, the fabulous tough-gal ex-Mossad agent Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) who all bring various aspects to the stories.Like all procedurals, there are some jumps of supposition, and like all similar American programs it\'s a bit formulaic, and can be silly and predictable, with some cheese, but it\'s great television, very watchable and the cases - being military - are slightly different from the normal city-cop version of this sort of program you usually get. It\'s an enjoyable watch with something for everyone. Easily the best US murder/investigative procedural on TV at present.'""
""I guess years ago I watched; I put up with more and would watch a slow 4 star. And early on, it wasn't as repetitious. Barely entertaining. boring, bad acting. I didn't like the characters and the plot lines were mundane. The thing I hated most, was Mark Harmon as the wise kind father figure, who protects and likes women. Having met him once, before NCIS, I was offended in a very casual exchange. Michael now has a spin off, always seemed way too full of himself. OK, he was a model. Reading some on set problems, with Pauly speaking out about being terrorized, and what happened to Cote, forced to leave? They were too popular. And others with both Mark and Michael on his set, I see my perceptions of them were correct. Now, you can say who they are shouldn't influence how I perceive their performances. but who they are showed in their performances. Smug. Neither are the best actors. I thought People's sexy man of the year for Mark Harmon years ago was laughable. I do think, it is fair to look at an actor, and say, I don't like you, as an actor and for what you've done.\nBeside that, the story lines and characters are just boring. Sure. it's hard to get a new spin on an old theme. But that's no excuse.""
""'...but Fight Club is much more intriguing in its smaller moments, where it finds a surreal, dream-like quality that seems to snake around at will.

The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well.

""At first I thought who needs to see all this again but once I started watching it I was hooked. The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.The A list cast is hit and miss. Cuba Gooding is an enthusiastic actor but too small in size to play OJ. He looks shorter than the other male actors around him. Should have chosen someone more physically imposing. Sarah Paulson looks enough like Marcia Clark with the wig. Surprisingly David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian looks like him if you check out photos. John Travolta as Shapiro has some strange eyebrows but he is fascinating to watch. Selma Blair as Kris Kardashian is also a good fit. Connie Britton looks a bit too healthy to be Faye Resnick but these are all people you like to see on screen. The link with the Kardashians is quite interesting to watch.Well done and very voyeuristic and entertaining.""

In addition to giving a sense of how weird the rich Angeleno culture is, it makes clear that you couldn\'t separate race from the trial. Having watched the verdict read on TV back when it happened, I know how charged the atmosphere was. This has become all the more relevant since George Floyd\'s murder.I understand that season two focuses on Gianni Versace\'s murder, and how you couldn\'t separate homophobia from the story. Without a doubt, our country has a lot of issues to deal with.The point is, this is a show that draws you in, even if you know the story. I recommend it.'""
""When it comes to cutting edge dramas, no one does it well like FX. The first entry in the American Crime Story series, the People vs. OJ Simpson, recreates the moments when OJ fled the scene of a murder in one of the most popular crime stories of all time. There are some changes to make it different from real life, but the casting is well done and the way its shot is good. The music and soundtrack is well done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty good as OJ. I'm sure FX will do good with the story based on Hurricane Katrina and its impact on America.

If you grew up in the 80\'s as I did or enjoy sci-fi/horror, I recommend checking this out.'""
""'Since its debut last year, Netflix\'s Stranger Things has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will\'s disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there\'s the contrast between Will\'s family and Mike\'s family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn\'t disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will\'s distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her cute roles, then you\'re in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.And remember, the bad men are coming.*I understand that the show\'s creators tracked down the makers of the era\'s board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries.'""

""'Like The Sixth Sense, this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can\'t say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt\'s character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton\'s narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter\'s role in here. I couldn\'t take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that nasty seems to be so appealing to kids these days.'""

""I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better.""
""'This is one of those top of the league series. Once you start watching you can\'t stop it. My wife and I were completely hooked on this series. Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can\'t do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If Better Call Saul is in the same way then it can\'t go wrong. Anyways, Breaking Bad is a must-see if you never saw it.'""
""'This show is plain out memorable and one of the shows that should not be missed. It revolves around greed, revenge and redemption. These elements has been portrayed in other shows before. But not as articulately, intricately and meticulously done as this show (or at least I have seen so far). This show boosted Bryan Cranston career and popularity for good reason. Walter White aka Heisenberg has become one of the most iconic television characters. Some show has a first season that is good and starts to go downhill from there. This is a show that has a good first season and it keeps getting better and better until the grand finale, with a exquisitely stand out ending. It\'s like Vince Gilligan the creator of the show planned just about the main jist of the story when it comes to the 5 season all out from the beginning. With it\'s high adrenaline build up that build and builds while staying consistent and relevant through out the whole thing. With the chemistry between characters and transformation, thus the title Breaking Bad. This is a show I would recommend people to stick through few episodes and there is a high chance that it will hook them. This show is a downright great mix of serious drama and comedy. Overall without giving anything much away, this is a well written show with great character developments that is worth checking out.9.3/10'""
""Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV.""
'I don\'t need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don\'t know already that if you go to talk to the investigators that you don\'t just say I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer. And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent.'
""for me,this is the best of the Law and Order Franchise.i really like the good mix of characters.they are well written and defined and the show goes in depth with them,both in their professional and personal lives.the show is also very edgy,and dark.it pushes the envelope.plus,there's more action than the original Law and Order,and Law and Order:Criminal Intent.i find the original Law and Order to be more of a procedural drama,so it's more about the drama.as for Law and Order:Criminal Intent,i find it lacks the edge of SVU.both of those other shows have their merits,but for me,Law and Order:Special Victims Unit is the best of the bunch.""

As he threatens to release them, an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) who appears to have lost a step, must go to Shanghai and appear in the obligatory casino scene and attempt to get back the computer file. This feature has the standard Bond lines, killer title track, sensual scenes, over the top chase action, as well as a return to Bond\'s roots.Judi Dench as M was superb. Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn\'t need anyone but himself. Worth a peek on the big screen.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, sensual scenes that implied sex, no nudity.'""
""'I don\'t really have anything to say; read George Orwell\'s essay on No Orchids for Miss Blandish and discover why it\'s all been said before, better than I could say it.Obviously the show is cruddy enough on aesthetic grounds: I don\'t know whether to blame the wooden acting or the 100%-exposition dialogue, so let\'s blame both. But people are willing to overlook such things on TV in the interests of fantasy. I am too. What\'s depressing is that people are willing to overlook the lousiness of the production in the interests of what they\'re really getting out of the show: the chance to watch the hounds chase the fox for an hour, until the latter collapses of exhaustion.What\'s also depressing is that this show is part of a trend. In the past, a leading-up-to-the-trial kind of TV show would have focused on the defence lawyers; it\'s a shame that we\'re now getting a kick out of siding with the prosecution, especially when it\'s this bunch of deeply unpleasant people.Perry Mason didn\'t have a mean streak.'""

""'I probably should give this show more of a chance, but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it, I probably won\'t watch it again. Most of the time, British comedies, when taken over by Americans, don\'t seem to make it. Fawlty Towers, which lasted all of five minutes, comes to mind. This appears to be one of them. There were some very funny moments, and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version.The boss, plain and simple, is a complete moron. Totally out of it, he thinks he\'s a role model and hilariously funny, when all the while he\'s a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks, does Three Stooges impressions, and is emotionally abusive (firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears). It\'s a great setup for a fabulous character, but I found him only annoying.I\'m afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp\'s: embarrassed, appalled, and not finding much funny.'""
""The Office regardless of the British version is probably one of the best comedies out there. Steve Carrell is a comic genius and I remember him from his days at the Daily Show on Comedy Central. The other cast members are really unknown. They look like office workers that you and I work beside five days a week. His character of Michael Scott is purely genius. This guy is somebody we all know who thinks he's all that and a bag of chips but he's not. The characters in the Office do need to be more clear. They are all rather vague so far to me. Sometimes, I don't know who is which but I can tell you something. This show makes me want to watch it again because I work in an office and I have colleagues like them too. When they were standing outside during a fire, it was interesting to see that a simple fire like a toaster burning because the new temp and business school college student left something there in the wrong spot. They made the experience watchable and interesting to see who would do who on a desert island much like Lost and what movies they would see. I bet there are people who have the same movies on their list too. Long live the Office.""
""How willing would you be to eat nothing but bitter tasting spoiled food just to say you did it? Watching this series reminded me of that.

The usual artificial, not real, characterizations including girl's night out partying, drinking & talking hook-ups. Lot's of famous author's name dropping for some reason. Stalker able to avoid the most obvious forensic detective investigations (actually none) to continue the series. Victims, of course, are less than perfect humans so the sympathy angle is out.""

In my opinion you take a moment to get to know all of the characters better and understand the special dynamic within the cast. But once you\'ve grown attached to them, you will soon notice how brilliantly producers managed to create a balance between episodal plots, steady characters and more serious moments, thus enabling a scenerie that never gets boring and gives you both surprising moments and a feeling of community with the characters. Surely there are more subtle and clever comedy shows, but it is refreshing to see that it is possible to create something this funny without relying on sophisticated approaches and the like.All in all I am looking forward to the episodes yet to come and meanwhile encourage anyone to do a binge-watching session and explore the potential of this extraordinary show.'""

When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King\'s disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film.

""Supernatural was the reigning king of entertainment during it's first five seasons by mixing different cultures and human driven stories together like a melting pot.Despite the lackluster plot, the mystery of what caused to two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, mother to die in a firey blaze hooked a large audience right away and helped the new CW show to soar to heights not seen before.It was intelligently written, had clever villains that could outwit the leads in the brains department and out up a good fight instead of making them an untouchable superman ahead of the game.They had to use research, skull and think of new ways to defeat the for keeping it refreshing.Having a sibling myself, it was nice to see the schisms and talks the brothers had after a hard day. It brought it down to a personal level of what defines and makes a family. A theme that resonates several times on the show all the way back to Cain and Abel to the apocalyptic fight between Michael and Lucifer.The humor is prevalent throughout when the boys use fake ids to Cain access to crime scenes, unintended sexual situations or their Angel friend Cas tries to understand how humanity ticks.The atmosphere was wonderful adding to the eerie campfire stories they were telling.While the show has gone down in quality in recent years there is still a spark left lit to enjoy.""

""I still don't know what the hoopla is all about with this series. It's a costume drama set in 1912 in fictional Downton Abbey where there are plenty of servants and an aristocratic family. The cast is first rate led by Dame Maggie Smith among others. She is a scene stealer. The costumes, art direction, and sets are first rate. I have seen other British dramas with costumes and sets. This drama doesn't seem much different and I'm surprised by its success. I believe class differences between servants and the family to which they serve is considerable. The servants can be cutthroat and vicious. Just look at poor Bates in the first episode. There is plenty of drama going on in the servants quarters while their employers worry about their futures of their three daughters where marriage is the only answer.""

But Gosford Park wrestled with matters of substance, and showcased some striking film technique.This show is teeming with decent characters (translation: progressive) none of whom could have existed historically, and none of whom can inject the show with any surprises. The show shoots the bolt in the first two episodes where Lord Grantham defends and acts as co-equals with two different servants. Hooray for time-traveling with anachronistic values. The show never rises above soap opera by larding itself down with drippy conflicts, and boatloads of shallow female matters. The elevated estrogen level torpedoes any real intrigue.The drama in this is just so much sniveling.'""
""'One may not think that a show centered around stuffy British aristocrats and the legion of butlers, maids, cooks, footmen, and valets who serve them would make for riveting drama.

Downton Abby proved that a humble network like PBS can compete with the titans of the TV landscape. Downton Abbey is the embodiment of excellence.

""Everything about this show is good, really good.The story lines are clever and believable and the characters are perfect.Thomas Gibson is brilliant and holds the whole team together as Aaron Hotchner and Joe Mantegna as David Rossi is another great character.But then there is the amazingly good Matthew Gray Gubler as the weird and wonderful Dr. Spencer Reid and Shemar Moore as Derek Morgan shows that a black man can have a major part that isn't as a black man ( so many films stereo type black actors and this is a refreshing change)Jennifer Jareau played by A.J Cook is another well rounded character but then there is the brilliant Kirsten Vangsness as Penelope Garcia I miss Mandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon as his character was a lynch pin for the early episodes.The only character I didn't really like was Erin Strauss played by Jayne Atkinson. I felt that those episodes were more like a soap opera and Criminal minds was better than that.So pleased that this show is continuing and look forward to many more.""

""I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all. It's not easy, but he knows what he's doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen""
'I don\'t need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don\'t know already that if you go to talk to the investigators that you don\'t just say I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer. And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent.'
Every time this show is on TV I cringe. The writing sucks. The acting sucks. Nothing is believable. It's violent in a bad way. Everyone in the show looks bored. It's just a horrible TV procedural. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.

""'Hugh Campbell, bereaved after his girlfriend is carelessly shredded by superhero speedster A-Train, falls in with Billy Butcher who regards it as his role in life to hold superheroes, and their mentoring organisation Vought, accountable for their actions.I have just binged series 1 and 2. I am a long-time fan of Garth Ennis\' savagely deconstructionist comic, on which this TV series is based. I am self-aware enough to recognise that part of my enjoyment comes from its base appeal - the sex, bad language, disgusting behaviour and extreme violence are all part of the appeal, although the genuine humanity, compassion, and emotional heart are equally important.The TV series captures all this. The broad story arc remains the same although much of the detail differs significantly enough that you never know what\'s coming next, which keeps the series fresh. All the cast members are excellent. Karl Urban enjoys playing Butcher, whose outward good humour covers seething anger. But towering over everything is Antony Starr\'s Homelander, a Superman equivalent whose square-jawed posturing disappears the minute the cameras are turned off, to be replaced by an arrogant disregard for everyone else. The power of Starr\'s performance derives from the fact that he also makes us see a damaged and partly sympathetic child within the monster.Beware - this is not a superhero series for children. The sex is frank, the violence is graphic, and the language is eye-wateringly foul and constant.'""

'I finally got to see this as it\'s running on Prime and am surprised at its popularity. The opening scene featuring slashing swords and a body littered battleground which was as devoid of real blood and gore as was the A-Team series . And there isn\'t a lot here with plot either: Ragnar wants to find the fabled English Coast so he can kill monks or whoever he finds and add to the Viking hoard of loot whereas the Earl says no. So Ragnar sails off anyway and upsets the status quo. As hokey as it was I found the Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas film The Vikings at least a hoot.

There is not a thrilling drama or an exciting action movie. This is simply art and nothing less. Director Stanley Kubrick is impeccable in his vision. It imparts a mood of foreboding.

They had a purpose to find who killed Jason, Betty being a highschool girl etc. It also had it bad moments but I was fine with that. Then came season 2 and slowly the series began to crash. I didn't know if it could go further bad after watching the final episodes of season 2. Then came season 3 with more bad writing and bad moments. The 21st episode gave me a small hope though as they slowly unveiled the mysteries. But the final episode just was the same old Riverdale which sucks. I don't know what they are going to do in season 4 but still going to watch.""
""I'm stunned by just how many episodes they've managed to churn out, talk about over egging the pudding.

""An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, LÃÂ©on (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardÃÂSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with LÃÂ©on rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is LÃÂ©on's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from LÃÂ©on. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.""

""'I tried to like The Big Bang Theory. I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.For me, the biggest problem from The Big Bang Theory (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichÃÂ©s, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the nerd archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film Revenge of the Nerds.All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.I consider The Big Bang Theory  to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be cool and edgy by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.So, in other words, The Big Bang Theory is the (stereotypically) nerd version of Friends.'""
""When The Big Bang Theory premiered three years ago, I was certainly skeptical since it came from the creators of Two and A Half-Men (one of the worst comedies on TV ever). However, since then, it has proved to be one of the best comedies on Television.The ensemble cast is amazing, quite amazing in every way. Johnny Galecki is a true comedy lead star, and Kaley Cuoco has gotten better since her 8 Simple Rules days. However, as great as the cast is, the shining star here is Jim Parsons. He has created one of the funniest, most obscure and interesting characters I have ever seen in a sitcom, thanks in large part to the writing and to his magnificent portrayal. It is evident that he holds the show together.Overall, this is a very likable comedy series, that while it started off so-so, has gotten better and better and has proved it's greatness over the years.""
""Having watched all the seasons, here's my final review of the show:\nHad to change my rating from 10 to 8, because I've rated this one with 10 back when the show had three seasons and the final ones were really disappointing. So, sometimes, you had to keep watching because you loved the characters and the series had grown on you.\nOverall, the show is one of the best comedies out there and a classic for sure. The first seasons were pure gold, funny, fresh and entertaining. The last ones slowed things down and focused more on the characters stories, although they were funny too.\nFinal thoughts: A must see, as it doesn't stray from the original idea, even if the characters changed overtime.""
""How the hell does this show gets an 8.6 rating on IMDb? Am i completely missing the point or what? Without bragging about myself I'm normally known by my friends to have a great sense of humor but this series is just so dumb with almost nothing humorous in it. The characters are so lame and they are actually not even good actors. Almost every character in this series is annoying. You kind of feel the urge to slap them in the face after every line they speak. And the most horrible part of the show is the laugh track. After every single phrase they speak you are apparently obliged to laugh. Well I only laugh or smile when it's funny, I never do on command. And in this show I hardly never laugh because it's just not funny at all. This show is an insult to other comedies.""
""'It is easy to praise the father-daughter relationship that Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) display in this dark and compelling film, but I feel that would be superficial.The relationship appeared to be much deeper - almost sexual - as the two tried to find some meaning in their lives.Leon was just slouching through life doing his job and not caring about much else. A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda. Reno and Portman were brilliant and aptly supported by Oldman and Danny Aiello.'""

Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, The Wire is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting.

The Wire with its thoughtful and tense dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I've seen, the stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and unforgettable.

Then the episode 'The girl in the fire place' was very dark and scary; it really shows how much a good script can do. The show has some great episodes and good villains; Tennant does the role justice even though he seems at times, over-acting...But as the series goes on it seems that Russel.T.Davies is trying to make the show into something like 'Buffy'; which I happen to be a very big fan of...and Davies fails.And it seems that bits of the show are pieces of Hollywood movies...Overall this is a good show but is let down by some of the plots; and acting.""

Even so, the last two television series even though based on magic - resonated even more directly with life in the contemporary world and The Lost Room (2006 TV) and Defying Gravity (2009 TV) were focused compelling sci fi drama, whereas Dr. Who seems to spiral its audience into fantasy of far away places even as it sometimes deals with our world at home, albeit United Kingdom, mostly.""

I never knew about the Witcher until I saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season. Not a bad performance and Yennefer and Geralt are the primary characters. Henry Cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done. There is one dragon, and it's nothing like the beasts from GOT. This dragon is more like a cousin of Smaug, and the more classical dragons. Well worth watching.""
""The WitcherI loved it!In many way this series was a bit of a mess, the box set skipped around, half the time we had no clue what this or that meant, and the whole thing lacked cohesiveness, whether this was entirely intentional I would think not. However by the end of the series we were less confused and there were some elements that created better connection. In summation this was not easy viewing.Whoever did the casting was inspired, we had in the main seasoned pros, this well upped the whole series. Henry Cavill was perfect for the role and a master of the aside, the deadpan humour and a good deal of comic timing.There were so many good things here we were spoilt, it does need to raise itself before it becomes mired in teenage angst or to many special effects, it is the strength of story and dramatic impetus that will make this show stand out.If someone is truly evil make them so no half measures.I just can't wait for series 2, I want it now......!""
""When you're blessed with that kind of alluring beauty, you had better back it up with the talent as you put yourself out there. Without the audience's unquestionable addiction to her, this show (now going into a seventh season) is but a minor footnote in the crime drama genre. A lot of money is being spent in this production, but had they taken away the girl's designer clothes and hair and makeup artists, and had just given her a better script to work with.. her real talent would have the opportunity to shine through, and it might have had an increased chance at being a truly worthwhile series. Going through what will be 150 episodes plus is a lot for even the best of productions to withstand... praise the heavens in this instance for fast-forward streaming. PS.. so after eight seasons it falters to such a hurried uneventful demise... just as numerous real-life marriages do as well. Many felt it should have been given the hook long before. Will be interesting to see how-where they all rise from the ashes.""
""There are two distinctly different versions of this Film. The theatrical American release called The Professional and the International and Home Video cut titled Leon: The Professional or just Leon. The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer. It is an uncompromising and unconventional uncovering of some uncomfortable realities that are challenging as well as engaging. It is a Movie that can isolate many but also endear those willing to take on a bit more than usual.""
""I have liked this series from the beginning. I do have some gripes however. Why don't the characters call each other by their first names overall? Even after they get married Beckett and Castle call each other by their last names. I see this on other series. It is very annoying. They have been working together a long time. Enough already. Also, if you have attractive women let them dress to show off their looks. Stana Katic and Tamala Jones are very attractive, let them show it. This happens too infrequently. I think the mix of comedy and mystery is just right. Leave it as is. The other annoying point is Susan Sullivan's accent. It is extremely annoying. It is like closing my eyes and hearing Katherine Hepburn. I found her accent annoying even in short sentences. I remember her in a perry mason movies in the '80's or '90's. She did not have the accent then. Get rid of it. I like the series regardless of my gripes.""
""This show, perhaps my favorite, is a good blend of drama, comedy, wholesomeness, and romance. Castle, on the show, is a very prolific writer. (Maybe Fillon is too.) At the same time, he is a good father with that daughter of his. (Molly O'Quinn does a very good turn in the series.) And, of course, Susan Sullivan is a very appealing icon. Not only is Castle a good writer, but what would the NYPD do without him? Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic, is an unusually attractive lady very conscientious about her job. The plots of each episode keep the viewer wondering until almost the very last second: as a rule, you won't know the identity of the criminal till then. The comedy comes about when Castle and Beckett conduct persiflage with each other. Sometimes the jokes may be groaners, but you never tire from hearing them. What has always struck my attention...and this is nothing astounding...is whether or not they would ever have a lasting romance. I did like the last episode of the past season. A wonderful series. May it last forever.""
I would not be surprised if a survey of the regular watchers revealed that the guys watched it just for Stana Katic & the girls watched it just for Nathan Fillion.They were running a repeat of the first 6 seasons around these parts and I used to watch it every night at dinner time.They first season was good but then it started going downhill pretty fast. A back-story about Kate's mother that became more and more atrocious as the show dragged on. Saving the whole of New York simply by yanking all the wires on a massive bomb.......the list of stupidity is endless.The suspense in every show is the joke part. It would take a 12 year old around 5 minutes to predict who would be the culprit with 90% accuracy.This show must be right up there alongside Jersey Shore and Keeping up with the Kardashians.Terrible show aimed at people with limited thinking ability.Its amazing that it is still on. I would have thought that the studios would have pulled the plug a long long time ago.Everyone who has ever seen the show is a lesser human being for having seen this show.
""'Black Mirror is a trip to the what if realm......Unlike its title, the stories presented are not always dark and dystopian. Its a mixed bag, of cautionary, horror but also at times, genuinely uplifting and even moving, tales from the other side. The standard of storytelling, predictably, varies. Sometimes there is real flair and inspiration on offer. Other times, the tales can be rather unremarkable and occasionally, boring. That said, as a guide, I\'d say this series is more polished than not. Season three, sees a departure from UK only based episodes and offers up imaginings from the US as well. Its a good move, that works well, breaking up the UK centric feel of the show. I like Dark Mirror and hope for more in future. Seven out of ten from me.'""
""Charlie Brooker is a great satirist: funny and clever, and, although often crude, in 'Black Mirror' he certainly isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator (in spite of the fact that the first film is about the prime minister having sex with a pig!). Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart.""
""'The hype is real. \nI just finished all seasons (as of the date of this review seasons one to four). This show is great but far from amazing thanks to some oddball episodes that fall flat. The Christmas episode was outstanding and so was the one about the rating system. Templates for the future of mankind thanks to the evil corporations and satanic demons running Hollywood? Probably. Yeah, most of the world are all doomed because they are foolish enough not to see the warning signs. Meh, my work here is done and this review is over.'""
""It's one of the best series I've ever watched. There were excellent episodes, there were also good episodes. Sometimes it's bad :)""
""The series is generally beautiful, with all episodes disconnected you can watch what you want a little while skipping the episodes you don't like. In most of the series the tension is very high and the episodes are brilliant. There is some flaw that compromises the series a little but in general it is really nice.""
""One of those shows that was massively hyped when it started and now seems to exist quietly in the background, loved by only a few.For me it lacks total historical accuracy, the people playing the key figures never look anything like them, and it's all a bit soap opera-esque.""

""'Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by LÃÂ©on Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. LÃÂ©on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protÃÂ©gÃÂ©e and learns the assassin\'s trade.This is what you get if you take Lolita (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exerciseÃ¢ÂÂa slick urban thrillerÃ¢ÂÂit seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it. Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman\'s rising star.'""

""The show starts with a crashed jet on a deserted island. The survivors find the island is not so deserted and one of many mystery. On its surface, it is simply a scripted version of Survivor, the popular TV reality show. But as it develops, it shows itself to be much much more. The vast and varied cast is led by TV veteran Matthew Fox. They form a great family group of many individual skills. Their chemistry is truly compelling.This is J.J. Abrams' best creation of all of his many projects. The pilot is terrific and I love the first season as we follow the various characters. I don't want to give any spoilers. This is must-see TV.""
""Since the dawn of television, serialized series have been quite popular with audiences. It peaked when JR was shot nearly 40 years ago and has survived VHS, cable, and streaming and video games. 24 made it real innovative with its real time episodes set in an hour (with commercials). Then in 2004, ABC kicked off its hit season with Desperate Housewives and Lost. Created by the same guy who made Jennifer Garner a sex icon in Alias, Lost is about a crew of plane passengers that crash into an island trying to find their way home. LIke seinfeld, the series finale is not as good as other finales but concludes the most confusing tv storyline ever made. I remember watching part of the two hour season premiere which at the time was the most expensive TV pilot ever made until Game of Thrones broke that record. I had a crush on Evangeline Lilly before she became the wasp as well as other movie roles and the way it was shot and sounded like felt like a movie. Even the title is very twilight zoneish. It's available to watch for free on IMDB TV as well as on Hulu, so watch all seven seasons if you dare.""
""Lost is somewhat difficult to review as a whole, episode quality varied somewhat, from the incredible opening episode, to the divisive finale. You could argue the show went on for too long, that the broadcaster milked it a little, but for me the show is at its strongest about half way through, series three sees the mystery and suspense cranked up, more questions asked and some good new characters. The final series is a little disappointing, I personally didn't like the conclusion, but I'm sure many fans do.Lost highlights the importance and art of storytelling, as a viewer you are tricked, confused and pushed into many blind alleys, trouble is when you start watching you can't switch off, it's always so engaging. The puzzles unravel slowly.Very well acted all round, I especially liked Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson, Ben is such an interesting character, he adds a lot to the series.I will always be a big fan of Lost, somehow it feels like a game changer.""
""Outlander has been around from 2014 and has year by year become a firmly focused story, which in season 3, episode 8, has now reached a new pinnacle.Never having read any of the books, the theme was unknown to me and certainly has grown in esteem over the years. It took us from the late 1940's to the Scottish highlands in the past, with infighting, disputes, intrigue and outright war. The characters are well developed and play their roles perfectly. In this new phase, 20 story-years later, it is transforming into a powerful, compassionate and personal tale with revelations of those missing 20 years, leaving a posing conundrum.

""The second season of Outlander ended with an epic finale that explored the time travel nature and concluded Claire Randall (Caitriona Balfe) first jaunt back in time. This season explored new annals of history traveling to Paris then back to Scotland and jumping back and forth through time. There was a bit of a slow down when Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and Claire first returned to Scotland. In Paris, Jamie and Claire sought to prevent the slaughter at Culloden Moor by ending the Jacobite rebellion at the source, the bonny Prince Charlie (Andrew Gower). This season delved into the gritty maneuverings of the monarchy through the brothels of Paris. There Jamie encounters the young boy pickpocket Fergus (Romann Berrux) while Claire's pronunciation of smallpox on a shipment of wine makes an enemy of Comte St. Germain (Stanley Weber).Their negotiations and bribes are not enough to stop the tide of history and Jamie mortal enemy Black Jack Randall (Tobias Menzies), the ancestor of Claire's present day husband Frank, shows up in Paris to see to his cousin and generally cause trouble for Jamie who immediately challenges him to a duel though Claire knows that if he dies, then Frank will never exist.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com""

""Season 1 - Oh I really enjoyed the first season. Not exactly top notch as some other Starz series have been but pretty close. Ron Moore of course gave us great quality with BSG back in the 2000's and his delivery on this series is almost as good. Season 1 to me really was all about Tobias Menzies performance. Haha, I loved his dual role as Frank and more importantly Captain 'Black Jack' Randall. Episodes 6 and I think 16 stood out with a couple of the greatest scenes ever. Captain Randall's conversation with Claire in Ep6 and his 'encounter' with Jaime in Ep. 16 were both totally intense. Some really great TV offered here. Season 1 gets a 9/10 from me.Season 2 - Not as impressed with the 1st half of Season 2 Wasn't impressed at all about how Highlander Jaime and Sassanach Beauchamp arrive in France and suddenly become 'all that'. I mean come on now. Everything just falls into place and they are suddenly hobnobbing with royalty??? Yeah that was lame. LAME I say!!! But the 2nd half of season 2 was some good stuff. Back in the Homeland and back with Colum, and Dougal, Angue and Rupert. That's what I really wanted to see. And the Season Finale, that was intense. Almost perfect season finale. Season 2 gets a 7/10""
""Let's face it, the Simpsons popularity has grown over the last twenty years ever since it made it's debut on the Tracey Ullman Show. Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson. Being an animated show has it's advantages though, gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices. The show works because of the powers behind the show's success. Maggie is still a baby, Bart is still a brat, and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart. The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself. In live sitcoms, the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another. There are episodes that are good and plentiful. They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe. I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more. They'll be happy to comply.""
""I just love this show there's absolutely nothing to hate about it there's very smart jokes,memorable episodes and such fantastic characters,and the amazing thing is its considered one of the best T.V. shows in history and its a cartoon and its also been around for more than 20 years,this show is easily the greatest show ever made theirs classical characters such as Homer,Bart,Marge,Lisa,Maggie,Apu,Grampa,D.R. Hibbert,Groundskeeper Willie,Principal Skinner,Otto,Sideshow Bob,Chief Wiggum,Santas Little Helper,Ned Flanders,Nelson,Moe,M.R. Burns,Milhouse,Smithers,Barney and Krusty and it also has gotten more than 400 episodes and with all the things that can happen around Springfield and a tree house of horror every season it will never run out of ideas,the Simpsons is without a doubt my favourite show and I give it a deserved 10/10.""
""'Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a well spoken bounty hunter who acquires Django (Jamie Foxx) to find and kill some men who are wanted, dead or alive. Dr. Schultz isn\'t too keen on the live part.The film divides itself into two parts. After the bounty hunting episodes are through, our duo conceive a plan to rescue the wife of Django (Kerry Washington) by purchasing her from Candie Land plantation. Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn\'t enter the film until the second part.Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in Blazing Saddles. The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would of had a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.Tarantino fans will not be disappointed. Great sound track.Parental Guidance: F-bomb,N-word, nudity (Kerry Washington). No sex. Killing and slow motion blood splatter.'""
""Kowabunga!! The characters are all classics on this show. What this show does so well when you watch it a lot is defines it's characters sharply & throw in so much comedy that the throw away lines are even great. When you watch this enough & think Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, Moe, Crusty the Clown, Montgomery Burns, & Abu (among others), you get a mental picture of the character & sometimes see people in your real life who resemble them. Some of the resemblance is deliberate when you consider Matt Gronig's mind. Some of it is happen stance.Regardless, the show will always have its critics because it does shoot from the hip & hit raw nerves about almost any subject. In truth, it is that edge that makes it great. It takes any topic & lampoons it. It recreates great scenes from past TV & movies & lampoons them. Nothing is sacred on the Simpons. That's Funny!!!""
""'A modern day \'Flintstones\'.  This show is already a classic, and it is still running.  The writers are having a hard time finding new material, but keeps fresh with modern day social humor.  Homer can be a little too much at times.  The show pushes against Political correctness to the limit.  The only weak character is the Doctor, I know it is a poke at the cosby show but hey that show has been off the air for over 11 year and a lot of viewers miss that punch line.  It\'s getting too old.  My favorite episode is the time travel one with Homer.  Only problem, with the show\'s popularity, is the over play of reruns.  I am starting to become sick of the over played episodes, and it will become another MASH.  MASH used to be shown 7 days a week like the the Simpsons.  It is too bad, we had to wait for 4 years for it to come to Canada. You see a lot of Conan O\'Brien humor in both shows.'""

Mr. Vanilla (Petersen) leads the Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) unit comprised of a bunch of actors who look like a bunch of actors while playing it fast and loose with the forensic sciences. Tight, fast moving, and formulaic, CSI solves cases like an Energizer bunny on Speed with no room for character development, emotional investments, back stories, buy-ins, and drama. The result is a hugely popular fare of fast food for small screen freaks which will play best with less sophisticated and discerning TV viewers.

""I love these kinds of shows, so I came across CSI:Crime Scene Inestigation by accident while flicking through channels, and since that moment I have been hooked. I like how each crime is looked at from a different perspective, it offers a whole new slant on things, although some of the more disturbing/graphic images may turn your stomach a little. Also, I love the colours the series is shot in, reds, blues, greens and yellow, really a treat to the eye, and the photography is very impressive. And the music is funky and cool, well the theme song is from The Who, they ooze with coolness. I like the writing, Grissom's dialogue and asides are a joy to behold especially, and the methodical but well structured story lines. The season finales nearly always manage to be gripping and compelling. And the acting is great, William Peterson was wonderful as Grissom, and although I was sad to see him go, the character's departure was handled very well so I was glad of that. The reason why it isn't quite as good as it could have been is because somehow I don't find it as well thought out as the earlier seasons. And while Laurence Fishburne is a great actor and does a good job, I kind of miss Grissom if you get the jist. That said though, this is a great show. 8/10 Bethany Cox""

""While being one of the funniest shows on television, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not afraid to address complicated social issues in enlightening ways. From addressing racial discrimination to poverty, the gang always find some strange way to explore difficult situations in a hilarious way.

Charlie (Charlie Day) got jealous of a tapeworm and finally impregnated the waitress (Mary Elizabeth Ellis). Frank (Danny DeVito) had trouble with his fluid business and Dee (Kaitlin Olson) became obsessed with destroying the life of a male stripper.The gang never fail to go over the top with their outlandish and idiotic schemes that from filming Mac and Charlie's parents and turning it into a sitcom to trying their hand at public relations. Cricket (David Hornsby) got an episode where his father tries to pull out of poverty, though his descent due to Dee is too far to ever come back from.

They should know about her, because she's great. Also, Danny Devito's character is very funny.The show is actually pretty insane at many times. There are people getting stabbed, in The Christmas special, I think one of the characters bites someone. It's crazy. My favorite show on television is Curb your enthusiasm with Larry David, and that show is rated R too. Those shows are better. The R rated ones.

I don't know what the script writers were thinking but to me they are going completely the wrong way. And that's too bad because I really had big hopes for this show. The actors are not bad at all though, it's just the storyline that isn't good enough. They should more focus on the real hacking and anarchy then the mental issues of Elliot Alderson.

Marty Byrde is a fascinating character, and I love those moments where he talks himself out of an impossible situation; it's interesting to see a crime show where the protagonist never results to violence. Ruth is a terrific character as well. The plotting is elaborate and fairly convincing.But I find my interesting waxing and waning throughout each episode. And in general I'm not big on shows where characters hop from one disaster to the next; it's exhausting.""
""'/refers to Season 1/Recent years I have somehow moved away from US drama/crime series as I have found the UK and Scandinavian ones catchier. But thanks to some references and promotion materials (incl. IMDB) I have run into series like Ozark - with distinct characters and performances, solutions without external intervention, events developing in narrow areas, thrill mixed with personal intertwinings, etc. Well, one can always question the plausibility of depicted crimes in a democratic society, but if well explained and expressed, then you follow the course of events without wtf! and blah! feelings.

""Any civilization that can construct such gigantic walls, hundreds of miles long, surely possesses the technology to wipe out the titans; unless I missed it, this is never explained. The graphics are striking, especially the action sequences, and you never quite get used to the titans' facial expressions; they look like bored people waiting for a bus, which is all the more discomforting when they casually pop a human being in their mouth. About that FF button: there are long, long sequences of character development dialogue that could have been shortened considerably in order to tighten the storyline; sometimes this development goes on for several episodes in a row. The classic escalating argument/arrive at a conclusion storytelling armature is rather stretched to its practical limits, and repeats itself many times during the course of the show, long after your patience is exhausted. The entire female titan story arc is rather thrilling and suspenseful, and the payoff is worth the investment of time. Eren can't speak without screaming, so I had to turn my volume way down whenever his face pops up. The whole 3d maneuvering device thing was pretty cool. Overall I loved this series, well what I've seen of it so far, and I'll continue watching.""

Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again! So on that note, I highly recommend Gone Girl.""

""Archer is James Bond in sitcom form. Unlike Bond, Archer's mother is the head of the secret service agency he works for. And this mother and son couple do not get along at all. They find joy in the other's humiliation and/or pain. This show is incredibly entertaining, and while the animation is impressive in detail it feels weird to watch at times because it doesn't have the same 'flow' as cel-animation. That's probably because it's done on Adobe After Effects and/or Flash.Spy fiction is a creative pool writers can screw around with endlessly: they can dig into the many clichÃÂ©s of James Bond films, The Bourne Films, and just being all-round nostalgic for films of the 60s. It's like if Ian Fleming teamed up with Mel Brooks, Trey Parker and Matt Groening.Very good stuff, and guarantees your full attention and enjoyment.""
""I honesty don't understand how this show doesn't get as much buzz as some of the other adult cartoons out there. This amazing show is smart, cynical, funny, perfectly voiced and suitably animated (the only reason that I took off a star form a perfect rating, though with time you absolutely get used to the style of animation).\nIt has almost perfect character development throughout the series without too much drama. Captivating characters that in my opinion so much better than all other similar cartoons. Absolutely amazing re-watch value (I watched all the seasons up to date at least several times). This show did get a cult following and I'm really happy that it got renewed (hopefully for many more seasons), but it should be definitely have much more buzz.Keep on creating!""

Those series really well done as pace was really good in those series and there not many filler episode (This current season) After season 3, I think that when really start to lose it's charm , it did have some good decent and now again, I which really enjoyed. The next few season were a really mixed bag and this latest series is to me as been really bad, I have worst series yet, I don't think there was on decent episode I liked this year!

""Don't get me wrong, I do love sitcoms. I love Frasier, I love Friends, I love Cheers, I love Black Adder, I love Last of the Summer Wine(mostly) and I love Fawlty Towers. But I just can't get into How I Met your Mother. At first it was alright, there were some good ideas, some of the situations were at least fun. But as the show has progressed, in my personal opinion it is running out of ideas and it feels more dull and laboured by the minute. I do like the production values, and there is one good character Barney, wonderfully played by Neil Patrick Harris. The other characters I don't care for, in general I find them stupid and unlikeable, while the writing and jokes are forced and predictable now that the show lacks a good pace and freshness and some of the situations are not at all funny, more inane if anything. The acting also feels forced and over-compensated, as if the actors know their characters and writing are lacking and they're trying to make it work. Harris in my opinion is the one exception who doesn't suffer, that's because he's that good an actor, he has had some bad material but he always gives his all to elevate it. All in all, I do like sitcoms and comedies when they're good, but How I Met Your Mother is an example of one I can't get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox""

I gave up after only two episodes.The rest of the cast is very good. The closest Shameless comes to nobility is oldest daughter Fiona, beautifully played by Emmy Rossum, who single-handedly gives the show a reason for being and viewers a possible reason for returning. Fiona is afraid to hope for more than she has, yet may have found it in a nice man who comes to her rescue at a bar. He is well played too.The family dysfunction is entertaining. And so is Emmy Rossum, in addition to being very easy to look at and watch!

""Not a bad show. There are highs and lows. Decent writing. Decent directing. Some scenes are outstanding. Suspense and originality make a for a good combination. Character progression is smooth and stable, but there are sometimes when I get bored and want to skip forward. Cool cinematography, special effects and an effort to make things realistic add to the quality of the production. It's not perfect. It has flaws which are obvious. However all the good things I like about the show carry it forward. I like the mix of the politics and multiple story arcs. It also has great season finales because they are cliff hangers, leaving you wanting more.""
""'Gone Girl is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband\'s family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple\'s marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in Gone Girl to engage our interest except for Fincher\'s jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****'""

The park is maintained by robotic 'hosts', who aid the fulfilment of the guests desires.

""'I was not too eager to start watching this series - I am not into sci- fi too much, I am not a huge fan of Nolan Bros., and I have not seen the 1973 film of the same name. But, on the other hand, one should widen your horizons and names like Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Sidse Babett Knudsen, and some others were solid and convincing.Well, the first episodes were not too promising - the pace was slow, the scenes and ideas confusing, and I did not know what to expect or what was really going on (as mentioned, I was totally unaware of the subject matter). But then, gradually, when some issues were clarified and constant references to the past and reps started make sense, I began to live and feel together with both main characters and the ideas of this series, not paying so much attention on the sci-fi portion. The performances were at least good, if not more, and the criminal features and angles (what I always like) started to override the other nuances and aspects. The settlement, however, did not correspond to my taste fully, and pondering on and over human significance, fate, etc. has been expressed and dissected in many more dynamic and even works before.Thus, that is why only 7 points from me. I could name tens of series more mellowed and catchy, with less blunt reasoning on mankind\'s place in the world.'""

And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the Madea guy.

I am incredibly impressed with this show and love the fact that it is not your typical lawyer drama. When I first heard of this show I heard good things but the ad just did not do it justice. I wasn't expecting much but from the very first episode I was hooked. The writing is incredibly smart and witty and it feels like the cool organisation in the real world. Some shows you roll your eyes at how absurd it is but the outrageous things in Suits feel completely plausible.There is definitely room to improve and develop on the storyline and I think they have the ability to do this. I will be continuing to watch this show for a while to come and think it will just get better and better.
""'So, the WB puts out some really, really bad programming. Then there\'s this one, which reminds me of Northern Exposure in very peculiar ways: small town, quirky characters, odd occurances (deer ramming into Jeep; swan attacking Jess, etc.). The writing is sometimes a tad pretentious for its own good, but the well developed characters and the more frequent high quality writing make it worthwhile to wade through. Although I know how TV storylines develop at a snail\'s pace and the WB tries to be a family-oriented network, I still sometimes get frustrated at the tiptoeing the show does around certain issues and situations. It\'s all a lot of fun, however, so if you\'re free Tuesday nights ... then take a look (although, if you\'re on this site, then you probably already have).

The writing and scripts of this show are so interesting and lovable you have Lorelai Gilmore as a thirty year old single mother, which is played wonderfully by Lauren Graham. Lorelai tries to raise her college-aged daughter Rory Gilmore, while at the same time deal with love and relationships in her small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai is witty, and a feisty coffee addict while working at the local hotel inn, yet she shows a toughness in dealing with her daughter Rory who could quote an oxford dictionary, plus dealing with the Grandparents isn\'t easy when they try to side with Rory, Lorelai always holds her head high and love conquers all. While this season the show seems to be losing some luster and good stories, it\'s still interesting with the love triangle that Lorelai has with Luke. To sum it up this is still in my opinion one of the better and most underrated shows around why Lauren Graham doesn\'t receive more credit and awards is beyond me, she is sexy and has a sharp witty intellect.'""

Woody is intense and just as good at drama as comedy. Oh dear Alexandra, don't think I can see you in Percy Jackson stuff anymore! Michelle Monaghan is pretty here and a bit too pretty for a small town cop's wife but never mind.The two time frames are quite well differentiated they are aged appropriately with effective hair and makeup so it's not confusing.The thick drawls can be a bit hard to understand. The main problem is that the plot is revealed through some of these mumblings and it makes it easy to miss plot elements. Should not have to concentrate so hard to decipher the plot.So far the crimes aren't that interesting but it's early days after only 3 episodes. Hopefully it picks up.""
""Purely based on the excellent actors and their skills I rate True Detective at seven stars. But that's just because the actors are really top notch. You can't fault any of them. Remarkable acting. But other then that this show is way too complicated to make it have a better score. And that's a pity. The amount of different characters make it difficult to watch. It's sometimes also a bit slow. I just finished the second season and the ending was disappointing. But for the rest you get a show with excellent filming, excellent sound and excellent actors. I don't get why they want to make it so complicated. Just simplify it a bit and you get one of the best series on television. If they would make a third season I will probably watch it. But to me they can just stop after those two seasons. There are way better shows then this one.""
""'/refers to Season 1/I tend to like gloomy crime series, where felonies are not glamorized and detectives do not look wealthy fashion models, but as for the plot, there are 2 options for me: either the evildoer is latent to the very end, or he/she is known from the beginning and one can follow his/her actions and law enforcement efforts to catch and punish. Here, the content is focused on detectives only - in past and present, the pace is protracted, and the essence of the crime and the offender\'s person were evident too soon. Thus, both the pre-ending and ending are rather trivial as well.True, Matthew McConaughey as Detective Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart are splendid, there is a good chemistry between them regardless how they get along, but the rest are just good (perhaps due to non-elaborated characters), and there is no fitting antagonist present who could provide intensity and witty nuances to potential cat-and-mouse play. And last but not least: the almost 8 hours is too much, it could have been easily shorter twice, or a 2-3 hours TV-movie.'""
""Dr Temperance 'Bones' Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works at the Jeffersonian (read Smithsonian) Institute in Washington DC. Along with an interesting team of scientists we also have Special Agent Seely Booth an FBI Agent who acts as the liaison with Dr Brennan when her skills are necessary for an investigation, which is not surprisingly quite often.Initially I expected this interesting series would run out of steam in trying to come up with situations where the FBI required the assistance of a forensic anthropologist. Surprisingly though some may find the realism stretched somewhat I think it works for the most part.For those interested in the forensics the science comes across as interesting at least to a layman, much as it does in the original CSI series. The other strength of the show is relationship dynamics, the most important of which is between Dr Brennan and Agent Booth. The close relationship between the two characters is seemingly unlikely because of their differences but it works very well.The series is based on the life and the novels of Kathy Reichs who like her character is both a Forensic Anthropologist and a best selling author.""
""'Bones is a great show, one with fine acting and interesting oddball characters. It\'s one of those detective-forensic shows that are all the rage nowadays, but you know what, it\'s all good fun. Based on the real-life experiences of a real forensic expert Kathy Reichs, Dr. Temperance Bones Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is the star of the show, the preeminent medical expert at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. A bit socially unskilled but every bit dedicated to her work, she and her team of equally socially unskilled oddball co-workers work together to solve murders where many times all they have are bones to go on. On the justice side of it, is Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz, of Angel) of the F.B.I., who often teams up with Brennan to go after the bad guys. This is a fun show, one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and not have to really think about it too much. It\'s just pure entertainment; what more could you want?'""
""I like Bones in spite of the silly and often inaccurate pretensions this criminal investigation drama is built upon. Bones is a low EQ high IQ forensic anthropologist who solves murder mysteries using the assumed power of science. The reality of forensics however is nowhere near as analytic as this show would have you believe. Its an imprecise art more than a science and as such its prone to error. The other limitation, with Bones, is it is inclined to be a bit corny and clinched, at times. This is exacerbated by the shows tendency to make rather shallow, moral judgments, that, like the shows forensics, simply don't stand up too well to scrutiny. Casting these shortcomings aside what makes Bones work for me is the interplay between the main characters. The cast of actors work well together and compliment one another.The relationships that develop between them also give this show a sense of family that is familiar and at times charming. Bones lack of emotional intelligence leads to some genuinely funny moments too. The episodic stories are innovative with enough interesting plot twists and turns to keep the viewers attention. Definitely worth a hour or so of your time (just not over dinner as some of the forensic scenes can be a bit graphic).""
""'Amongst the sea of crime shows clogging up the air waves, this one is better than most. The casting, acting and writing are above average. Personally though the gratuitous use of graphic gore gets to be tiresome. It seems like the writing staff sit around and compete to see how they can introduce more disgusting situations each week when in reality bodies do not decompose at the rate they depict and for the most part are intact. This, in addition to how the squints can pinpoint locations and facial recognition from some of the most far fetched ways detracts from what is basically a pretty good series. There are some interesting characters, but also many inconsistencies in their behaviours/development. As the seasons progress, there tends to be an overemphasis on their sexual personal lives which is typical of Hollywood agendas.'""
""Bones has always been a formula show - find body, look at skeleton, see cause of death, track down killer. Along the way, we get a glimpse into some unique social sub-culture, giving Brennan the opportunity to play cultural anthropologist and explain human behavior to Booth in her own twistedly uber-scientific way. Yet, even after 80+ episodes I find myself NOT tiring of the formula, thanks to the great chemistry between the leads, plus the likable gang of supporting characters - Hodgins, Sweets, etc. - and the continuing high production values and well thought out mysteries. Plus one of the greatly appealing aspects of the show - the idea that we are eavesdropping on people working at the very cutting edge of forensic technology - also has not gotten old. Nor has the will they, won't they nature of the relationship between the two principals. Normally one of these slow burn Remington Steele romances has a best before period of about three seasons, after which the viewer loses interest over things apparently not going anywhere. Here, though, the unique nature of the Brennan character makes the slow approach logical and necessary. The show is still operating at the high level of quality, interest and creativity that initially made it a hit and fans of the show will not be disappointed by the latest season.""

It was this intense exchange between the two main characters that draws you right back in to the success of the original 1993 ground breaking Science Fiction series. Are we witnessing a bigger conspiracy than the Manhattan project? What was the outcome of the Manhattan project? Was this the cause of the initial entry of aliens to earth that the government kept secret for the past 70 years?There is so much information that Mulder and Scully are provided by the new rich guy Tad O\'Malley (played by Joel McHale) that we the audience may start to believe that our own government is the biggest conspirator of hidden agendas and that the government would actually blame the cataclysmic outcome on our neighboring nations that would result in World War III. Or worse is there a global warming theory that has the elitist heading to another planet as the world is destroyed? I just loved that the great character actor Rance Howard was provided a part in the pilot episode as he divulges critical information to Mulder.It is a great start for the re-boot. Too bad it will be limited to only 6 episodes.'""
""I have a huge amount of love for Gone Girl, it helped to re-ignite interest into a genre of films that had really started to die off, the mystery. I firmly believe Gone Girl inspired the likes of Girl on the Train to be made, another great book in its own right, but Gone Girl showed that a mystery could be made into a movie that would pack out cinemas.I read the book and loved it, I loved the film too, I thought the characterisations were superb, so my words are based purely on the film.You'd think they're the couple that had everything, she's successful, beautiful, wealthy, charismatic, the perfect wife. He's handsome, funny, with a jaw line you'd kill for, but not all is at it seems.The plot is awesome, the misdirection is excellent, an hour in, and you realise that what you thought was happening isn't necessarily so.Terrific, great music, well acted, humorous, it's a cracker. 9/10""
""X-Files is an iconic show. It had a great run.The show is about Aliens and supernatural occurrences. 2 mellow detectives are put on the cases to find out what's going on.The acting, story the theme song the music, many episodes were just gold. Back then X-Files, King of the Hill and Simpsons owned Sunday evenings.Verdict: Theme song plays in your head...""
'Schitts CreekThe lot seasons 1 - 6Loved it!This show is one of those rare occasions when it excellence surpasses criticism.'
I have enjoyed watching this comic show. It helps when you have great characters and writing. I especially love Chris Elliot's character as the mayor. Everything about this show is first rate!\n*** out of ****
""Do not expect too much out of this drama, but Schitt's Creek has it's way to entertain the viewer, with the simple plot and the nice character build up. Thoughout the four seasons (that's where I'm now!!) the characters experianced huge changes that didn't come overnight or served to you in the gasp of a few episodes. So, because it manages to entertain and it didn't follow the same plot and theme for all its seasons, 7 out of 10.""
There was nothing resembling a good joke in the pilot episode and everything was as predictable as yesterday's weather. Rich family thrown out of their mansion yet they own an entire small town? I don't get it. The show is like a bad episode of Green Acres and they were all bad. So we begin with a tired premise and from there we are given stock characters without a trace of humor or originality and then there is the fact that the writing is amateurish. One of the gags in the first episode is the doors are taken off their motel rooms. I don't get it. How is that funny? Don't answer that because I already know the answer: it isn't funny. The two children are completely annoying which isn't synonymous with funny. Toilet humor rears its ugly head early on. Comedy has gone to this little town to die.
Clever and sexy...but after season two it's nothing but nonsense...
Omg I love this show I thought I will hate because of twilight but I was wrong. The acting and storylines are decent.I will rate it perfect if it didn't go downhill after season 4 and if elena was not being stupid half the time
""'Television meet Twilight! The Vampire Diaries is Vampires meets a soap opera. I have watched a full 15 minutes of the show, and other bits and pieces here and there of The Vampire Diaries, while my wife is glued to the show. Here are my deductions of The Vampire Diaries First deductions everyone is hot or good looking on the show. Too much eye candy! Second the Twilight recurring theme of rival vampires, witches, and who is going be turned into a vampire reminds me of some sort of high school click. Romance/drama forbidden love. One girl has the hots for the other\'s boyfriend. The show has the usual soap opera sub plots back stabbing, infighting, lies, secrets. I miss the entertainment value of the show but my wife loves it. I give the show a 2 and my wife give it a 9/10.'""
""Last kingdom Is nowhere near big-budget productions like Vikings and other recent medieval shows. It lacks any artistic perspective and visuals to back it. No actor can Carry the credability of hardened bloodthirsty Vikings. Costumes feels just tacked on modern day dudes, its B level at Most and not convincing like Vikings and GOT that can be mature. First episode is about a annoying boy who can't act at all, its laughable bad and the drama that follows is not very convincing. A few losers in the kingdom blabbering like old ladies while vikings knocking at their front door. And it gets worse. Its so boring and full of plotholes. It doesnt possess the gritty, feral, Dark and intriguing bits like other tvshows allready has. Fighting scenes are truly bad, no good erotic scenes either. You want this kingdom get burned down the more you watch it.\nI just can't see where all the positive reviews comes from? the last kingdom is something you watch when you absolutely has nothing better to do. Its sub-par with any other random boring medieval show. You watch it and forget about it.""
'I love this show It has it all history drama comedy great writing along with settings and acting I have just started to watch the series from the first season again it is that good .I think this show and Vikings are 2 of the best action packed captivating and superb historical dramas of the decade. Such a shame as I think it is on its last season as is Vikings I will miss such excellence'
""THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie.""
""The Last Kingdom is a compelling, if somewhat confusing, historical drama. The key character Uhtred is a man caught between worlds. A Saxon raised as a Viking, who then returns to his Saxon roots. What I find confusing is why does he stay? The Saxons treat him like dirt, whilst he has an open offer to join the loyal son of his dead Viking father. I can see why the dynamic has been set up this way but perhaps, like others, I'm wondering when Uhtred will see the light and change sides. The acting in this series is excellent. Indeed, aside from a few inconsistencies in the plot, this series is a polished affair in all respects. Eight out of ten from me.""

This is a slightly more flashy setup. They're using more CG. The big addition is the holodeck, an artificially created environment, which is basically a virtual reality. This series is most notable for restarting the series with a sequel and new characters/actors. This would lead to even more movies. It is definitely a worthy continuation of the Star Trek universe. That is not always a guarantee especially for an iconic series like Star Trek.""

I would give it six stars if possible. \n1. Great cinematography especially color effects; angles; editing. \n2. Really intelligent dialogue for a crime series. \n3. Acting - top of the game. \n4.

Up there with True Detective; Orange is the New Black; Game of Thrones; Orphan Black; The Wire; Sherlock; Peaky Blinders.
'Fan of Seinfeld and watched all seasons of this series. Season 9 shows it\'s time to pack it in and retire. The episodes are not as satirical as before and greater reliance is placed on star power cameos to carry them. It\'s always best to go out on the highest note possible. That should be now as another season on this trajectory will be a disaster.'
""The series was actually surprisingly good. There were plenty of funny moments and the main character was entertaining. The rest of them were ridiculous and I've found myself often rooting for Larry and sympathising with him, even though he is a difficult character to begin with. However, the series was entertaining overall.""
""'There are few men working on television today that rival the wit, the insight, or the genius of Larry David. To compare Curb Your Enthusiasm to Seinfeld is preposterous. With Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David has created one of the greatest comedic series one have ever seen on American television. Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.Most of the episodes have been directed by Robert Weide, who seems to be attuned to Mr. David\'s kind of comedy. The episodes directed by the other guest directors are fine as well, but it seems that Mr. Weide gets the best out of all performers in the ones he is at the helm.The cast is flawless. Larry David is always enjoyable playing himself, something that is no small accomplishment. He is just a natural. Cheryl Hinds plays Larry\'s wife with a lot of style. Jeff Garlin, as Larry\'s manager, is good. Many talented performers are seen in different episodes among them, Sisie Essman, Wanda Sykes, Richard Lewis, and Ted Danson.Curb Your Enthusiasm has a quality that most other sitcoms don\'t have and it is the ability to amuse us even in reruns! This happens because of Larry David\'s tremendous intelligent approach to comedy.'""
""Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy in Goodfellas.It stars Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta.This is a true-life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill,who happens to be a small time gangster that takes part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito.His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, is badly affected by his partners success and decided to bring about the downfall of his mob partners.Goodfellas has one great achievement about organized crime and the mob.It portrays the benefits of being part of the mob and at the same time puts guilt upon them and never glamorizes them one bit.Also,it narrates man's constant lust for power and greed.Overall,this is one great crime classic.""
""'Diversity is good but Jimmy Olsen has red hair and freckles, for God\'s sake! He\'s not a tall Black basketball player! Also, too many people know who she is! It\'s not much of a secret! Special effects look pretty good and Supergirl certainly looks the part. Wrong hair color! She should be a blond, not strawberry-blonde! Good casting! The violence is a bit intense. A villain\'s death in the pilot was unnecessary, in my opinion, even if it is a Krypton alien. Some good touches: A man is stronger than a girl even on Krypton and although invulnerable by Earth standards, not totally so against fellow aliens. Please don\'t turn this into another Buffy series, please! Future episodes will tell. Even Smallville was bad for a while with it\'s monster of the week concept. The airplane rescue scene was fabulous and so were Dean Cain and Helen Slater as her Earth parents. Allie Mcbeal is the perfect foil as Kara\'s overbearing boss. We shall see about the rest.

""I haven't seen a series in a long time that has such a simple story told - dadg already old school. The story follows a strictly straightforward action, without complicated side paths. That works amazingly well in a modern series era, in which storytelling in particular is constantly being tried to increase. At Sons of Anarchy everything stays simple, direct and in your face. Just like the clientele in which the series plays. Angry rocker gangs that fight through life with brutality and simple laws. Amazingly entertaining and sometimes shocking for such a genre.""

New Girl is so delightful and hilarious! I absolutely love the cast they're superb. The writers wrote everything so perfectly in my opinion I'm sure the series stays mostly entertaining. I'm glad IMDB's rating is 7.7 definitely deserves it!
""'Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi\'s book Wiseguy by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta\'s wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we\'re seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****'""
""'I have watched every episode of New Girl, but sometimes I consider stopping. Why? Because this show take quirkiness beyond what is funny sometimes. The writers of this show apparently think that silly = funny. Sometimes it does, but if characters\' actions and words seem to have no purpose than to be weird, the humor loses its edge.I compare this to Suburgatory which is also a quirky show, but it retains its edge through clever writing that includes insight, parody, and critique.I love the cast of New Girl. I have always been a fan of Zooey Deschanel. Hannah Simone is beautiful and talented. Actually, all of the leads have talent. I just wish they were given roles that allowed them to say clever things, i.e. perceptive things, sometimes. Most of the dialogue is just silliness.'""
""New girl had a nice, solid first season. It was funny, it was witty, it was interesting, it had the friendship, woman-man dynamics and americans in their late twenties living together theme. Second season was just mediocrity. Third season tried to hard. For the fourth season, I've decided to get advise from the fellow viewers and their reviews about it and I came to a conclusion that it is just a waste of time. So, maybe watch the two first season and leave it there, if you want to try this one, something that the producers of this show should have done as well. Or at least, they should have provided fresh material and entertaining jokes. The characters change in the blink of an eye and not in a good way. The romance is just boring, the jokes old and tiring after being repeated for some seasons now, the actors look like they themselves got tired of this show and overall, the plot drags. So 3 out of 10.""
""New Girl has made a star of actress Zooey Deschanel. She plays Jess, a teacher who moves in with three male friends in a loft warehouse. I caught this show on and off for the last three seasons. This show is quirky sometimes more so and can be either annoying or charming. The show isn't filmed in front of the audience and done on location in Los Angeles, California. I love Max Greenfields Schmidt character who is playing a Don Draper type character. I don't know how long this show will go on in seasons. Zooey is talented and charming as Jess. But we know sitcoms have a shorter life expectancy than dramas. I relate to Jess in some parts.""

Now they've got to work at getting the thinking audience back on track.

""This season of The 100 stresses the fact that despite our moral compasses we all have devils inside us whuch have to be overcome in order for us to heal and move forward. For some, it's a more prominent force and takes several mistakes to drive the sword through the demon, although the heart-wrenching journey and action of the battle is an out-of-this-world experience.Clarke's journey starts when she meets her counterpart in the form of Josephine Lightbourn (Sara Thomas), a thrilling sociopathic princess with more depth, wits, and complexity than any anti-hero is allowed to have. Being stuck inside her own head gives the female lead ample opportunity to reflect and straighten out her choices with the help of a few blasts from the past.Eliza Taylor does an outstanding job with her acting in the way she portrays Clarke, Josephine and the one as the other. She switches skins with careful ease and a perfect amount of the imposter's characteristics.

Due to circumstances, 100 of them--teens and young adults--are sent to an unknown fate on Earth\'s surface, where they set up an elementary society and try to survive in dangerous environs.Grounders are living on the surface, as are at least two other societies of people. The plot hits its stride when the remaining satellite people also descend to the surface. So many posters complain about absurd plot points, some of which are incorrect or irrelevant. I assume these reviewers refused to watch Star Trek because of absurd story lines and scientific improbabilities. That is their prerogative. But those who can suspend some disbelief will find a complex story about social order and the nature of man. There are some very good actors involved. The visuals are rich. And the cast expands as the characters meet and become familiar with others. I might add, without giving away any spoilers, that the new world of this unfamiliar Earth offers many surprises and a few unexpected secrets.Update 12/16/14: This series has proved that it is on the right track. The plot lines are engaging and the characters are well-defined. I am upgrading my vote to 8.'""
""'after so many time and a lot of books, films, clubs , shows about vampires, it is strange to discover the series seductive like at the first meeting. maybe naive but it is not its sin. maybe soft but it is part of different period. but the same. a new hero, huge challenges, drops of love, horror and a brave girl. nothing new but so seductive ! for a decade it remains one of fundamental marks. for today it is more than a teenager series but a form of delight. because it reflects, in right manner, expectations, emotions and a beautiful story with deep roots. a new kind of hero and her extraordinaries adventures. the structure of each fairy tale.'""
""Buffy may not seem like anything special when first hearing of it, and although it starts as a campy B-horror show, it becomes so much more as it goes along. True, it can be episodic, but that only helps it to have some of the strongest stand-alone episodes I have ever seen on TV, and also some of the most emotionally-involving story lines. Although it's a plot-driven show, it's also about the characterization that comes with it and the different directions in which the writing takes the characters. The mix of comedy, drama, and horror is pretty unique to Joss Whedon, and it's a testament to his talent that no other shows are quite like this one in tone. The show would be nothing without its actors, and for the most part, they surely deliver. Sarah Michelle Gellar's development as an actress throughout the show is pretty amazing, and actors like Alison Hannigan, James Marsters, Emma Caulfield are also among the best and show what they have. Truly, this is a show that stays in the heart. Truly recommended.""
""Buffy was one of those shows as a kid you would glimpse at and not know what was going on but at the same time kind of like the show. BTVS was dark, had drama, romance and it's a 90s icon. Buffy back in those days was THE show to watch. Before Netflix and all these cheesy Superhero shows Buffy was dominating the cable network. Buffy knew how to be a show that can make people relaxtained. It's such a classic product that aged very well.""
""'A totally amazing film by Director Quentin Tarantino was Inglourious Basterds.A group of Nazi soldiers plans to avenge the deaths of Jews throughout Europe by staging a one group hit team to kill as many Nazis as possible.They are soon drawn into a further plot-the killing of top Nazi officials including Hitler himself at a Nazi premier movie glorifying a German soldier who had killed so many.As the German Commander, Christoph Waltz was superb. His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.'""
""My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered.""
'This a great show. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. See it. It got an 8.2. Which is a good rating. But this is such a great show that 8.2 is underrating. I give 10 out of 10. The movie from 1992 is a little bit better. But still this a great show. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. Godzilla (1998) is better. But only by a little bit. Jaws is also better. Still this a great show. It is better then A Nightmare on elm street. And that is not easy to do.'
""It goes beyond my comprehension that people hate this show. They must all be American brainwashed patriots. Seriously get over it, it's just a show and it's a good one. I absolutely love this show, the actors are all very believable in their roles, the storyline is exceptional, full of twists that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole show. At the end of every episode I already want to watch the next one as soon as possible. Everything that you think happens in real life when you think about CIA, espionage, terrorists and so on passes the register. Conspiracies, paranoia, double-crossing, betrayal, false promises etc. Clair Danes puts down a brilliant performance playing an unstable CIA analyst. To me the whole series is full of action and suspense. One of the best series!""
I watched around 4 seasons before until I started losing interest cause me and my mom used to watch together. I'm giving another chance and really appreciate this terrorist/CIA based show! Damien Lewis among so many others are so great; the acting is incredible which is understandable Homeland has lasted so long. I absolutely love the beginning credits and gripping story.
""'We were not able to watch this when it was originally broadcast but my wife and I have been watching it now, 2017, via HULU online streaming. When we watch it we usually watch 2 consecutive episodes, sort of like watching a movie.We just finished season 2 and now have started on season 3. The theme of the series is terrorist threats to the USA homeland after the attacks of 9-11. The main character is Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, CIA agent. Often brilliant, often inappropriate, a highly flawed individual who is always focused on her job, tracking down terrorists and foiling their plots. Sometimes she is successful, sometimes not.Her boss is Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, always a calming influence. In seasons 1 and 2 much of the focus is on British actor Damian Lewis doing a real good American accent as Marine Nicholas Brody, captured by terrorists abroad for 8 years, presumed dead by many including his wife and two children. When he returns as a Muslim the running question is whether he is legit or whether he has become a terrorist also, waiting for the opportunity to take out significant targets.Those 3 actors in those 3 characters make the series interesting. Especially the erratic behavior of Mathison. Danes really is one of the best female actors currently, anyone who missed her performance as Temple Grandin really should look it up.'""

'When did the popeil spray on hair become cool? Was it when homosexuality became a story line? Worst show ever.'
""Actually my mother was a fan before I became one of this show. I can't wait to see it regularly in syndication. The chemistry between CHarlie Sheen and Jon Cryer is absolutely perfect. The Harper brothers are both opposites. The casting of Angus Jones as Charlie's son Jake is quite brilliant. He is so naturally funny to watch on the show. I love seeing Holland Taylor but we don't see enough of her as their domineering, critical mother who could put Marie Barone to shame. She's not that kind of mother who will bake cookies and take her grandson to the zoo. She's a more contemporary grandmother. Anyway it's great to see Conchetta Farrell as the maid, Bert. She's more than just the maid, her timing is just about perfect. I love seeing Melanie Lynskey who I didn't recognize from Heavenly Creatures as lovesick stalker of Alan Harper and neighbor. Her role of Rose is not to be ignored at all. She is quite the up and coming actress. I would have never guessed that she was a New Zealander herself. There is no trace of a Kiwi accent. The show itself has come along way from the beginning and I hope to see more in the future.""
""Okay, when this show first started, I actually quite liked it. I found the writing quite funny and creative and I liked some of the interplay between the characters. But over time, Two and a Half Men has become duller and more stale, I feel similarly about How I Met Your Mother too. The production values are good as is Charlie Sheen, the only actor to have any real life in his character, but that's it. The writing and jokes that were once creative are now stale and forced, even lacking in subtlety, while the story lines introduce good themes but don't introduce and explore them well and the stories themselves feel rushed and predictable. The characters are not very likable now, some actually are annoying and act like idiots. Now they've replaced Sheen, while I am overall not impressed with the show, I think regardless of his problems I think replacing him is a mistake, without him the show really is going to be a dead weight even with all the other faults it has. All in all, a decent show when it started, now it is unwatchable and hard to get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox""
""'Like it\'s star Any Poehler (that\'s not a typo, I know what I said), this show was cute, but predictable & ridicously overrated. A cringey & predictable sad-trombone rom-com that was initially saved by the hilariously cynical character of Ron Swanson, but eventually they ruined him by turning him into a rom-com clichÃÂ© too, and I was done.'""
""This is a good ensemble-cast show (with a lead role) made in the same vein as the office. It generates plenty of laughs despite the lack of a laughtrack-it doesn't need one. Amy Poehler is perfect in the lead role as Leslie Knope, the head of the Parks & Recreation department in a small town in Indiana. She does her best to head her job and her department-often with hilarious results. Rashida Jones heads up a terrific supporting cast. Whether something going on in the city or someone in the department, this comedy finds some sort of hilarious situation in each episode, and the cast clicks perfectly as a workplace type sitcom. Amy Poehler strikes gold! *** out of ****""
""'I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino\'s Inglourious Basterds, saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don\'t realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I\'ve seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie\'s highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly\'s stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in Singin\' in the Rain.Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.'""
""'Amy Pohler\'s character, a 34 year old city hall up and comer has just been appointed to the assignment of her career: Head of a committee to turn a hazardous abandoned construction site into a beautiful recreational park. Public support appears to be minimal, yet our heroine presses on.A side plot reveals the star\'s unrealistic ambitions to take public service all the way to the Oval Office, as well as an inferiority complex toward her mother, who (in contrast to young Amy) is a high ranking city official.I\'m a big fan of the star, and I\'m glad she didn\'t retire after having her baby and leaving SNL. The new show Parks and Recreation, styled after the extremely popular Office, offers a few laughs here and there, but leaves very little for anyone to anticipate and look forward to subsequent episodes.This is a spotlight for a very talented comedienne, but I see no chance for anything remotely comparable to 30 Rock coming from this humble sit-com. Unless someone knows something I don\'t know, the buzz should fizzle long before a full season goes on the air.'""

""I heard about this I was surprised, I loved The Karate Kid which came out in 1984, that starred Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elizabeth Shue, And William Zabka. And part 2 that came out in 1986, but The Karate Kid part 3 that came out in 1989 not so much, but I kind of liked The Next Karate Kid, never really saw the 2010 remake that starred Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan..\nI really enjoyed the show showing how Johnny and Daniel are doing now, and also the other stories that come in the mix. Daniel and Johnny realizing what karate meant to them. There are some throwbacks to the original film, Ralph Macchio and William Zabka get back in there roles perfectly, There are some similarities with original film in some episodes. And the other actors also do well, and the karate scenes are well shot, and the way it ends, I'm eagerly excited for season 2.""
""Impressed, captivated and engaged are the words that come to mind for Cobra Kai. This is what we need from shows, to take unique and interesting angles. Cobra Kai flips the script and gives us the view from Johnny Lawrence, this is really his story. He's the one who lost and turns out to be a real person with very real flaws. Cobra Kai intrigues us with its great narrative. No more one dimensional 'Good vs Evil' story we've all been told a million times over. This reflects the feelings of the 'loser' of the memorable 1984 film Karate Kid and picks up 34 years later. Because of this narrative and spin I find Johnny to be an inspirational figure by trying his best to rebuild his life. Johnny is a very down to earth and simple character and is making the most of the hand dealt to him, isn't that how we live our lives? In a funny way we see the arrogance and attitude sometimes from Daniel Larusso who was originally the hero. Top marks for a great show.""
""'Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by Tom Hanks. It\'s the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in the right place while monumental events are taking place in this nation\'s history.Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is attempting to depict.Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.Gary Sinise\'s performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is also splendid.Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you\'re going to get. With Forrest Gump, you will get the best of the best chocolates.'""
""Jon Hamm is as appealing in this as he is appalling. You may feel stronger with one of those than the other, but while he is the number one character in this, there is a lot more going on here, than might meet the eye. Especially at first, you may not be able to see it. The women are as much part of the whole show as the (Mad) Men. You could even argue that they have a lot more going on at times.The show itself is slow paced though, which may not go down well with some viewers. You really have to be in the mood for the show, for the setting, the time line and all that surrounds it. I know that Jon was hated as much as he was loved by viewers. Because he had so many flaws, but was also intriguing and had that extra special charisma going for him. It's almost impossible to not be enamored by him.Some lingo may not work or may be confusing too, but in the context, you'll never lose sight of things. You don't have to be in the advertising or management business or having lived ages ago. This does work as a bit of a history lesson. And the acting is superb. Of course as with many (recent) shows, it makes sense to have watched all the seasons from the start ... it's character building, even if nuanced""
""There is plenty of stress to go around in this television series. Practically everyone is drinking and smoking to their heart's content. These are men caught up in a frenzy of an advertising agency. They would literally cut each other up if given the opportunity to do so.There are plenty of modern day issues to tackle as we saw this evening when during a fire at a hotel, it's determined that one of the executives is a homosexual.Everything is supposed to be done nicely and to fit in place. This includes the firing of an executive whose dismissal was held up while his wife underwent radiation treatments. Two people have been promoted to take his place. The fired executive's parting scene was comical. He didn't exactly accept going out quietly.An interesting show, but where can all this lead to ultimately?""
""'Sometimes it happens that even a series rounded-up so well continues to be popular on and on, tempting the producers and performers to exploit its fame and reputation even more. Evidently, it is the case here as well, with additional amount of sophistication and the inclusion of all previous main characters who yet have no more absolutely necessary part to play (e.g. Fernando Sucre and Paul Kellerman). The thrill and pace are in place, Michael and Sara both still pleasant, but the localities and settlement of problems bring forth several clichÃÂ©s and predictive events on the account of convincingness, particularly the ones taking place in Yemen.Well, most of them who enjoyed all the first 4 season episodes in sequence, would breeze through this sequel without any major frustration, but those who began their first familiarization here would probably be surprised why this series has been praised so much. Being still above average, one can not fully enjoy it as a separate series (vis-Ã\xa0-vis 24, for example).'""

""During the first couple seasons this show was great.Although the premise was a bit thin, a guy robs a bank to go to prison with his brother and then has no problem getting to his brother once inside.A bit far fetched for me but it got really good after that.I was even able to overlook the ridiculous idea of them escaping and then ending up in a South American prison, which they were also able to easily escape.After that it just got stupid.They brought in Michael Rappaport as a cop??Don't get me wrong, I loved him on The War At Home but he is not capable of playing a cop or FBI agent or whatever he was.But that wasn't even why the show got bad, they were just out of story ideas.It's a shame to see such a great show die such a horrible, prolonged death but I'm getting use to it.Watch the first three seasons and act like that was all there was.""

""I remember my school days and there is one chapter I remember we had in rapid reading section, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Blue Carbuncle. More than half a decade later, I sit here with a smacked gob on how genius people can be.Sherlock follows some of Doyle's works, but the style is extraordinary. With 3 90-minute episodes every series, it really pulls a side story to the beloved bro couple. The writing is very fresh and so in line with the quality that we have today in TV. AMC's Breaking Bad is a strong competitor here.Performances by Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman are what takes the series ahead of all other BBC productions. In fact, the whole cast is par excellence. The first season introduced to the style and here we are in the third season, with a cliffhanger. The music is very melodious and apt for the rather quirky facets of the person the show is based on.The screenplay tries hard to simplify things/dialogs/references but quite fails in some episodes; the fastidious theme aggravates both the viewing and confusion causing factors... For exempli gratia, S01E01 was a 9/10, but S01E02 was only 7/10. But, as we know British TV is much different from its counterparts, Sherlock is a winner.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!""
""'easy to define it - one of great series. smart, example of imagination fireworks, using the basic model in a magnificent manner. and , sure, one of fascinating roles by Benedict Cumberbatch. but that represents only the first level. because it has the gift to be alive. not only good, fascinating or inspired but giving a fresh air who is so rare from series of our period. the game, the solutions, the characters, the mark of a special team behind it, the dialogs and Martin Freeman as the perfect Dr. Watson are answers for the science of profound difference. it is not just a different Sherlock but the same in new package. and the package is so cool...'""

""Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox""

""This series had potential as a gritty yet entertaining updating of the depiction of teens' lives. It's been done before - Skins (the UK version) was particularly good (though only initially: it ran out of steam after about two seasons).Occasionally the series lives up to its promise, with a few stories that are quite interesting and engaging. However, for the most part it is quite dull and unengaging. The central character - Rue - is the main cause of the problem, coming across as superficial, self-absorbed and pretentious. In fact the whole series feels like that, though it might accurately describe teens' lives (!).As mentioned, some side-stories are interesting, but these are not enough to make this watchable.""
It's just almost halfway through first season but I can easily say this one of the best high school series I have ever seen. The direction and cinematography of this series is groundbreaking. All the performances are pitch perfect and Zendaya is simply one of the best young actresses. The series talks about many themes which are difficult to take but the creators did a great job. There's high rate of profanity which may trouble some but one can easily understand that it is needed for this series.

Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary \'Eggsy\' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world.

""The series, which runs for 10 episodes, is not an origin story although origins are important. The members of The Umbrella Academy are all grown up now, after a childhood spent in the limelight. One day in 1989, 43 babies were born to mothers who were not pregnant the day before. Seven of them were purchased by an eccentric billionaire, Sir Reginald Hargreeves , who trained them up as The Umbrella Academy to be crime fighters - and perhaps something more.There are a lot of characters presented all at once, but one of the The Umbrella Academy's many strengths is that it understands the importance of a good montage. Those, augmented by a killer soundtrack, help make everyone stand out and immediately recognizable.The Umbrella Academy is quick, quirky, and light, although there are real stakes and consequences that play out over the course of the season.It's frankly difficult to think back to how everything began in this crazy show after having buzzed through its 10 episodes, because it's so full of layered narratives. Don't look up spoilers, though - knowing less is more. Not having read the books, I can't speak to the Netflix series' success as an adaptation. But as a superhero-tinged TV show, it gets everything right. The Umbrella Academy is incredibly interesting, enjoyable, quirky, and well worth your time.""
""'the great point is the rehabilitation, in smart manner, carefully, of fairy tale genre. the clash between worlds, the delicate use of magic, the convincing script, the good acting makes things better episode by episode. the basic secret of its success - the desire to seduce not impress. and this ambition has a great role to transform in delight an old fashion story in which the ingredients of modern life are not pieces of adaptation but ladder to deep charm of childhood silhouettes. because it is obvious the respect for classic characters and for the high measure in scenes construction. a series with special flavor. and result of great ambition. remarkable work and useful alternative against blockbusters wave.'""

""'\'The Sinner\' is a strange drama, rather over-constructed. A woman commits an inexplicable crime, and has seemingly neither any understanding of what she has done, nor apparent interest in getting to the bottom of the case. But a detective, with relationship problems of his own, is interested, and eventually uncovers the story of her awful history and thereby explains the crime. But there\'s little feeling of urgency to the drama, little emotional connection to the characters and sadly little plausibility as well. It feels like someone was trying too hard to make a psychological thriller; but forgot that our psychological motivations are often most interesting when at their subtlest.'""
""'The show has a different atmosphere, darker and more intense than most of the superhero shows. While Supergirl, Smallville, Flash and such reminds me of teenage shows from 90\'s, Daredevil and Jessica Jones are more serious and more movie-like.

Electra and Punisher are a welcome refreshment, but still, I cannot give it more than strong 7.7/10'""
""'Daredevil is yet another excruciatingly dull, formulaic outing from the Marvel stable. After the awful Agents of Shield and its dismal spin off Agent Carter I had hoped we had seen the last of this cheesy comic book franchise. Sadly that was not to be the case. I should have known better but I took a look at Daredevil. Really there is not a lot to say. Classic US stick about a guy with traditional read conservative values turned vigilante with a hero complex. Like almost all of its counterparts, its driven by melodramatic, often corny, exposition. Forget about meaningful character development or interesting story lines, they are conspicuous by their absence. All in all if you are not selective in your viewing and like lots of guns, fighting and mindless noise, this might appeal to you. If, on the other hand you like interesting, engaging series I\'d give this one a pass. Two out of ten from me.'""
'There are so many superhero shows out there. But Daredevil is different and better in a few ways.The story remains understandable and simple. A viewer should not have to concentrate too hard to keep up with a TV show. 13 episodes means the story doesn\'t have to get repetitive and confusing like in Flash and Shield. Quality is better than quantity. 22 episodes is too much for some shows. One villain is more menacing than a new villain each week.The actors are good. Charlie Cox is a likable and understated actor. The hero is vulnerable and not infallible. Vincent d\'Onofrio is impressive as the villain of the season. His character is well developed. There may not be a bevy of beauties like Arrow but when the story is good it doesn\'t matter.A few faults. The lighting is too dark in some sequences. Things can move slowly in some parts. At first I thought the fighting is a bit too expert for a blind person even with powers. Some fight scenes are a bit too long.CW and ABC could learn from this show. Quality vs quantity. Looking forward to season 2.'
""IF you only watch the first few seasons it's pretty good. It actually starts off decent enough, and had they kept on that track I'd give it 10 stars.But, unfortunately, it spiraled into CW trash pretty fast and what was once a decent and gritty superhero show ala Grell, it quickly turned into Smallville meets The Dating Game.As the show progresses, it becomes more and more muted, more and more toned down, and the gritty darkness that made it good fun turned into shallow CWness.Watch the first few seasons, and then tune out.""

Action consists of lots of hand to hand combat so poorly performed even camera angles couldn\'t rescue the fake punches. Also added were the usual fighting sticks and toy store laser guns. 4. Really bad science (audience probably doesn\'t care or know better) dealing with time travel as if it were like walking out the door.

They eliminate applicants during the interview -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. Kingsman is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn\'t like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I\'m not a big fan of violence, but I\'ll put up with it for something like The Godfather - -- not for this.

""To compare this Star Trek series to any previous one is extremely difficult because this new show is very little like any of the previous shows. Now, instead of a one hour story that occasionally lasted several episodes, the show is essentially one long story...much like a soap opera or movie serial. Because of that, it's a tough show to watch here and there and it demands your attention each episode...something some viewers would no doubt not like. Additionally, the show is much darker and after the first half of season one, there is NOTHING that even remotely looks like comedy or even light drama. No, it's oppressive, dark and dim. On the positive side, it IS great looking...with effects that look as good as movies. But, Star Trek purists will no doubt be offended because this series is supposed to take place a decade before the first series from 1966-1969....yet the effects and technology seem hundreds of years ahead! Overall, it's a real mixed bag and I still honestly don't know what I think about it. Hard to rate and perhaps I'll come back to this review after I see more of how the story unfolds.UPDATE: After finishing the first season, I found I didn't hate nor love the series BUT feel it's best not to try comparing it to other Trek shows...it's THAT different. Instead, just accept it for what it is....and you'll likely enjoy it more.""
""For a light comedy, scrubs was good. However, it wasn't as funny and great as everyone claims. Maybe because the humour got old. The last seasons with the new setting and characters should not have been filmed at all, in addition. The bromance, however, was pretty good and the main character was interesting.""
""Scrubs is a show with 4 main leads but really it's the overall ensemble that makes it the great show that it is.The leads were J.D., Turk, Carla and Elliot. But you also had The Janitor, Kelso, Cox, The Todd, Nurse Laverne, Jordan, Snoop Dogg Intern and Dr. Beardface which helped makes the show so great. The characters play off of each other perfectly. The series wasn't afraid to poke fun at its main characters, like J.D. always drinking his Appletinis.After so many serious hospital shows like ER, Chicago Hope, St. Elsewhere, Hawthorne(which were all great shows), it's still nice to see a doctor show that doesn't take itself so serious. Not to say they made the doctors out to be clowns since they still really cared about their patients and saving them but they brought along humor to lighten the load when need be.""
""'Scrubs' was at the start a nice funny alternative to the more heavy medical shows like 'ER'. It made a star out of Zach Braff, and ran successfully for many series, without really ever setting the world alight.It was a modern comedy, so of course it's unfortunately a given that it's full of sex jokes and stupidity, but the charm of Braff and many other of the cast saves things slightly.The network knew it had a hit on its hands, so this show got milked until it was not funny It's a shame, because at its peak, this show was better than most.""

""'I must admit I\'m more into the DC Universe than the Marvel one and know nothing of the Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. comic, assuming there is one. Worse, I\'ve not even seen Avengers Assemble, so I guess I\'m not best qualified to review this highly publicised TV spin-off.However, taking it at face value, this was typical fast-moving American entertainment, even if it was pretty obviously not aimed at my demographic, I\'d wager. This episode sought to introduce the major characters who will appear regularly and even if, for the reasons stated above, the personnel and their back-stories lost me somewhat, the main story got through.With flashy, high-tech graphics, fine special effects, especially when Agent Coulson\'s car makes out like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the end and an easy to follow story, I was well- entertained in the fairly shallow way I expected. Sure some of the dialogue should have been screened extensively by the clichÃÂ©-cops and everyone\'s either being sarcastic or witty (they think), but there are some decent one-liners in there as you\'d hope.On the whole then, it\'s probably a bit too fast, flashy and loud for taste, but then again I\'m not much interested in comics from before 1980, so this was always gong to be a slightly awkward fit for me, but as trashy, disposable TV it\'s okay and I\'m confident that a major story-line will develop, as indeed I hope the rather large cast of characters do too.'""

I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this getting out of hand, being unrealistic/over the top.But that\'s it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it\'s always on some other level flying around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don\'t mind this being British to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you\'ll enjoy this.

Very underrated actor. And Janet is quite a creative, talented actress; and the character certainly one of the best elements here and adds a lot to the comedy and quality of the show.The series does well early on seizing the attention of the viewer as it unpacks its roller-coaster of a tale with seemingly endless twists and surprises. Ironically, the twist-laden first couple of seasons seem to stuff the viewer to the point where nothing seems surprising or unexpected anymore, and it could be said the first couple of seasons defeat the last couple of seasons at that. The end seems a bit nihilistic all in all, and somehow, that doesn\'t come as a surprise given the everything goes tone of the series.The subtext is appreciable at times, but the socio-political/religious implications certainly less.

This is a truly riveting show, brilliantly acted, highly photogenic, and displaying all the professionalism and angst from the investigative side seamlessly contrasted with all heartache and tension of those around the identity of the killer, and the cold ice star of the killer himself.'""
""Sure, there are some coincidences here and there that feel a little too contrived (for instance: what are the odds of Paul taking so much time in Stella's hotel room ÃÂ¡nd Jim coming by that very night?), but the big pluses of this series make me very forgiving.I loved the dark atmosphere of the whole (a fierce serial killer who pretends to be a good father played very well by Jamie Dornan^, good 'old' Gillian Anderson as a somewhat troubled investigator, Belfast itself), even when the first season seemed a little more intense than the second. As far as all the issues that were addressed go, 'The fall' takes on a whole lot, but never strays too far from the main story.It's been a while since a TV-series drew me in like this one did, and I'm really looking forward to a new season, ÃÂ¡nd watching the first two again not before long!9 out of 10.^ Didn't know he also did the lead in 'FiShOGr', but there it is...""
""'one of series who are, in profound sense, special. or different. or unexpected. or great. or surprising. because it is not exactly the crime series who could be familiar. it is not the psychological drama who propose mysteries and solutions and brave heroes. it is a gray story about ordinary people, in a Belfast who has the chance to be any town. a precise picture, almost too neutral, about vulnerable people, about a case and about a hunt with double sense. and this small facts transforms it in a admirable work. because it has the chance to be a trip among cold slices of reality.'""
""It's not necessary to ask the actors do the straight, gay or lesbian love-making, intercourse scenes, totally unnecessary. Viewers who appreciated this series don't actually needed those stuff. Asking these actors doing these unnecessary love-making scenes was not kind to them, 'cause it's the on-going interviews of the extremely violent, vicious, twisted-minded serial killers and the gradual development of the profiling science of the FBI that interested us, not the licking, grinding, kissing love-making sexual scenes between the straight or the lesbian persons motivated us to watch this series.The 2nd season spent too much episodes on the Atlanta serial killing investigation, I was a bit getting tired of these episodes. I also sympathize the actors who in order to show how people chain-smoking in the 60s, 70s and 80s, they had to smoke so many cigarettes in every episode, hope them won't get lung cancers after this drama series. Those who did the supporting roles in all the episodes, either smoking or inhaling the 2nd handed cigarette smoke in the restaurants, all the public places, in the airplane cabins, Jesus, what a disgust and shameful scene to watch.All the actors did superb fantastic acting jobs, salute! The scenes of 70s, the settings just looked so real, absolutely impeccable. This is a very serious and honest production, I salute to all of the people and praise them did a great job. Awaiting and craving the 3rd Season. I'm a fan.""
""'Sometimes you watch a show, just to check it out and see what it\'s about and discover all these great things about it. I came across Mindhunter, a friend recommended it to me, he suggested I gave it a try and so I did, and I have to say this is some of the most amazing things I\'ve seen. It\'s not just a show it\'s an episodic movie, placed in many chapters and sequences with very intricate character development and incredibly well acted, well produced and well written. The biographical elements are woven into it\'s rich fictional plot and made to seem as accurate as possible. The way the serial killers\' minds work, the whole show is about that basically, it\'s a personification of these sequence killers as it was known back then, it\'s brilliant, kitschy and very very intense. David Fincher really created a masterpiece here and this is practically an addition to the plethora of reasons why 21st century Fincher is a tier ahead of the 20th century Fincher, he\'s exploring different mediums and that is a really good way to tell more stories in different ways with very well developed cores and characters with as much experimentation that he can do with his limited script.'""
""I'm beyond fascinated by the study of the criminals as weird as they may sound so this hit the spot to me kinda like a delicious meal! The other thing is David Fincher the director of the pilot is one of my all time favorite humans/famous beings! Mindhunter has a wonderful tranquil ambient soundtrack throughout and immersive acting. It'll creep you out, intrigue you, and even make you wanna sympathize with many of the characters.Also I'm rewatching for the second time, I originally saw when back in its prime and loving every bit again, I'm sure season 2 is just as good; I'll watch that soon. They're needs to be a lot more adult crime shows rated TV-MA, it's a million times better than most! Highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind learning about monsters that did sinister crimes!""
""Clever, hilarious comedy.A behind-the-scenes look at the the cast and crew of The Girly Show (TGS), an NBC skit-comedy program. Centres on the executive producer of the show, Liz Lemmon (played by Tina Fey), her boss, GE/NBC executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).Created by Tina Fey, of SNL fame, 30 Rock is incredibly clever, especially in its references to topical events and in poking fun at the entertainment industry. Quite over-the-top at times, and delightfully so. The jokes come thick and fast, sometimes too fast - you've hardly digested one and the next one is upon you. If there is a negative, that is it - with the humour being so clever, you need some breathing space to sometimes get the jokes and being so snappy, you can easily miss things.Great performances and perfect casting. Alec Baldwin probably has the toughest gig, as his character is right-wing and capitalist to the extreme and is a living parody of not just the entertainment industry but business executives in general. Also, before this Baldwin was really considered only a drama-movie actor, so this is quite a change for him. He carries it off with aplomb.A classic and classy comedy series.""
""30 Rock is a show that you either love or hate. The comedy is very subjective and has stayed true to it's own style for all 7 seasons. I initially thought it was a bit ridiculous and rather childish but then it started to grow on me. Now I officially count myself in the love category. I'm very impressed with Tiny Fey, she truly is very talented and I commend her for creating a show that is unashamed to be funny, intelligent and stupid all at the same time.Now that I am finally in the seventh season I think they made the right decision to go out on a high before the show had a chance to become too old and tired. If you still haven't watched any of the episodes then it is never too late. You may be pleasantly surprised and end up binge watching until the very last episode like I did. I highly recommend it.""
""I have heard a lot of great things about this show, that it is one of the best laugh out loud comedies out there and so on and so forth..... I have never been more disappointed...I thought season 1 was a bit slow like The Office or Parks and Recreations and I held on until season 2 and 3 but after watching 3 episodes in season 3 i could not suffer it any more. I have tried really hard to like this but I didn't even SMILE once, I am not even talking about laughing, I couldn't even force a smile because of how bad it is. This is by far the most overrated show in the history of TV shows and I have watched around 80 different ones""

""'Five seasons in, BoJack Horseman continues to be one of the most complex, thought-provoking and funny animated shows.Season five revolves around BoJack\'s (Will Arnett) new crime show Philbert, and blossoming relationship with co-star Gina (Brooklyn Nine-Nine\'s Stephanie Beatriz). Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) juggles a busy producing career and the prospect of becoming a new mother, there\'s the fallout from Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter\'s divorce, and Todd (the always amazing Aaron Paul) somehow becomes CEO of a big corporation - before being superseded by his home-made sex robot Henry Fondle (whose pre-programmed phrases provides the answers that his employees want). In an often heavy show, Todd\'s levity and crazy hijinks provide vital balance as well as the clever sight gags that\'s become a tradition.The highlight of season five is \'Free Churro\'; it\'s a 25-minute monologue by BoJack at his mother\'s funeral. In these 25 minutes, BoJack\'s complex relationship with his mother unravels, from her final words to him and the random act of kindness to BoJack from a fast food employee. Watching one person talk for 25 minutes flies against the short attention span of most viewers, but it works and Arnett should get some sort of award for it.\nWhile season five continues to expose BoJack\'s many flaws (and constant self-loathing), it ends on an optimistic note, thanks to some help from Diane.A must-watch for BoJack fans.'""

He must have spent a good portion of his youth watching every possible rerun. LOL Catching and figuring them all out can be a pretty good game for the viewer all by itself.I truly think that the USA Network is consistently putting out the best new programming around. This is a pleasant contrast to the Sci-Fi Network, which is doing its best to buy up and budget kill anything that threatens to be good sci-fi.The three series from USA that we watch religiously (Psych, Monk, and Burn Notice) is a larger count than the combined shows we watch from the original big 3 .... combined.Keep up the good work, USA, and we\'ll keep watching!'""

""'I never liked Monk very much. But from the instant this show came on right after it, I knew USA finally had something. This has to be one of the best shows ever made-- if not, then definitely one of the top comedies. It combines dramedy, mystery, the buddy dynamic, and pineapples. It\'s got lots of witty references, from Airwolf to Smokey & the Bandit, and it features two main characters (Shawn, played by James Roday, and Gus, played by Dule Hill) who make a great duo all-around, from their great chemistry to their playful A-B Club ethics. Corbin Bernsen shakes things up as Shawn\'s tough-as-nails ex-cop dad. Kirsten Nelson deserves some sort of Emmy for her take on police chief Karen Vick. And as the anti-Shawn-and-Gus, Timothy Omundson and Maggie Lawson are fantastic (Lawson was a replacement after the pilot episode for the equally phenomenal Anne Dudek, who played a woman named Precious in an episode of Friends). This show has it all-- the humor is spot-on, the mysteries just keep improving with age, and I think we\'ll always be drawn to a show about a slacker with a heart of gold... and fake psychic abilities.'""
""'I haven\'t read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and Hammer time to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!'""

""'Interestingly, the idea for the movie that led to the creation of this show is a stone tablet called the Byblos Calligary discovered in 1928 that shows a still unidentified language that predates, some think, the earliest examples of written language on Earth. Very interesting. That the show is a blatant nod to the military, is just plain depressing. Just more SF flap doodle that really goes nowhere except to generate more shows in a similar vein that are equally unwatchable for anyone with half a mind. That gotta hurt. Really, I think it is bad SF. All bad SF has a combination of three elements, an unexplained artifact, followed by teams of military people followed by perplexed aliens fighting the previously mentioned military persons.Nothing new there, and nothing new here, except that they have been doing it unflaggingly for years now to the point the old bad has become the new good. For that, it deserves a Brooklyn Cheer. This show and its spin offs deserve to go the way of Space 1999, and UFO, both truly bad SF shows that were put out of their misery long ago, to the benefit of all.'""

""Showtime, with its addition of Outer Limits and Total Recall - the Series, has done more for original s.f. programming than the Sci Fi Channel. However, Showtime's crowning achievement is Stargate SG-1, a well-developed s.f. series that takes an okay movie and takes it much further.  The characters are well-rounded, various aspects of their galactic travel are explored, there is a wide range of continuing plotlines and costarring characters.  After a somewhat rocky start in the first half of the first season, as they hit all of the standard s.f. cliches (a character ages, they visit a parallel universe, they land on a planet where the female character must combat anti-feminism), they've broadened quite a bit, expanding the backstory of the Stargate itself, the enemy (the Gou'ald), and Earth's role to come.  Highly entertaining, with great performances by Richard Dean Anderson and Christopher Judge in particular.  Catch it now that it's in syndication, if you don't get Showtime.""
""The 1990's was a mediocre time for sci-fi series in my opinion. Stargate SG-1 was one of the few good series.Like so many good shows what helped Stargate SG-1 was it's awesome cast; Richard Dean Anderson as Col. O' Neill, Amanda Tapping as Captain/Major Carter, Michael Shanks as Dr. Jackson, Don S. Davis as Major General Hammond and Christopher Judge as Teal'c.All the characters are brilliant. The chemistry between them is great. Some of the Stargate SG-1 plots have been a little bit weak but you wouldn't notice because of the brilliant cast. The SG-1 team kind of remind me of The A-Team from the 80's because they stick together, they're good friends outside work and they always do the right things.The villains in this series could rival many of the villains from Star Trek. We have had the SG-1 team fighting the likes of the G'ouald and the replicators. The storylines have been consistently good throughout.All in all, this is a good series. My only criticism is the fact that the talented Teryl Rothery who plays Dr. Frasier hasn't had any good storylines of her own.""

It is 1960 and Midge is branching out to do shows outside of Manhattan, and even goes to Vegas to work with a more well-known entertainer, a fictional singer, Shy Baldwin.I watch the show because Rachel Brosnahan is so good as Mrs. Maisel, 'Midge'. She is far from perfect, she gets divorced and doesn't seem to care much what happens to her two kids, often being cared for by the grandparents who have their own issues. I really like Tony Shalhoub as her dad, Professor Abe Weissman.Also really good is Alex Borstein as short, spineless Susie Myerson, a friend who serves as her manager, rarely taking a strong stand on anything but needs the 10% she gets from her clients. She has a very funny style about her, her character is a goofball in a very nice way. But I also must say her overly dirty mouth gets tiresome quickly.The late-1950s, early 1960s is done very well, that was the period when I was a teenager so it brings back good memories of a simpler time.""

""Sex and the City (1998-2004) is one of my absolute favorites for many reasons. First off, it sports an incredible cast! Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, Kim Cattrall plays Samantha Jones, Cynthia Nixon is Miranda Hobbes, and Kristin Davis plays Charlotte York. The casting is spot on, every actress plays their character perfectly. It's true that they're all a joy to watch, Samantha Jones is my personal favorite, she's truly hilarious and just when you think she can't think about anything other than casual sex, she surprises you with her big heart. I love that each character has their own style and they are so different as people, yet they fit together perfectly as a friend group. The writing is just great. It is full of witty, hilarious humor, touching moments between these well developed characters, and it's all pulled together by the great chemistry that hovers over the whole show. Another thing I love is how real the show is, especially about sex. All is revealed. The dialogue is uncensored and that works for the show. Overall, this is a very entertaining, well written show that I definitely suggest! 10/10.""

The moral or thesis of the show is the female characters are too self-absorbed with their own feeling, jobs etc they leave no room for a real relationship. Throwing oneself sexually is never going create a healthy longterm relationship. I believe the show either displays the selfish silliness or that the characters really do not want a man.

""'A crime drama about the rise (and falls) of Detective James Gordon in the years while Bruce Wayne grows into Batman, told in parallel from the angle of Gordon himself, from the angle of young Wayne, as well as from the angles of important players of the Gotham underworld.Initially a combination of gangster and buddy-cop genres, as convincing and realistic as possible for the DC universe, the series later grows into an SF superhero (or supervillain, as they are in majority and much more fun) madness with countless plots and subplots. However, although it may be a bit over-the-top, the series does not lose its direction and not a single ark remains incomplete.The complex multi-layered story, which does not get lost in its complexity, brings us the origins stories of Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Catwoman, and many other well-known characters of the Batman universe, and introduces some new, equally good ones. The strongest asset of the series is the great variety of compelling characters with excellent characterization (no black-and-white division between good and evil) and the evolution of their relationships. The cast is top-notch, and I especially have to single out the wicked and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith, the best Penguin ever played by Robin Lord Taylor, Cory Michael Smith as Riddler, and Cameron Monaghan as the Joker whose creepiness is unlikely to ever be matched, let alone exceeded.8/10.'""

What's worse is that from where they left off and when they come back, there's no explanation for the missing timeline. E.g. Erin Richards' character and especially Jada Pinkett Smith's character.

Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio\'s cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the \'60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn\'t Steven Spielberg\'s best movie by any stretch, but it\'s sure a neat one. There is one scene that\'s probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Cool.'""
""I'm not entirely finished with the second season, but it doesn't matter as of now. The show's incredibly consistent, totally and utterly entertaining and so easily watchable. The ensemble is amazing, possibly one of TV's finest ever, and the series does a great mix between both comedy and drama. The character development is aces, and it never ceases to surprise you with the character turns and developments. Taylor Schilling is wonderful in the title role, and even better in the second season. This is strongly recommended, and as of now Netflix's best show, surpassing House of Cards. It has tighter writing and a better handle on the story lines.""
""Unlike the other Marvel/Netflix shows, The Punisher doesn't suffer from too much filler, or glacial pacing. It moves and Jon Berenthal dominates the screen. Yes it is violent. Yes he is revenge driven. But he has a reason and the reason is always clear. The supporting cast is very good, and for those who care, very diversified. The man who betrays him and who Frank turns into Jigsaw is a worthy adversary. But in the end, the show is propelled by Berenthal, who also overshadowed the second season of Daredevil.""
""The Punisher is a fresh and entertaining show. For those who love violence, hand to hand combat and realism this show is for you. The Punisher has a somewhat slow start in that it gives you a loose picture of what the story is driven by and what Frank Castle is driven by. In the first few minutes you see him take revenge on those people who killed his family. The show looks at the wider conspiracy as to why they were murdered. The conspiracy is pulled off well and the cast deliver some solid performances. Jon Bernthal was born for this role and pulls it off with ease. The only criticism is the one dimensional nature of the show with Frank and the rest of the cast. There is no irony, poetic justice and depth beyond the 'eye for an eye' story which could have taken it to new heights but this is that bit extra that I personally might have liked. But nevertheless it doesn't reduce the quality or intensity of the show and it still makes for excellent viewing. Highly recommended, I can't wait for season 2. \n8/10""
""'What a cracking series. Super violent, heroic, and honorable. In the vein of Old Boy and other great Asian crime flicks. Honestly one of the few Hollywood attempts that can match the best Chinese, Japanese and Korean products.Rollicking great fun and yet, amidst all the over the top violence, gore and general mayhem, the creators have still managed to piece together a strong storyline, compelling characters and perhaps even an empathy with the baddies.Definitely not to be missed if you like the Hong Kong crime and gang genre.'""

""This is one of those series you hope they will never get canceled. All the actors are funny, the script must have been written when they were on something, it's hilarious. Each character plays his stereotype at his best. The whole Bluth family has some serious issues but they seem to function like that. My favorite characters are Tobias FÃÂ¼nke, Buster Bluth and George-MichaÃÂ«l Bluth even though I like all the other characters as well. The whole family is so messed up it's too funny for words. I was really surprised when they picked up the series again after seven years for another season and hoped it would have last longer. Everybody looked more or less the same except for Portia De Rossi that turned from a beautiful women to some strange creature which only proves that you should not mess with your looks and don't use plastic surgery. A must watch!""

""Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool.""

""One of those rare shows that have been popping up which uses a non-traditional presentation -- jiggly camera, frequent yet hilarious voice-overs from Ron Howard, bizarre sight gags, among other elements -- ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT became the big hit with critics and award shows alike even if the ratings were not the best, perhaps because of its time slot and competition with DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.In its short time on the air it's demonstrated that wackiness and eccentricity in a family pay off, especially when the writing is almost too good for its own good and the situations are so off the wall they actually, gleefully go over it. An ensemble cast that while initially may not say quality since many have had checkered careers in both films and television or are relative unknowns, nevertheless everyone without singling out any actor in particular is at their utmost, quirky best, the story lines are not only crazy to begin with but getting better by the edition, and the hopes that this show will not be prematurely canceled or moved into cable TV -- ARRESTED could fare excellently on HBO if FOX decided to axe it.Uncompromising and outrageously hysterical while at the same time smart and sharp, this is one show that should not be missed.""
""Excellent film depicting the Atlantic City area during the beginning of Prohibition in 1920.Am wondering if Steve Buscemi will be up to playing suave gangster Nukki Thompson in this series.It appears that director Martin Scorsese and others associated with this production have all totally captured the period. The set decorations seem to be excellent.We see that Nukki can actually have a heart in his treatment of Mrs. Schroeder, of course the fact that he has had Mr. Schroeder killed is something else.The film is very interesting in that it takes us to the beginnings of the illustrious careers of Arnold Rothstein and Al Capone.Corruption is wide-spread throughout Atlantic City. Even Thompson addresses a meeting of the Lady's Temperance Society at the film's beginning.As this part ends, we see the linking of Atlantic City to Chicago for violating the Volstead Act. The film is immediately showing that the latter act was so much more trouble than what it was worth.""
""'I gave this a chance until the second season when the slow moving action just ground to a halt midway through the season. The story seems to wander about aimlessly, flailing around to try and stop it from drowning. Each episode just seemed to be more and more like a theme park or elaborate costume set but without a very substantive story. I just could not connect with the characters like I did with The Sopranos where the characters really drew you into their story. In this series, the characters were like figures from history where you knew the names but they had no flesh to them at all. This, coupled with the slow moving story just lead to a complete loss of interest in the characters and the story. Steve Buscemi\'s portrayal did not fit the character at all, instead coming across like a caricature. He did not seem able to move through the range of emotions that would bring depth and credibility to the character. I think this series was hyped way beyond it\'s reality!'""
""If i remember right, an important detail in marketing Boardwalk Empire has been the involvement of Martin Scorcese and Mark Wahlberg as executive producers. There were others, but not as important as these two.Now, Scorcese's projects in the past decade or so ranged between barely watchable (Gangs of New York) over mediocre flicks (Wolf of Wall Street) to exciting dramas (Shutter Island, The Departed) and even nice documentaries (George Harrison: Living in the Material World). Judging by this track record, Boardwalk Empire could have been anywhere between a disaster and a masterpiece.Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, has been the man behind Entourage, one of the lamest TV shows i've seen. But i didn't want to be judgmental and gave Boardwalk Empire a try.Probably the most important thing is to understand that Boardwalk Empire successfully interweaves facts with fiction. Looking at the storyline, each season kicked off rather uneventful and roughly after the first half the writers changed gears and headed toward the finale. The series is laced with violence and a fair amount of gore and female nudity. It would be interesting to understand whether the viewers wanted to see those three or the producers decided that it would be good idea to focus on them.Needless to say, the hype surrounding Boardwalk Empire was very strong, although the product was mediocre.""
""I've watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this series, and well, ummm, okay, it got kind of redundant after a while, didn't it? Much like the plot in a porno is just enough to string the sex scenes together, the plot in this movie is just to string the sex and violence scenes together.Spartacus is a Thracian betrayed by his Roman allies, and sent to a gladiator ludus. But most of the series isn't about him, it's about the machinations of the Ludus owner, Batiates, and his wife, Xena, Lesbian Princess. Or whatever. So all of this involves complicated plots leading up to fights in the arena punctuated by gratuitous sex scenes...And, yes, the battle scenes look way too much like 300.""
""If you enjoy naked, sweaty men grappling each other, this is for you. Full frontal nudity: Crixus standing there while a patrician Roman woman inspected his goods was a little too much. Shaved pubic hair and the black skin of his penis is a sure indicator of steroid abuse. We have characters alternately speaking like Shakespeare and then hurling obscenities as if they were on an inner city bus after the local ghetto school was let out. Soft core porn of men doing women, men doing men, and women doing women and you pretty much see what this is really about. Extremely phony fight scenes where gladiators fight on after losing 40% of their blood... This has nothing to do with Spartacus - it's just a revolting exploitation vehicle. I stopped watching it. What's up with the signature scene, appearing in each episode, where a gladiator gets whacked in the face, his head spins around, and a pint of blood splashes out of his mouth? Then he always continues as if nothing had happened, without so much as a swollen lip.""
""Spartacus (Andy Whitfield/Liam McIntyre) was a Thracian who refused to fight after being lied to by Roman commander Claudius Glaber. He is enslaved as well as his wife Sura. He is eventually purchased by Batiatus (John Hannah) as he is thrown into the world gladiators. The house of Batiatus is full of intrigue led in part by his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless). He would rebel and bring Rome to the brink.It's a Starz production. It's blood splattering gore. It's full on sexuality. The violence is over the top. The fights are slow motion poetry. The story is human depravity at its finest. The show took a look at any restrictions and laughed at its face. The first season ends with the breakout of the House of Batiatus. Andy Whitfield was Spartacus. However he got sick, and the show next did a six-part prequel without Whitfield. When he died, the show continues with Liam McIntyre as Spartacus.If this was a simple exploitation fare, I wouldn't rate it so high. The story is just so fun. John Hannah and Lucy Lawless really have a lot of fun playing the devious duo. The twists and turns come fast and furious. It's like an earlier 'Game of Thrones' with more nudity. The last season is hamstrung by the fact that it's history that Spartacus dies.""

""A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7.""
""Narcos was a great and in a way emotional adventure trip that broke my heart. Despite many violence and bloody scenes it offers top entertainment and non stop adrenaline. The best I liked was the very excellent performance of Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal and all the other actors that played their roles cool and very credible. I want to thank all of you, each of you deserved an Oscar or other kind of awards. I am thinking already to watch it again. The intro song is always very nice to hear. It gives those mini series the right atmosphere and kick to start the Narcos thrill. 10/10. If you liked this genre of series you shouldn't miss Breaking Bad.""
""This is by far the best thing I ever saw about the life of Pablo Escobar and the Colombian crisis. Everything in this show is perfect. The actors are sublime, every actor is very believable in his role. The narrating voice through the whole series works really well to me. Also the real video fragments from the news in that time between the fiction works really well. I was completely addicted to this show after the first episode. I saw the whole season in a couple days. Can't wait for season two honestly. If all series would be at the same level as this one I would probably never set a foot outside anymore and just watch television all day. Narcos will definitely be the show of the year. Great job from Netflix!""
""'The production values of Narcos are quite high, and the acting very good. Pablo Escobar was larger than life, and his story is fascinating, so anyone setting out to portray it gets a huge head start. Wild and amazing, yet true! I have watched a couple other Escobar depictions, and this one focuses on the DEA officers involved in his pursuit and take down.My only substantive complaint is that the narration is excessive and unnecessary. It would have been possible to dramatize most of what was said by the narrators, and in some cases the narration was insulting to the viewer as it was evident from the images on the screen what was going on. I am not sure why directors are insisting on using this technique. It works for some films but is sometimes annoying, as in this case.The unwanted overvoice narration notwithstanding, Narcos is overall very good.'""
""'This was a very good animated series. At first, one could think that it is something like Ben 10 (Read: an American cartoon that tries too hard to imitate the visual style and characterization from anime series) but I ended liking this series. The animation is nice and detailed, the characters are interesting and have a great development while the plot advances, the storyline is complex and very well made, full of action, drama, comedy and mystery. Many of the elements of the story seem to be influenced by the mythology of China and India, and the result is simply incredible. The writers managed very well to keep the plot interesting, from the very beginning until the end. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best cartoons ever produced by Nickelodeon, along with Invader Zim, Rocko and Ren & Stimpy (Despite being completely different to those series) I highly recommend to anyone.10/10'""

""Avatar: The Last Airbender deserves some serious credit for introducing a new generation to the anime genre. It is extremely hard to not enjoy this series. It has lovable characters, real dangers, plot development, perfectly-timed comedy and a really well thought out storyline.This series is perfectly suited to adults and children alike. Don't kid yourself there are serious issues dealt with but many children will miss those themes and will just appreciate the comedy.If you find yourself enjoying this series then I also recommend you watch The Legend of Korra too. Korra is much darker than Avatar but just as entertaining and intelligent.""

As great as Timothy Olyphant is as playing the Raylan Givens character he's made better by having a good character like Walton Goggins' character Boyd Crowder to play off of.In season one Boyd was in the pilot which was a great pilot but then because of other obligations Goggins didn't return until later that season. And while the non Boyd episodes of Justified were still decent TV they weren't as great as when Boyd returned to the show. The show without Boyd was just a villain of the week type of show. But with Boyd back on the show was much more of a serial show were the story lines carrier over from week-to-week instead of being selt contained episodes.
""'Justified had real promise when it first started. It wasn\'t just a cop show, but also a bit of a Western. with old-fashioned lawman Raylan Givens chasing down modern fugitives. He\'s kind of a dick, but the best kind: a charming one. And Timothy Olyphant was (is) perfect for this role. But just beyond that first season, the show became serialized and blossomed into an honest-to-god crime drama. This is exactly why it became one of my all-time favorite TV shows; it was quietly riveting week-in and week-out. But it was also a world full of entertaining characters and a cast to match. Walton Goggins proved to be Olyphant\'s equal as his primary opposition (and a show highlight), and this Kentucky underworld is one I often couldn\'t wait to return to. Put simply, it\'s an Elmore Leonard joint, complete with his ear- candy dialog and offbeat characters; and that\'s enough for me. But they went and made it one of the funniest, engaging and rewarding shows I\'ve ever seen. 10/10'""

Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this.

There probably is one, but the show is so dull, and the characters so dull and unrecognizable, that you couldn't possibly care.Sad to think that a hundred years from now, some future soul will watch this and think the seventies decade was anything like this. It wasn't. It's written and performed by Hollywood brats who have more control and power than they should. They abuse their control with giving us their lack of inspiration over and over.Such is the case with this pathetic show.

But thankfully all the crappy 70\'s nostalgia was kept pretty much to a minimum and it thankfully allowed the characters some breathing room (this is why the polar opposite That 80\'s Show failed dismally). Sadly after 3 or 4 seasons the show became a pale parody of itself culminating in a simply unwatchable 8th season. If the show only lasted half that long it would\'ve been fine with me. That 70\'s show was never anywhere close to classic in any way, shape, or form and other comedies of the \'90\'s could and did run circles around it, but in the beginning seasons it was a fun enough time waister.

It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run, especially Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He was my favorite character. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on FX for fans of the show to see for a long time.'""

""'I\'m amazed at the ratings associated with this show. To my mind its title pretty much sums it up, The Leftovers. Its a rather uninspiring mish mash of a range of well worn ideas, reminiscent of shows like Lost, Legion, The 4400 and others where something is amiss. People either appear or in this case disappear without obvious cause. Is it Angels, ET\'s? I\'d be inclined to say who cares. After two tedious episodes where nothing really happens aside from an odd ball cult who all dress like 1950\'s milkmen/asylum orderlies with a smoking habit and a vow of silence I\'d had enough. The rest is horribly formulaic too, the cop with a predictable drinking problem, wife and daughter issues, son hanging around with yet another cult. You get the idea. The acting is alright but there were no stand out performance\'s on offer that I could see either. Not surprising as this show provided me with scant inspiration. Five out of ten.'""
""I know the idea has been done before but The Mentalist delivers where others were lacking. I am very impressed with the direction of the show and all the elements seem to gel exceptionally well. The cast is definitely what makes this series successful. They're all interesting, have their individual quirks and make you want to like them. Simon Baker is fantastic as the aloof yet triumphant consultant and Robin Tunney is a great contrast to his character as the witty no- nonsense senior agent for the CBI.Every week they seem to come up with new and fresh ideas for the show which keeps it from feeling stale. And because of the personal back-stories that are continually evolving you understand the motives behind the characters decisions. A truly unique comedy/crime/drama show.""
""'Not in my opinion. Aside from the fact that both shows incorporate a psychic in the lead role the two shows have nothing to do with one another. If anything, The Mentalist is what Psych would have been if it had ever grown up. Psych is a lightweight comedy compared to The Mentalist. That\'s not to say that Psych doesn\'t have its merits, but it\'s not in the same league as the Mentalist, IMO.The problem with The Mentalist isn\'t that it\'s a copy of Psych, it\'s that it starts off great and then fizzles, like too many other shows. I\'ve rarely seen a show with this degree of inconsistency. While binge watching it on cable there were entire episodes that were so out of touch I simply fast forwarded through 90% of the show. That happened several times.Compounding that were glaring plot holes that you could drive a truck through. And suspension of disbelief was stretched beyond reasonable limits. It\'s a shame. A show that started out cutting edge with a cast that worked well together devolved into a mess that was indistinguishable from the first season. Too bad. It had a lot of potential.'""
""Okay, there are just way too many crime dramas on television these days. I prefer sitcoms. I think the partnership of Simon Baker and Robin Tunney is interesting. They have a lot of chemistry on screen. Apart from the actual crime solving on the shows, Simon's character is a mentalist or a fake psychic or fraud charlatan before he became an investigator and working on the right side instead of the wrong side. The mentalists are not exactly psychics but people who are very in tuned with details almost obsessively. While there are people out there who are skeptics about psychics and paranormal, there are legitimate psychics who don't exactly make a living from their gift but share with others. The mentalist doesn't believe in psychics exist but I disagree. I think there are some things that are just beyond explanation. I wish well for the Mentalist but it has too much competition already.""
""'Crime investigation television series do try hard in order to find an interesting theme to accompany the crimes with. Jane\'s story though is quite entertaining, that his case alone would have made a good show. I actually can\'t believe that the Red John case took so long and still had me hooked till the last minute. And even after that, the two seasons after RJ were good as well. Maybe it\'s because Jane has a unique way with dealing with the cases he has to solve. And it is really interesting to watch him read his suspects and create his plots. The romantic part though wasn\'t that good; it was more awkward than interesting. So, 6 out of 10.'""
""for a fan of Christian Bale, American Psycho is a real challenge. because his Paul Bateman seems be perfect. the mixture of cold cruelty, dark humor, the violence as error, the fall and the cynical speeches, the spirit of novel who becomes large, dark shadow who defines as parable the every day events, the almighty monster who is so vulnerable than the compassion of the viewer becomes , scene by scene, more deep, the sex scenes who are memorable, the run from himself in the cage of appearances, all is seductive, strange and bizarre . and convincing because it is only portrait of social crisis who defines us. a film who could be useful for discover the dark side from yourself. and an admirable Christian Bale's job.""
""Patrick Jane helps the CBI, led by Lisbon to find the guilty using his special talent to read people. At the same time he searches for the killer known as 'Red John', whose responsible for the murder of Jane's wife and child.I watch this show on a Friday after a long hard day of college, I laugh and laugh at Jane's exploits, his mannerisms, his quirky nature and his charming nature. More importantly, Jane is supported by the double act that is Kimbal Cho and Wayne Rigsby, they are just plain out funny, having their little banter between drives from crime scenes, Van Pelt adds the awkwardness that is simply hilarious, when she is around Rigsby.For me the hook was the end of the pilot, when we realise Red John history with Jane, simply stunning....One of the finest scenes I've ever seen.The one thing that does concern me, is the length of the Red John mystery, viewers may grow bored of the endless clues and near-misses to catch the serial killer....But, I'll always keep watching....""
""It is an end of an era, more or less. Bravo, they did a great job ending it, even though they still haven't really ended it. Well, I stopped watching so it ended for me. Seriously, the guys behind Naruto should just end it. Baruto looks promising but give us a break already, stop milking beloved franchises into the ground. Dragonball Super made a joke out of the DBZ universe and Baruto could do just the same thing to Naruto. Anyway, if you are planning on watching this series or watching it again then I recommend doing what I did, skipping all of the filler episodes. Seriously, a fillerless viewing of this show is literally animated art as far as I am concerned.""

""'This was just wonderful! Only complaints are the way they got rid of Madara , the inclusion of the Otsutsuki rabbit woman and that Sasuke and Naruto were reincarnations of those 2 guys i forgot their names.

Not what I'm looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
""'The film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. I know places and people that might pass for the world in The Killing. I have witnessed people fall apart because of those around them. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is effective. This is the kind of film that truly proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people. All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, with violent dogs barking everywhere.'""
""'Upon first learning of the AMC series The Killing I was a little confused since Stanley Kubrick directed a heist-themed movie with that title. But this is a really impressive series. Adapted from the Danish series Forbrydelsen, it focuses on a Seattle police detective (Mireille Enos) investigating a murder amid a political campaign. Various and sundry secondary and tertiary characters assist in the investigation. There\'s a little bit more revealed on each episode, but never so much that it gives away the whole plot. The result is a very good show. I do hope to see the original Danish series.* *Other US series based on foreign series were All in the Family, Sanford and Son and Ugly Betty.'""
""Like a parody of the genre, only to be taken seriously. First season was entertaining and intriguing enough, then it all went to unintentionally funny territory when characters became stereotypical, the acting subpar and the script, silly and convoluted. Complex for no real reasons. I stopped counting the number of times I thought I could end watching the series there, and not feel sorry about it. But I can't. There are no real appeal left to the story, once the conspiracy ÃÂ« thickens ÃÂ». And seeing Mireille Enos trying to look serious and lost in her own thoughts, every ten seconds, gets old really fast. It was awkward, as if she was feeling sick or something. Maybe she did, who knows...""
""'I see fan boys are out in full force for this show even though it ended in 2011. The show was never too my liking and I collected all these comic books, The Flash, Superman, Batman and Aquaman to name just a few.I\'m a traditionalist. I do not care for this teenybopper show. It has all the characters from Clark\'s later life all crammed in to one Smallville. Lex doesn\'t show up until much later in Clark\'s adult life. The same with all the other superheroes and supervillains. None of them were in SmallvilleThe show really is about grabbing two demographics, teens and fanboys. The show is always geared around a few male and female shots of abs or breasts/asses. It has a weak story with deus ex machina in ever single episode. You have more kryptonite in this one small town that you have in the entire Universe, yet kryptonite is supposed to be extremely rare.Overall this show deserves Golden Raspberry awards for every actor, director, writer and episode. It\'s just a crappy show made for immature people.Your boos mean nothing, I\'ve seen what makes you cheer!'""
""American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film directed by Mary Harron based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the title. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, ChloÃÂ« Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece.""
""'Smallville': right. Aptly named because it's exceedingly small on every issue of entertainment. Casting, acting, script, originality; you name it, you've seen it all before. It's as by-the-numbers as a cake recipe.This is the epitome of modern made-for-TV American dross. It's one of an increasing number of shows from the States (and sadly, also from Britain, now) that you can actually watch and follow with the sound turned off. It's that simplistic. And it's just as well, because nothing is said that's worth hearing. Camera shots, facial expressions and body-language takes are so stereotypic and juvenile. Subtlety has no place in modern media. Every 'adult' has to behave like a large sexually-aware child. In fact this point is taken to such extreme that there simply are no old or even middle-aged people in Smallville. Everyone above the age of 30 has been deleted! Nor are there any children. Didin't anyone have parents or younger siblings? Doesn't anyone keep pets? Because I've yet to see a cat or a dog. Perhaps the makers spent too much time watching 'Logan's Run'. And of course; every female has a pert and well figured body, whilst every man has exemplary pects and a six-pack. So it would appear that along with ageing; obesity and unhealthy lifestyles have also been ironed-out in this idealised vision of absurdity. This is 'Scooby Doo' but without Scooby Doo and with real actors playing cartoon stereotypes.Strictly for backward children.""
Smallville didn't create anything when it was on air. When Arrow came to the scene all the other shows followed because of its success.Smallville was a good show nevertheless. Its a superman show. We've seen it all already.The acting is alright and the story is what we've seen many times. I have nothing bad or great to say about it. It had a great run tho.Verdict: Watch and enjoy.
""I enjoy this show. It's pretty great. My favorite seasons are the earlier ones. Season 1 - 4 all tie as my favorite. Then with each season, I like it less and less. Don't get me wrong, the other six seasons are all still good. The story lines are good and the cast are very talented.This show is about the evolution of Clark Kent, the man we know as Superman. We see him discovering himself as a teenager, and what he must go through to become the legend we all have heard of. Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.""
One would have been sufficient ... a world class piece of crap ... the male star looks like a crack addict and his smarts are answering jeopardy questions which most morons and imbeciles can do with ease ... a phd in economics makes him mr wizard for 2 minutes ... i'm saying not to waste time watching buncko
""Do we need another spionage series? If it's well done why not. I just finished the first season and it was entertaining, with a good story and some suspense. It's not at the same level as Homeland or The Americans, which are both top shows about spionage, but it's good enough to have a nice evening, or in my case a couple of binge watching evenings. To me the minor point is John Krasinski playing Jack Ryan. I can't help it but I just can't see him as a CIA agent. He should stick with his funny romantical characters. But besides that it's a good series, and I can see it making several seasons without being boring.""
""Firstly the people giving a positive rating to Season Two positively are single use accounts, using a lot of similar phrasing. IE marketing people, not actual audience.Lets get this straight: Tom Clancy was not Proust, he wrote reasonably well written, highly studied on the facts, but not great novels. But his work is NOT marvel comics and this series has become a comic book nonsense. Thirdly, Clancy did sometimes do the geopolitics in broad strokes, but he never ever would have made the basic error of portraying a socialist dictator as a right wing dictator. Where were the fact checkers for this series when some idiot inverted a basic geopolitical fact (Venezuela's left wing dictatorship into right wing) ???Krasinki walks through this second season as if he didn't care. Maybe it is his over-rated acting skills or maybe he knew the script was so bad that he didn't care, but he is almost sneering at the audience with his portrayal.Really everything about season two is cringe-worthy.""

""'This is a show I love to hate and hate to love. It took awhile to get going. Although this show is about as unrealistic as it gets, you have to keep in mind it is tv..and not intended on being REAL. The characters have almost all been with each other romantically, sort of like Melrose place. Some of the storylines were not that great or interesting but at the end of the episode, I still found myself anxiously awaiting the next. I never watched the show when it aired. Just recently watched on Netflix. I watched all episodes over about a week\'s time. My least fave character was JENNY. There was something about her that I couldn\'t stand. The The character Chuck Bass had facial expressions and a voice that was exaggeratedly done and sort of annoying but I still liked him. I don\'t think there was one single episode that didn\'t include the line I am chuck Bass in it. I give the show a 7 because the storylines could have been better, but it was still entertaining enough to watch. I was bummed out that I ran out of episodes to watch. The ending was not what I hoped for but it is what it is.'""
'This TV Show THE BEST for escaping the world for a little bit. Such an intriguing plot and so much romance! I love it!'
""It is entertaining, if you like the genre. I would be cutting my wrists if my son and daughters had that style of life and I wouldn't want them to see it, because of the bad examples. For mature people, it is fun, love the fashion styles and the characters are likable enough to make one want to check in for the next episode""
'I like the bit where he dropped a chainsaw down the stairs on the woman'
The show was a copy of TVD which means it had strong performances great action-thriller scenes and constant suspense plus we did not got bored with that VD Helena love triangle but the show suffered from the same supernatural problems the vampire diaries suffered too.At some point they have to understand that killing someone for good and then to bring him back to life whenever they want in his body or in another body it doesn't make sense and kills the suspense of killing someone.I Mean....what's the point that almost all of our heroes were once dead but then somehow they were resurrected again ?so....Klaus father was dead but claus mother brings him back to life only for claus to kill him again.......OK so what the heck ? if they want they will bring him back. that is the major flaw for both shows.when someone is dead....................is dead don't bring him back. it ruins everything if u want to have a realistic show.apart from that if u are a fan of TVD u will love that show too even more better but at some point u will be tired of the same formula.I now reached season 3 of this show and season 6 of TVD and I only watch it now to see how the stories will end as I know that death really not matters anymore in those series.
""The Originals is much more than some teen supernatural drama. The storyline is extremely compelling and explores an old topic in a new and fresh way. There are no victims in this show, everyone has their own strengths and it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.I also find the cast really likable and even when they return to their old evil ways you can still see the humanity in the characters. I can't help but want to like them as they've been through so much pain in the past.Now I must confess that yes I love all things supernatural including Twilight...but the difference is I am well aware that the Twilight movie is absolutely terrible, and in-spite of that I love it but The Originals is actually good.There's action, romance and great special effects. All round an entertaining show.""

One of the best things in shows in my opinion is loyalty, and this show has no shortage of that. Klaus really stepped up and showed what his family meant to him in here, and had a BIG development as the show went on.eventually you are introduced to what i would say is truly my favorite character(outside of the original family) which is davina. she is bad ass when it came to standing up to klaus.as the show goes on you are also introduced to the long lost sister freya, and at first her intentions are questionable(at least to me), but as the show went on she became my favorite character!.Although sad I was satisfied with the ending.'""
""'Desperate Housewives is a comedy/drama that leans more to the comedy side of things and is decidedly aimed at (drum roll please) housewives! Sure, it\'s a show most adults, male or female can enjoy, but the writers are hellbent into making it a woman\'s show.\nIf I\'m correct, only one lady out of the four leads is actually married, the others being divorced, widowed or simply on the prawl for a new male partner.\nThese are women in their mid 30s to late 40s and I find it rather odd to see a show making fun out of pretty serious stuff: divorce, cheating, promiscuity, etc. Maybe I\'m taking this stuff too serious but I simply don\'t find this show as compelling as say, Friends.\nI don\'t mean to sound mysoginous but Desperate Housewives is, to me, a show exclusively for those wives bored and annoyed with their marriages.\nIf they feel that way, maybe they should end their relationships and do whatever they please, just like the desperate wives they idolize on this TV show.'""
""'Certainly the idea of an appearance of normalcy with all the treachery that goes on beneath is a theme that\'s been done many times. Nothing new there. But I enjoy this show for several reasons. It has some actresses I really like in it, i.e., Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Nicolette Sheridan. It\'s great to see all of them working and in a hit. Since I\'m not a fan of the reality show trend, I also like the idea that this is not one - nor, of course, do I find it very realistic. (I did, however, catch a woman on Oprah who swears she is a clone of the Marcia Cross character so maybe it\'s not so out there after all.) I like the fact that it\'s a combo of Letter to Three Wives and Twin Peaks. There\'s a mystery - we don\'t know why the narrator killed herself, and we don\'t know what certain people are doing in the neighborhood or what they\'re investigating/covering up. That darkish aspect is what makes it interesting.'""

A rollercoaster of pleasure, bliss, sadness and thrill throughout.It has quality written all over it. It has one the best script, story, cast and acting in the whole TV industry.\nBrenda Strong's voice and narrative alone are enough to make you shiver, have goosebumps and dream. She was extraordinary and breathtaking.I loved Marcia Cross. She was my favourite, ever since I got to know her from Melrose Place.\nShe is one of the most beautiful, talented and wonderful actresses out there. She just shines. She has depth and class painted all over her. Would like to see more of her in series. Marcia please!7 years have passed since I finished the show, but I still feel it like it was the first day.

""An intriguing mystery, a stonking cast and a poignant performance by Reese Witherspoon look like making Big Little Lies appointment viewing for the next couple of months.With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard on board, the series isn't short of star wattage, but it's Witherspoon's performance as Madeline Mackenzie, a wife and mother who feels cruelly superfluous in her own home, that reels the viewer in in this first episode.The drama takes place in Monterey, California, where Silicon Valley's nouveau riche rub shoulders with the working class as parents of pupils at a particularly desirable public school.

""'I must warn you a bit about Big Little Lies. This HBO series is very violent, with vivid depictions of domestic violence. It also has a lot of nudity. In addition, the show is one that EASILY could overwhelm viewers...especially those who have been through domestic violence and rape. A tough show....but an amazing one. So, if you\'re inviting over Father O\'Malley or your mother, you might just want to think twice about seeing this one with them.The series is about three women in Monterey, California....a very expensive and swank town to live in, though not quite as swank as nearby Carmel. Regardless, the story centers on these women as well as the men and children in their lives...as well as their \'friends\' who are mostly social climbing back-biters and jerks. I could say so much more about the plot....suffice to say it\'s exquisitely written and has some of the best acting you could ever hope to see. Considering there are tons of reviews about the series already, I\'ll just end it here with an admonition to watch the show...it\'s sensational.By the way, as a trained therapist and ex-social worker, I really appreciated the writing of this show. Their portrayal of domestic violence as well as how a therapist works were both spot on and I appreciate this.'""
""'A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.'""
""'The main thing that I took from Big Little Lies is that we lead screwed-up existences. The protagonists have what look like the ideal lives, but it becomes clear that something is amiss. Whether it\'s a lack of fulfillment or something worse, all three are living a lie. The story gets told as a series of interviews to let the viewer know that the action is building up to something big.I wouldn\'t call this the best miniseries that HBO has made (remember, this is the channel that gave us The Sopranos and Game of Thrones), but serves as a good look at the problems that arise when we try to ignore the simmering tensions amid a supposedly perfect world. The morally complex characters make this a series for the ages. Not to mention that it\'s a treat to see Reese Witherspoon play a role markedly different from the ones with which she\'s usually associated. And as someone who went to grad school in Monterey, it was neat to see some of my old haunts.I recommend it, and I hope to read the book, and that Jean-Marc VallÃÂ©e (of Dallas Buyers Club and Wild) keeps turning out work like this.'""

I like how it develops the characters\' personal lives as the show progresses and avoids stereotyped characters. Indeed, I expected Kurt\'s father to be a hard-ass but he accepts his son\'s homosexuality. Even the malevolent Sue Sylvester has her own story.So far I like this show.

There are so many things wrong here, so many caricatures and clichÃÂ©s, so many plot holes and stupid behaviour on the part of the good guys. Do Americans really like this?

For example, there is a repeition of criminal betrays FBI Agent\'s trust, and then wins back that trust -- again and again and again. When watching the show periodically you don\'t think about it so much, but when watching seasons 1-6 in one month, you can\'t stop wondering, How many times would I forgive someone?'""

After Caleb's death she ended up dating Dr. Neil Roberts, Summer (Rachel Bilson) - Seth's crush-then-girlfriend-then-not-then-gf-again -'s father.In the meanwhile everybody has his or her sentimental - and psychological - trouble...Going into Season 3, the show seems to have regained some of the moment lost in the abysmal Season 2, with dry wit, drama and comedy mixed together, like old times.But now that the main female of the teens is dead, most probably the show will have to change tones.Is it going to be good? Or Not? We'll just have to wait November and see...The OC: 7/10.""

""'its secret of success is the art to transform insignificant, small every day details in the perfect show. because each of us is a member of the Bundy family or his neighbors. the frustrations, the fears, the embarrassing facts and the stereotypes are present in this amazing show about values and not charming sides of it. and this is all. and it is enough for see yourself from different angle, fore recognize common sins and for discover the old fashion comedy in new package but with the old ingredients . the life of an ordinary family across changes, challenges and sins. right answer to the pink worlds proposed by entertainment industry. and this does it special. so, Married with Children. and the voice of Frank Sinatra as introduction.'""
""A dysfunctional family headed by a loud mouth idiot is nothing new. In fact, it's a dime a dozen nowadays. But for its times, it pushed all the envelopes.Ed O'Neill delivers a big time performance as the loser husband shoe salesman. Katey Sagal creates a chocolate bonbon filled wife. Christina Applegate is the dim-witted blonde daughter. David Faustino is the creepy little brother.The writing is rock-solid. The show kept pushing the censors. The fact that many people opposed it just made it so much better. But it's the actors who created such outlandish characters that deserves the most praise. It lasted a shocking 11 years. The last few were of lower quality stuff, but it still deserves all the love.""
'Except maybe Ari and Lloyd NONE of the boys who make up the little movie star entourage of buddies can act in this show. Vincent\'s actor has struggled after this show to find work in particular because he\'s such a boring actor you can\'t believe any of this good fortune is happening to. However the actor who played Vince\'s older brother Johnny ever found work in Hollywood is beyond me why anyone thought he would be a good idea in it. Except maybe one season everything good happens to them one episode after another like God needs Vince\'s permission for it to rain and ooh look another washed up celebrity cameo! Wow. This show has one of the worst opening songs ever and I like a lot of 90s rock. I used to watch this when I had nothing else to watch waiting for a new season of this or that show. At least it wasn\'t as bad as the movie. The movie was not needed at all. The only thing saving this from a 1 star is I did enjoy it somewhat and the series ended really well. However the movie was absolute garbage. Excuse me while I watch Eminem\'s cameo in season 8 on loop.'
""A show, true-to-life, about a bunch of tag alongs, who rather make money off of their friend, instead of getting a real job. I knew plenty of people like that, who had nothing going on with their lives and wanted to ride off of the coattails of others. That's all this show is about.""
""Based loosely on Mark Wahlberg and his friends arriving in L.A. early in his career. This real life inspiration gives it good originality and a fresh take. Kevin Connolly is the cool headed best friend. Adrian Grenier is the hot sexy new star. Kevin Dillon is the older brother who has had limited success. Jerry Ferrara is the punchline to many of the group's jokes. And Jeremy Piven is the memorable scheming talent agent Ari.Girls, excess and the L.A. party scene draw us in but it's the group's friendship that keeps us watching. No matter what the obstacle, the group eventually pulls together but maybe after some hilarious ribbing. The last few season do feel a little stretched out. Ninety six hour-long episodes are a lot for any non-procedural serial.""
""'Bringing Sherlock Holmes into the twentieth century, that concept has been tried before so I cannot say that this new show is original but Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu bring interesting interpretations to the roles of Holmes and Watson. Actually, Liu was the reason that I tuned in to watch the premiere. I have been a fan of hers ever since I saw the Charlie\'s Angels movies and I thought if anyone can play a tough heroine who can hold her own against any man it\'s her. She does precisely that in the premiere that I saw. This series looks like its going to be very dark and its characters haunted and tormented. Holmes by his addiction and Watson over the guilt she feels about a patient\'s death. There was one scene where Holmes coldly deduces that is what her problem is. I wanted Watson to punch him out right there! Holmes has never been played as more of an arrogant self righteous ass then he is in this show. I predict that this show isn\'t going to last very long. Oh well, maybe Lucy can make Charlie\'s Angels 3.'""
""Elementary sells itself fairly well, but it's almost a direct copy of House but for policework - the cases are convoluted, but unlike the medical seem to rely on a deus ex machina even more than House. Thus the Monk connection. The characters of Holmes and Watson are OK, but I just can't connect with them enough to make this primetime viewing of choice.All in all, this is adequate rather than great TV, the writer (who is also executive producer) seems to work out strange cases and expect us to fit our credulity to it - it would be better with a little bit more research and footwork and little less random associations.The show will do well, but I for one cannot rave about it.""
""'all seems great. the idea, the script, the acting, the details who define each period. and the flavor of 50\'s in the most realistic manner to define it. sure, it is the result of a happy meeting between a courageous and real great director and the best actors for its project around a dream who is preserved by the imagination of each from us. but not the idea is the most important thing. the mixture of humor, tension, cultural references, the chemistry - yes, the word sounds strange but in this case is the best - between Christopher Lloyd and Michael Fox , the wise use of clichÃÂ©s about teenagers and family, the ignored guy who becomes hero, all make the story to roll in amazing manner. so, a sort of masterpiece. and one of the most adorable meet with a film. off course, a legendary one.'""
""Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex- surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu). Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his 'guardian'. The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde'. Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp""
""Not interested at all in this series because the summary didn't fulfill what i do like in a series I never picked it up until a friend told me to do so because it's rather not that bad at all. Have seen the two seasons at this writing I must say that it is one of the best series I have seen so far.People of True Blood being involved it shows again. You have different 'people' in it like the white people, the Amish and the Indians and the androgen that does give Banshee a special touch. But not only that, the characters are very strong and the way it was shot is excellent with a lot of arty-shots. To give it an extra touch the score used is special too. I wont go into the story itself because it do evolve every time and some things you just don't see coming. It never has a boring moment, every episode delivers excellent suspense full of action (some rather gory), fight scene's that are brutal, a lot of nudity even full frontal and extreme people. After Spartacus and The Walking Dead series this surely follows in my personal top 5. A must see.Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 2,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5""
""A mysterious ex-convict leaves prison and arrives in Banshee, Pennsylvania tracking his love Anastasia Rabitov. He is at Sugar Bates' bar when a fight breaks out. One of the dead is the newly arrived Lucas Hood who is set to take over as sheriff. With the help of computer hacker Job, he takes on the identity of Lucas Hood and becomes the new sheriff in town. Ana has lived a life of suburban mom Carrie Hopewell married to DA Gordon Hopewell. Her oldest daughter Deva is actually the daughter of the mystery man. Rebecca Bowman rebels against her Amish upbringing to join her criminal uncle Kai Proctor. There are other criminal power bases in the native community and the neo-Nazis.This is unabashed pulpy goodness. There is sex, brutal violence, over-the-top action, and hard characters. The most unusual aspect is the brutal violence against women and by women. The show doesn't hold back with the blood splatter and the kinetic action. The characters are well-drawn and memorable. This is one show that knows what it is and how to do it.""
""'I loved this show as the acting was hardcore, the violence was hardcore and the women were hardcore. It was a great show the likes which we might never see again.'""
""That's probably not my last comment about this tremendous TV show which reminds me ROAD HOUSE, WALKING TALL and some other stuff on this basic scheme: country side action and crime story. But that's all. For the rest, that's a typical new series where you will find nothing you may purchase in big screen pictures, about characters development - of course, you have more space and time to do it - and daring screenplay schemes, violence at a rate that, in for most cinema made films, it would be Parents Guidance rated. And that would not enhance the box office performance. But for home audiences, who cares if you have tons of brutality, that, on the contrary, enlarge, increase, the audiences and assure the show to continue beyond the first season? Take for instance a family father who wants to go and wee a brutal film in a theatre with his children; he can't, because the PG rating. But if he is at home, he puts the kids in the bedroom with a computer and he is quiet and comfortable to watch the film in the living room....It is important to understand the differences between big screen movies and TV series.""
'Season 1: 6/10\nvery well made. tom hardy is a beast. not the most exciting show and a little weird at times but an enjoyable experience (1 viewing)'
""This is highly competent television, as competent as Vikings or Boardwalk Empire. Oddly I'd be more inclined to compare it to Vikings than to say, Penny Dreadful or The Frankenstein Chronicles, despite a difference in periods. Tom Hardy is perfect and highly charismatic. This is probably his best role since Peaky Blinders. His character corkscrews around in outrageous self-assurance whilst the plot delivers surprise after surprise. The sets are as authentic as The Frankenstein Chronicles or Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. The characters are Dickensian, but all seem to have a dose of Viking in them. The villains are very human by comparison, but have a whole lot more power and resources. This is a wonderful against-the-odds story. It's wonderful when a period piece such as this transports the viewer into a world that despite its age, appears new, fresh, even young.Importantly for a possibly seminal work, this series won't leave anyone hanging with a rotten cliffhanger at the end. All the same, if there is a sequel I won't be lax in jumping to see it.""
""Firstly, Thank you BBC for putting a drama on for a Saturday Night, how many years has it been? Secondly thanks for making it something as special as Taboo. A few episodes in and I am utterly hooked, it is gripping, beautifully made, somehow cinematic, boasting wonderful music, glorious settings, and acting that is beyond impressive. Tom Hardy will always attract fans in their millions, his looks and talent make him a massive hit, I have a feeling we'll be seeing James Delaney for many years to come. David Hayman and Jonathan Pryce are both superb in their own rights. The trailers made this show look good, but in reality it is quite special, a period drama that is dark, gritty and wonderfully Gothic. I like that there is an air of mystery surrounding it too, can't wait to see how this unfolds. Do not miss this, you'll love it.""
""So, what we have here is a game of blame. A blame game that pushes the responsibility for a suicide from the individual to everyone else, almost saying that the decision to off oneself is made by others.And then, as if to draw the biggest difference between Millennials and everyone else, it almost goes out of its way to say that people don't base their views on what everyone else thinks are wrong for being independently minded.The message is clear, let others think for you unto your death.""
This is one of the best series i have ever seen. 13 reasons why is so heart touching and makes us thrilled in every single episode. Katherine as Hannah and Dylan as Clay had a very good chemistry and both of them did a decent job. Another best part of the series is the soundtrack. The background musics and the songs were just perfect for the mood of the series. All the leading cast did great with their roles. The cinematography is so good as every frame feel like we are in it. All 13 episodes are thrilling and at at the same entertaining. 13 Reasons Why is a must watch. Don't miss this series.
""If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!""

Mentioned above the overacting & over-characterization for dramatic effect (made for TV so what to expect?) gives a misleading portrait of your typical high school behavior.\nMost importantly was the inaccurate portrayal of the counselor (and other school administrators, and teachers). Counselors & teachers have many legal impediments in terms of pursuing topics of a personal nature to students. They also are heavily restrained from physically touching the acting-out student even when said student is very disruptive or just a little harmful.\n3. Contrary to the movie's characterization most students are actually boringly good conscientious students. Although many know how far they can go to take up class time with talk & swagger.\n4. Next season they could go the gun angle since they showed a student w/a weapon; an unfortunate obvious topic. Or it may be too sensitive a topic.""

""The first series of Waller-Bridge's Fleabag was a legitimate comedy phenomenon - propelling her to international stardom, resuscitating the ailing BBC Three and breathing sharp life and fresh wit back into British comedy. Adapted from a one-woman Edinburgh play - Fleabag's fourth-wall breaking blend of filthy razor-sharp observational comedy and brittle humanity - centered around Waller-Bridge's vastly magnetic screen presence and what can only be described as the most shrewdly melded mix of editing, performance and writing ever attempted. I love it utterly and no praise is enough for what it does and what it is.Then, out of nowhere it got a second series and remarkably they manage to not only keep the tone going but actually build on it to reach one of the most bruised and cathartic finales in TV history. It's a gorgeous piece of work - all hands are magnificently cast (particularly the vastly underrated Bill Paterson who I've loved for years), it's a kaleidoscope of joy and pain. Do watch it.""
""I'm still so annoyed with BBC3 for switching to online only, I still enjoy watching the show on my lunch break at work, but it doesn't beat watching it on the box.Fleabag is one of the best shows to come from BBC3 since the likes of Gary Tank Commander and Cuckoo. I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved. Olivia Colman can do no wrong, but it's nice to see her cast in a very different role, so often playing a 'sweet' character, she shows her versatility. Bill Patterson great also,""
""When I watched the first episode of Fleabag, I thought it was very funny but at the same time thought the main character was a bit off putting. But don't worry, her awfulness is mainly show.When I got around to watching the second episode, which was even funnier, I was hooked, and binge-watched the rest.Phoebe Waller-Bridge gives an amazing performance. She has a wonderfully expressive face which she uses to communicate with the audience, who she treats as a friend she's sharing secrets with. She can say everything with just a wry look or a moment of surprise.While Fleabag can seem like a sex-obsessed sitcom, the series insistently adds complexity to its characters. The main character is funny and bawdy, but also haunted by the death of a friend and traumatized by her upbringing. Her sister at first seems like a stock antagonist, but their relationship turns out to be far more nuanced, and the actresses' chemistry is remarkable. Even a bit part early on is given a chance at redemption.This is the first I've heard of Waller-Bridge, but she is an incredible talent. I just learned she made another series this year called Crashing, so I know what I'm watching next! (Update: I watched it, it was great)""
""Lacked subtitles for the elderly, disabled, hearing impaired, and ESL viewers. Disrespectful & cheap on the part of the producers especially when audio & enunciation is poor, and the varying British dialects. Dialogue is important!Main weaknesses: Trying to be cutesy clever by having actors talk directly to the camera. Second, usual hooks of alcohol & smoking to seem like just regular folk. Very pretentious dialogue. First episode was completely people just sitting around a table drinking & arguing. Usual social corporate gathering party including garden party scenes (both with food & drinks as the main props, of course). Usual search for romance. That's it.""
""'If this review was just for the first season, the rating would have been four out of ten. However, second season was much much better. They lessen the unnecessary profanity and they kept it more real, about a problematic character in a messy family. The comedy was so so but the performances were really good. So, seven out of ten.'""
""'The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn\'t necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn\'t easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes. For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.Now I see there is a an untitled Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.'""

""'Sigh.

It\'s probably the best SF TV-show there ever was. Filled with strong characters, strong actors, strong writing and brilliant storytelling structure.Gaius Baltar is the greatest crazy scientist this side of Dr. Frankenstein; his increasingly schizoid personality is superbly rendered.There are only two things wrong with this show: One, we don\'t see nearly enough of Starbuck. Two, there is apparently no budget for the astronomical side of things - when they get water from an ice moon, we see nothing of it. We\'re just told that it happened. I wanna see some planets and alien environments! Come on, it can\'t be that expensive!But overall, an unspeakably great show with lots of story of a quality that doesn\'t insult your intelligence. This is fantastic space opera! History will be the judge, and this show will be utterly classic.My rating: 8 out of 10 - it was 9 in the first season, but I think the quality has trailed off.'""
""The mystery behind this show was very well thought out. During the entire series your trying to figure out who A is. That might sound like a boring concept, but as you follow the lives of the main cast; its extremely interesting. Unlike a normal high school drama, I find the series has more of an adult feel to it. The smaller stories within the big are extremely interesting that it keeps you wanting to watch more. The cast chosen for the show are very talented actresses/actors; they all play extremely well off of each other and do such an amazing job with their parts. The only reason I don't give this one a 10, is that the last season doesn't do the show justice.""
""I remember watching this show in high school it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time trying to figure out who A was. It was so many loops the Liars had to go through before the finale showdown, I'm just glad I know who A is now.""
'A fun if imperfect show. One of its MAJOR flaws is that it was driven a little too much by its fandoms. One of its bravest story lines at one point had former teacher Ezra Fitz as a possible A but due to the backlash it was quickly and quite badly backtracked. The same with Ali. Bad Girl Ali was one of the most interesting and entertaining characters on the show but by the end the need to pair her with good girl Emily had the show paint her as redeemed to the point of her being almost boring. That is and will always be the main drawback of the show. Forget the implausibility of many/most of the story lines. This was never billed as a very plausible show. It was a fun entertaining psychological thriller and stayed that way throughout. It was just that there were certain pairings that a large number of the fandom wanted as endgame most notably Ezra/Aria and Ali/Emily and writing into that made for some of the worst late series story lines. Still I would recommend the show to anyone who liked a good psychological thriller.'

Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable.

It went out in a quiet frenzy with our two main characters making an edgy yet unremarkable escape. Maybe I'm being too picky because I did not expect this to happen. Whatever, I did enjoy this show start to stop.Bravo!""
""'But this season truly was outstanding. It\'s been such an amazing year for TV, and I think this, Mad Men, Fargo, and Hannibal all stand on top of the drama pack in terms of their last seasons. I get why Hannibal won\'t make a splash with the Emmys, but how didn\'t Season 1 of this and how will it not again? Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are giving some of the finest TV acting, especially Russell. The characterization and plotting of this season is pretty impressive. Season 1\'s emotional core was the Jennings\' marriage, and this season was their relationship with their children, more specifically Paige. Seeing the new doors that the finale opened up, I can\'t wait for the next season. The show\'s truly found a perfect balance between all of the thrilling stuff and everything else around it, it never feels bogged down and it always gives enough emphasis to the characterization, in a way that could really test people\'s patience. Also, no other current show does musical montages like this one. Season Grade- AAlso, the ratings for this seem to be pretty awful, how the hell did it get renewed for another season? Regardless, I\'ll take it!'""
""Love, Death & Robots was originally going to be a feature length reboot of Heavy Metal; it's pretty damn stupefying knowing the path they ultimately decided to go with: an animated series of self-contained stories on Netflix where there are no true restraints on the contents of the stories or visuals. These stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.Netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'Stranger Things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. Love, Death & Robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. I'd say that my favorites would have to be 'Alternate Histories', 'Good Hunting', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'The Witness'. To be fair though, ALL the episodes are pretty good. They each cover their own respective genres just nicely.If you want to check out Love, Death & Robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto. It's a Netflix-Must!This Netflix-Must gets 4.5/5 stars.""
""As i went through each episode i couldn't help but start predicting the scenes. The scenes werent only predictable they were illogical. Take for example Three Robots which had three robots on vacation traveling around taking vacations to see post apocalyptic civilizations.Two of the robots had mouths, one digital, one mechanical, both used for talking, but when they looked at human food they... nevermind. It isn't logical and it is a lack of attention to detail.Every episode had these logical errors which dragged down the story. So overall while the idea, the art, the motivation were interesting, the series of short movies failed to keep me entertained.""
""SHEESH these robots are crazy.The fun anthology series returned with a second season. Similar to the first season, each episode has different animation, for the most part, and only one episode wasn't animated. Even though it's not thought-provoking and rich in themes like Black Mirror, I still love this series for its entertainment.And this second season wasn't different, as I enjoyed most of the episodes. The best episodes were the ones that had horror elements. They were adrenaline-inducing and intense in such a short amount of time. There was one episode that wasn't intense at all, and was more nonchalant and philosophical than the rest. This was my least favorite episode, as I found it weird and boring.Overall, the second season mostly gave me what I loved about the first season. Very entertaining. 8.5/10.""
""So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!""
""Yep. Sometimes I have to log in, come here to the comments, and put in my two bits JUST because... a show or movie made me cry. This is one of those times.And even when a particular episode doesn't tug at those particular heartstrings, it winds up tugging at some others. And there's just not enough of that in popular media products, these days.Netflix is picking up the old narrative gantlets that traditional media money is now leaving to (otherwise) shrivel up and die on the ground. Good on 'em.""

""'When asked the question; what is the best anime, Death Note should be in the conversation. This show is GRIPPING. The viewer is almost always on the edge of their seat. The characters are very, very intelligent and capable in their roles.It\'s an awesome show.'""
""On the first 10 episodes, I thought Death Note was rather interesting and different. I have heard of it before until 6 years later, I went onto YouTube and finally got around watching it. Although as I watched the 10 episodes and the second Kira Misa appeared, I just lost interest. I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away. I know he's meant to be scary but for god sakes, he doesn't blink or show any emotions, it gives me bloody chills when a cartoon character looks like that haha! I wouldn't call this my favorite anime but I would call it an anime to remember!""
""Well, at least almost nothing. 20+ episodes is just way too much of pointless conversations in combination with more or less interesting twists. If it would have been condensed into half it could have been a good show. There is suspense, thrill, depth, intelligence and moral but also randomness, repetition, cliche and shallowness. Maybe I miss the point of my 1st anime series but from a pure entertainment side it's in my POV average at best.""
""I watched first 6 (out of 37) episodes and I'm hooked. Although this type of animation goes on my nerves, it's not as bad as in other anime I encountered so far, and the story is so good that I have to see it through, no matter retarded looks of Shinigami and all the other flaws of the genre. This would be excellent feature thriller, either movie or series. If possible, in Japanese or European production, although I doubt even Hollywood could screw it too much. But, speculation on the side, in this form, I rate it8/10As the series progressed, I was more and more tempted to give it a 9, or even 10, but the last episode was a real disappointment. Someone who has been living a triple life for six years and playing the game at such a high level would not make such an amateur mistake. I knew they will get him eventually, but I was expecting some highly intelligent mindfak, not the outworn cliche of a villain exulting in the face of the enemy before his plan succeeded. Final rating8,5/10""
'This show has a long of Kid Friendly stuff and some Suggestive content'
This show is really awesome to be honest I grow with the anime as I'm encounter it as some distraction like every single episode of this anime have 5 to 10 minutes of flashback actually the flashback is not necessary to build the storyline it's actually distracted from the plot.

Among the Marvel films made so far, it is probably slightly better than average.

""Season 1: 3\nWhat i liked: the show is visually stunning. and the sci-fi concepts are beastly. what i disliked: basically everything else. it's a low quality show disguised as a high quality show because of how nice it looks. the acting is mediocre with some being really bad (like ortega). the dialogue is childish at points, and for some reason they switch between various languages without warning so you have to start reading subs at a moment's notice and i had to go back a bunch of times. and there are so many typical parts, cliches, and really dumb moments. i laughed a lot in this, all at unintended humor. the intended humor was terrible. but worst of all, the fight scenes were absolute garbage. except for one scene which was pretty good, the rest were abysmal. i'm talking 0 star fight scenes. you couldn't see what was happening at all. so many quick cuts and shaky cam. just absolutely awful. you know it's bad when i want to move past the action scenes to get to the boring stuff. speaking of boring stuff, so many parts i just wanted them to move past, like the emotional stuff between elliot and ava. and the story was ridiculously convoluted while at the same time being generally uninteresting. bad combination. yet another garbo showing from netflix (1 viewing)""
""A TV critic I respect recommended this. I haven't read the book it is based on.The CGI is terrific, the concept I am enjoying.Joel Kinnaman mumbles so I had to throw on the CC.First observation is that there are so many fight scenes which means massive grunting and no dialogue. That always disengages me from the characters and leaves me thinking: too many big words, let's throw in red lasers and masks and big huge fights. Interesting that 250 years from now the hero can't be pulverized into dust in a nano-second and that what looks like duct tape is still used to bind another character to a chair.I'm hoping it will improve and engage the intelligence a little more. I'm picking up on allusions to religions that don't allow sleeving which bothers me.""
""DEADWOOD became quite overlooked at both the Emmy and Golden Globe awards, though it saw Ian McShanan anchoring his Al Swearengen an Golden Globe statue this series should proudly have strutted more awards after its three years run. You won't find a better TV-drama than this, surely we've seen Sopranos-commercial success and Six Feet Under's bizarre and highly original pull-offs, but Deadwood has an edge and guts that's truly, truly remarkable - the character performances for one thing is gold, Swearengen (the leading gusto) is nothing but stunning, his barbarous methods may be devil-sent, but his vision is even stronger as he staves off chaos controlling Deadwood. And although like other HBO-series say Sopranos or even more promptly, the Wire, the show is a slow-burning affair, the episodes are languorosly as they talk and talk, discuss, push & pull - but the narrative moves are so perfectly placed that it doesn't get boring for a single second. All of the Deadwood-citizens are making way for politics, education and culture, law & order doesn't steer Deadwood with its firm hand - Deadwood itself does, anarchy in a western-civilization in which everyone avoids chaos, but chaos is inevitable. Throughout its three seasons we see the Gold Rush Dakota-setting going from its giddy to its change of time, the Great West changing course. You faint of heart, cover your ears and shut your eyes - live fast, die young - Deadwood's in town.""
""'/refers to Seasons 1 & 2/Together with Scandinavian (particularly Danish and Swedish) crime series, British ones are a sign of quality as well, I have not come across with any that is really annoying. True, their pace is slower and they can well do without constant shootings and chases, so there is a lot of focus on human psychology-relations-background.Still, it is always good when there is a novel depiction mode or interesting intertwining - as we can see in Broadchurch, where it seemed after Season 1 that Season 2 should be based on a) totally new case b) events followed by an escape of the suspect. But the witty combination of and references to an unsolved earlier case make Season 2 even more gripping and versatile. Apart from skillful direction and camera-work, there are also very good and realistic performances (no one chosen by just a cute looks and no one sticking unnecessarily out due to his/her fame), and wonderful beach and sea views forming a complex entirety and creating an atmosphere so becoming for such a series. Thus, another good viewer experience, recommended to all those not regarding human and family matters as spoilers on the way of thrill. But one should watch all episodes in succession and definitely begin with Season 1.PS Season 3 is another thrilling creation, with versatile references to Season 2 and distinct solution of the crime.'""
""This is one of the most incredible television shows I've ever seen. At the beginning the story comes into focus very quickly and the rest of the multi-episode show takes the viewer on a long roller coaster ride where we meet a cast of characters in a town like many others, with varying degrees of virtue and vice, covering a wide spectrum of British society. In truth, it could be anywhere. The mood is dark and psychological forces are at war. The town where this movie takes place could be anywhere and yet it seems like a place we all know because it exposes the secrets, the paranoia, the fears of being caught amid the casual friendships and veneer that we call everyday life. Dark music accompanies the progress of the show as we see one person after another cringe with fear as to where the next blow will land. Yet, we also see how human nature can rebound and lost souls can rally together and forge unity when crime pulls people apart. David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker, and Andrew Buchan are outstanding in this series. There are no heroes, only victims. If you want escapist entertainment, don't watch this. However, if you want to find out how we react when the social order seems to become unhinged as the result of a single crime, this show will deliver superbly.""

""'I won\'t spend any time here discussing the horrible way this show was marketed and broadcast--resulting in an early cancellation--except to say that I was one of the original viewers and I felt betrayed.Firefly is my favorite television show of all time.The basic premise bears some resemblance to Star Wars, but FF does it better. The music is great, the production values are great, the set of the ship is fantastic. The cast is terrific. But what really makes this show is the writing. The characters are truly developed and nuanced, far from one-dimensional. The plots are intriguing and different. The universe of FF expands throughout the first season.The guest stars deserve special mention. There were many portrayals worthy of Emmy nods (hello, Christina Hendricks!). Joss Whedon had created such a wonderful first season, if the show had continued, there were so many story lines to build on. I think FF would have been an Emmy factory.'""
""Firefly has a huge cult following, and I can see why. Had it been allowed to grow and develop, it could have turned into a fantastic series the way Buffy did (whih actually had a much weaker first season than this). As it is though, it's just really good, although it does hit greatness various instances. The characters are pretty fantastic and episodes in you really feel a sense of family, something Whedon has always been great at doing. It also helps that the cast is up to par, there's no weak link to be found and makes ranking them that much harder. I still have yet to see the film but I hope it doesn't disappoint, and I hope Netflix does something to bring this back.""
""Nathan Fillion as Capt. Reynolds is probably one of the coolest characters to grace your TV screen ... although he wasn't there long enough for you to enjoy him. And it's a shame that the show got axed so early.The problem the executives might have had with this TV show, is that they couldn't market it. They didn't know how to advertise the series, so it got under the radar. Not completely, because still fans watched it, but the decision not to air the pilot first was a fatal one. Even if the first episode (after the pilot movie) was a recapturing of the characters that you should've known already, it's not the same.I bought the DVD box set, because of all the buzz it was getting from the internet. The acting is great, the dialogues are a joy to listen to, the stories that are told with the character development (yes the characters do develop, even if at times only a few inches) are superb. If you like your comedy to be well written, the dialogue witty and funny and don't mind the mixture of Sci-Fi and Western, than this show is definitely something you should watch!""
""GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fun and light-hearted superhero romp from Marvel. The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first, featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical, world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects, which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt, nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine, but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun, while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing, and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable, and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later, but the camaraderie is good-natured and, more importantly, funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum, and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel.""

Whomever was writing this crap just kept spreading the story too thin. It was as if they needed to stretch stuff out because they didn't have enough content to make the episodes interesting.There are too many deus ex machina devices being used. The characters are supposed to be these amazing geniuses in the field of computers but they end up being morons. Too many episodes where they do stuff which isn't realistic or logical. Too many contrived scenes which feel like a square peg being forced in to a round hole.The predictability of the script was terrible too. I could watch the opening scene and then skip to the ending and miss nothing in the middle.I ended up stopping towards the end of the second season. I couldn't handle the predictability of the characters or the overacting, the terrible dialog or the lack of logic.

""'Years ago, I used to work for my government, and since that time I have maintained some interest in related issues, and that is why I tend to follow political series from different countries. True, I am selective in this, trying to avoid the depiction of blunt superiority and propaganda, but names like Guggenheim and Sutherland have been a sign of quality to me.Well, the US series have usually certain angles, approaches and topics not self-evident in other countries, but if you know then beforehand, you just accept them as an integral part and realise that you cannot expect the same attitudes and themes as e.g. in Borgen (Denmark). Run of events and characters in the White House seem plausible, the outcomes logical - bearing in mind the PresidentÃÂ´s forced evolution and tragic benchmark. Well, the events related to Agent Wells tend to be more action and not always compatible to what is going on arond Kirkman, but they are noo too disconcerting. Despite the Season 2 is less interesting and versatile than 1, it ends in a way that suggests the Season 3 - but not coming according to the latest information. So the all thing remains incomplete, without proper round-up.All in all, it is no House of Cards, but thanks to K. Sutherland and K. Penn, above all, it is pleasant to watch.

""'In Designated Survivor, Kiefer Sutherland plays Tom Kirkman, the Secretary of HUD who is sworn in as President when the U.S. Capitol is bombed and the leaders of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches are killed.When voters evaluate Vice Presidential candidates, they consider how they might fill the presidential role, but no one evaluates the Secretary of HUD that way. One of Kirkman\'s first tasks is to project authority and adequacy. Sutherland\'s usual whisper-talking has a gravitas that is suitable for this problem.The show deals with the problems within Kirkman\'s family, who are moved into the White House immediately. It also deals with the struggles within government as Washington tries to regain equilibrium, political and otherwise. Lastly, the bombing has spurred challenges to American authority and resolve on a global level. Can Kirkman respond to these challenges? The irony is that he may be better suited than the two major candidates now running for the Presidency in the real world.Though conflicts and crises often unite people, the situation on Designated Survivor--being focused on Washington D.C.--quickly devolves into political gamesmanship, unprincipled and illegal, though totally believable.The acting on this show is excellent. My one wish is that the show can maintain a viewpoint that is not politically biased. After three episodes, it has done a fair job of that.'""

And this Brit is also turned off by the somewhat formulaic nature of it all.This, sadly, is once again drama by numbers, the kind of thing you have seen often before and will see often again before you pop your clogs. And if it's nuance you want, subtlety, ambiguity, something pitched a little higher than just 8pm evening fodder, go to The Leftovers, Boardwalk Empire, or one of several other excellent series which have hit our screens these past few years.

Has realistic, funny, and what they would call richly-textured characters. At one point I would have put this in the 10 classic television productions of all-time, having over-dosed on the DVDs of the first season I may have mellowed a tad since then. In case you were wondering, I would include in that top 10 list (in no particular order) Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, The Avengers, The Prisoner, The Dick Van Dyke Show, M*A*S*H (early episodes only), Seinfeld, Monty Python and probably a couple of dramas I never fully appreciated. Deserves kudos for closing the TV show before completely playing itself out. 10 out of 10'""
""As a kid who grew up in the early to mid-`90s watching cartoons like Ren & Stimpy, Beavis and Butt-Head, and Rocko's Modern Life. This is a cartoon that is similar to those but not as daring. The new generation of children have a different taste from mine so the cartoons today are obviously different and I can understand that but with a cartoon like SpongeBob it is nice to see a cartoon that represents those of my generation. This is a funny cartoon and who can forget the episode where SpongeBob and Patrick were cursing. Hilarious!""
""'I grew up watching this cartoon and I have to say I enjoyed it. My favorite episode was Frankendoodle. I thought the first 3 seasons were the best. After Hillenburg left though, like many people I felt that the seasons seemed to lose their charm with each episode. They weren\'t bad but I felt like something in the humor was missing. Instead of clever puns or gags they decided to just use gross-out humor which if done right can be funny but now it\'s just overkill. Most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional now. Also Spongebob\'s more annoying due to his even more high pitched voice and antics. It\'s amazing how oblivious he is to things sometimes like a pet he brought home named Puffy Fluffy who turned out to be a monster despite Gary\'s warnings.With that being said it\'s not bad but it almost seems like a shadow of its former self. The animation\'s brighter and better but the stories seem to be hit or miss. It seems like some of them aren\'t really finished or even recycled from previous episodes. If you have little kids they\'ll enjoy it just fine. If you\'re a fan of the show still more power to you. Dive down underwater and see for yourself.'""
Sponge Bob and Square Pants i think wasn't a bad series. This all began in 1999 and now it has ended with the series in 2002. I thought this was good but i prefer all the other series such as the simpsons and the rugrats. I give this programme 7 out of 10.
""Copied the Sopranos with the nagging wife and two brats for kids that are a pain to watch every time that they are in a scene.\nRay is carrying this whole show and as soon as the story lines start to filter out into his brother's, the family and father things get unwatchable fairly fast.This show should have been cancelled after the mess of Season 5. Fans had to petition for it to continue for Sea 6 and again for Sea 7. No luck for an actual ending and Season 8 as the producers probably couldn't figure out a decent enough ending. Good thing. As bad as this was crashing I'm positive it would have ended much like the Sopranos in a restaurant, with nothing happening, and a black screen for 40 seconds.""
""'This series began with a cool premise: a Hollywood fixer who cleans up after the messes of the elite. Unfortunately, they barely touch on that and instead have made it the worst kind of soup opera imaginable. I can\'t believe people like this. Who is the target market? I cal this dwelling on family members as the Meadow Soprano Syndrome after that series went overboard on dissecting the lives of the most uninteresting people under the sun. And who the f**k cares? It\'s just an excuse not to have a plot with an actual story.Ray Donovan\'s inner circle is made up of everything from a priest-diddled brother to another punch-drunk moron of another brother, to a loud-mouth idiot of a wife with a very phony Southie accent, to a gay kid, and an adolescent daughter that should have been put to sleep instead of forcing her on viewers. Did I miss anything? That was just the first season. I stopped after that. So if you are looking for something with almost no action but heavy on really stupid family drama then this is for you.This could have been such a cool series if they had stuck with the action. I could think of ten good stories to pursue as far as his cleaning business is concerned. Instead, they went telenovela.'""
I've watched close to the entire series and even though it go's far out it's done well. The entire family becomes rounded and you end up caring for the characters. It's a very intense series and thrives in constant trauma but not like a soap opera (which I can't stand). It's not an upbeat show that's for sure but it's done so well that I stuck with it. Solid
""Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichÃÂ©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time.""
""'Ray Donovan (perhaps with not the best choice of title) is another fine example of recent trend when crime series have become more interesting and meatier than crime movies. Lots of acclaimed actors, intertwining characters and events, and twisted twists make such series interesting to follow - but, for the sake of full comprehension, you should have time and opportunity to watch all episodes in succession. All this applies to the series in question, where the cast is evenly strong (well, Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan and Liev Schreiber as Raymond Ray Donovan stick out still), and the situations and relations get complicated a lot, without becoming airy-fairy, and the nature of Ray\'s duties and his big family enable to deal with dozens of different mini-scenes. Perhaps too much for some, but I personally liked to follow what happened in different places at the same time. Moreover, in many situations, I could ponder on and over complex issues, how/if I could resolve such a situation, and have some sympathy with characters even when the situation was unpleasant or even rude...Good job, and I am looking for the next season already.'""
'So I first rated this an 8 which felt perfect but as time has passed the visuals and production have stayed with me the show managed to create an experience -it was an experience to watch this.\nI experienced ( it was a feast for the eyes ) and many of the less Integral messages have also stayed with me . The production was excellent'
""'It seems possible that Netflix presented the writers with algorithm results from their viewer rating system and said, OK. Here\'s the budget. Here\'s what our viewers in this demographic want. Go write a series. Frankly, I expected better from Tykwer and The Wachowski\'s. The star of this series is its cinematography. That earned my vote, which would have been much lower without it. The cast is a mixed bag. Miguel Silvestre, a.k.a. Sex-on-a-Spoon, is not only amazingly photogenic but perhaps the most talented. Aml Amen, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt carry their weight in that order. Jaime Clayton is in way over her head. It\'s hard to watch her squeeze out an emotion at times. And who doesn\'t like watching a skinny girl, played by Doona Bae, kick bully ass? Now that\'s entertainment. The plot 1s part Twin Peaks, part Twighlight Saga and part mishegas. The pseudo-science is really obnoxious at times. The concept of yet another superior subgroup in human society wears badly, especially when these special people blow less special people up or shoot them in the face. But they sure are a sexy bunch, and that\'s what really propels this series. It\'s a hedonistic pleasure, like all the recreational drugs that are seemingly admired by the writers.'""
""Well this was beautifully done. The sets, the cast, the imagery. They could have done with a little less , I can't believe I am saying this , but visually it was a lot to take in - i am so visually appreciative when it comes to shows and how do I say - this was stunning (but for me) too gratuitously so. It pushed the bounds of my comfort level. I have to give it the solid 8 I liked the characters, became enmeshed in their plights the story was a good one , the filler was the best ever really but somehow I felt there was money and talent to create these over the top montage type (Isn't the word but like that) scenes) i I give it a solid 8, pardon the pun it was well done but I had trouble suggesting it. Not at all because of the political it whatever you call it tendencies if characters etc that was reasonable and I liked the representation of the many cultures and people , it was elaborate in that way. I mean what more could I want ? It had everything!""
""'I\'m sorry but I couldnt even make it through the first episode with everybody humpin around! I\'ve never SEEN a show with SO MUCH sex! And you think they\'d be trying to draw in viewership in the first episode!!! But by the time I cut it off, I\'d already seen 3 instances of sex, a guy humping a wall, a couple having sex, and 2 women having EXTREMELY EXPLICIT sex!!! I thought I\'d rented this from the back room of the video store!!! Needless to say, I was HIGHLY offended by the amount of sex, if a writer has to pad their script with THAT MUCH sex, then they have NO confidence in their writing skills/ storyline. I thought this was supposed to be some big, innovative series, but I can see now why it got cancelled so quickly! I would have cancelled it after the first episode! The storyline is just WEAK, the acting SUCKS, the locations are great, but that won\'t save them from the sinking ship. This is the S.S Sens 8 Titanic!!'""
""The creator of this amazing show is a true visionary.He brings to life the vision of a greater future of connectedness, acceptance and unity in a way no other show I've ever seen does it.I'm not gonna go into the story itsself, many other reviews have done this.All I want is ask: What prejudices do you and I have? In what ways can you and I get rid of these prejudices? Why not be open and curious instead of hatefull and narrow-minded?ps: The -1 star is for the massive overuse of slow-mo kissing scenes and a rushed, but thankfully still enjoyable and somewhat satisfying finale.""
""'Grimm is one of the coolest representations of Portland. Like Portlandia, it shows the City of Roses at its quirkiest. The focus is a police detective who is a descendant of beings who kept a balance between humans and mythological beings, and so he can see monsters who appear as humans to everyone else. So whenever there\'s a string of bizarre murders or kidnappings, he knows what\'s up. With the help of his lupine friend, the detective keeps Portland safe (and weird). Meanwhile, there are secondary story lines that reach all the way to Austria.It\'s just a really good show. It demonstrates that when Hollywood puts its mind to it, it creates shows that are worth watching. I think that you\'ll like the show.PS: Another Grimm is a Dutch movie about a pair of siblings who escape a dangerous situation a la Hansel and Gretel...only then it turns out that the main part of the movie hasn\'t even started.'""
""'Sure it is a Science Fiction show. But it is like fairy tales that pop up and come out for real, literally. As Detective Nick Burkhardt is a homicide cop who finds out he is a hunter called a Grimm who fights supernatural forces, one of the last of them in line.He fights down creatures that are usually called Wesens. Despite being friends with Monroe, played by the great Silas Weir Mitchell who is one of them.In addition to his great job, and a great partner in Hank Mitchell, played by Russell Hornsby. And an understanding captain, Sasha Rotz also a Wesen. He has a lovely fiancÃÂ©e named Juilette played by Bitsie Tulloch. All three did not know about his real nature of a Grim until later in the second season.He had his mom fight with him, an original Grimm played by movie actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.It is like fairy tales that are coming to life there.'""
""Grimm was entertaining and fun for the first couple of seasons, when it focused on the simple monster-of-the-week stories. Unfortunately too many story-lines about the powerful royal family of vessen, the reapers, the vessen-grimm politics, and the vessen-killing military cult got introduced. The show got ridiculous and annoying.Nick's wife became a central figure, a lot of insanely off-the-rails things happened to her, and her character was a big drag on the show, in my humble opinion. Claire Coffey was another character that became a drag because she was sleeping with every main character and having kids with them and Grimm became a soap opera about sleeping around, pregnancy clinics, parenting training, and family dynamics.The last couple of seasons were really hard to watch. Grimm became Dr. Phil's Monster Families.""
I just binged both seasons and if they don't make another season I'd be absolutely fine with that.The cinematography is excellent and the performances are consistently brilliant.The plot is weaker than a dead wife's fragile torso.It tries to be sociopolitical instead of just telling a story.It breaks off into so many unnecessary tangents that I found myself not caring what happened to most of the characters.Just give me a Mad Sweeney and Dead Wife road story and bin everything else unless you plan to use Crispin Glover properly.
""A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later.""
""Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!""
