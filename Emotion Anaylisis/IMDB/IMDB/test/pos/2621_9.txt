["On the day of its premiere, my movie theatre-working friend and I decided to watch computer-animated Megamind this afternoon. The story seems to be another Superman parody/tribute as we see the origins of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and the title character (Will Ferrell). Then when they've grown into the hero/villain they become, a reporter named Roxanne (Tina Fey) gets mixed in. But after that, many twists and turns come that take many humorous and even touching scenes entertainingly through a, what seems, a naturally organic plane. And they mostly seem to earn every highly amused and heartfelt emotion I got out of it all. And watching all those action scenes in 3-D added immensely to the experience. Kudos to all for a such wonderful experience provided to my friend and I. So yes, I highly recommend Megamind."]
