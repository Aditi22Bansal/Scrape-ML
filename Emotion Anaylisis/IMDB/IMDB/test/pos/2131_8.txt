["Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.The trouble with writing a review for this film is that I risk giving too much away, so I will just not say anything at all. The creators -- Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon -- have taken the horror genre and turned it on its head. The themes that have been done to death are satirized here while maintaining a scary atmosphere.What a shame that this film got caught up in MGM's financial problems and took almost three years to get released. Chris Hemsworth needs more exposure, and Richard Jenkins never disappoints."]
