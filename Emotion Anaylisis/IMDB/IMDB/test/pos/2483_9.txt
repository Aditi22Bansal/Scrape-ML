['Based on the diaries of real Long Beach, California students. Hilary Swank is flawless as the passionate and overly dedicated teacher Erin Gruwell. Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach in the mid 90\'s was comprised of street tough students...the majority Latino, Black and Asian. Some were pure street gangsters; some just abused and or forgotten. The sometimes \'goody-goody\' Gruwell provided a cease-fire zone for her English class students that felt like castaways from their homes as well as certain school faculty. Gruwell sacrificed her own home life and husband(Patrick Dempsey)to save these young people. She helped them reclaim their lives by providing them with journals to write their innermost thoughts, life secrets and hopes and dreams. Erin Gruwell used the Holocaust as her tool to bring awareness to racism and respect for humanity. Based on the book "The Freedom Writers Diary" by Gruwell and her class, this movie is a must see. Any classroom would find something to learn from this film. Kudos to director and screen writer Richard LaGravenese. Also in the cast are: Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton, Deance Wyatt, April Lee Hernandez and Kristin Herrera.']
