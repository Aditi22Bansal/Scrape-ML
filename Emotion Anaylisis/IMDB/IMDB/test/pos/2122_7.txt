["Adrenaline-pumping, heart-thumping, nerve-racking, spine-chilling - you will experience totality in this movie wrongly called as the Project X.Debut cast is epic and appreciate the producers for this noble idea. Animal House is surely reincarnated, so is the usual teenage comedy genre. Todd Phillips is a maverick when it comes to on the road, off the road movies with Hangover & Due Date in his credit, Project X is just another feather in his hat. Screenplay is perfect.Elements, except that of drug were totally binding and each event gives you more stuffs to enjoy and speculate what might happen next. Lots of teenage fun, naked bodies, madness and total anarchy is what the lead character Thomas's house is full of. Even the police are intimidated at one point. Such a ridiculously enthralling movie, Project X is recommended to everyone out there - young & old!WATCH OUT FOR: The beat soundtrack!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
