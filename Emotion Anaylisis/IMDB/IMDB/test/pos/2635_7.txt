["As is the case with most disaster films, there are excellent special effects here. Imagine, the South Pole moves into Wisconsin!The picture itself is one big clich√©. We have a family trying to escape the turmoil. What makes it ironic is that the couple are divorced and they're fleeing along with her current husband. With renewed love and anxiety, you know where this is going.Of course, we see cohesiveness and respect for our fellow human beings as the story unfolds. Naturally, there is Oliver Platt, a government official who is mainly out for his own survival under the guise of the fact that government must continue.Our own U.S. President succumbs for humanity. The kids do a lot of screaming as the world geologically falls apart. This is 2012, wait until the presidential election!"]
