["Several weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio won his Best Actor Oscar for this movie, I finally got to see The Revenant with my movie theatre-working friend (who had watched this previously a few weeks ago) just now. DiCaprio played Hugh Glass, a trapper who was left for dead from several men including Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, who is revealed to be quite selfish most of the time. Hardy also gave a fine performance that also got him an Oscar nomination though he lost to Mark Ryland in The Bridge of Spies. Anyway, the nature shots taking place in winter look rough most of the time, appropriately so, so to speak. Oh, and that sequence involving that bear looked really brutal, that's for sure! So on that note, I definitely recommend The Revenant unless that bear sequence makes you squeamish..."]
