["Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, an extraordinary fairy tale set in 1940's Spain.. A quiet, free thinking young girl Ofelia(Ivana Baquero)is forced to move with her pregnant mother to the compound of her adoptive father Captain Vidal(Sergi Lopez), who is a ruthless fascist still hunting rebels in the surrounding woody region. The throes of the Spanish Civil War lingers and young Ofelia's imagination lets her inter a world where she is a Princess of a land sheltered by a labyrinth of ancient natural rock. Graphic violence and strange, but interesting CGI creatures. Kudos to cinematographer Guillermo Navarro. Other cast members: Maribel Verdu, Doug Jones, Alex Angulo, Ariadna Gil and Manolo Solo. This movie is well worth all honors bestowed."]
