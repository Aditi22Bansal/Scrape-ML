["The Coleman family have had problems (Mom's alcoholism, the near death of deaf daughter Max, stillbirth of baby Jessica) and, as a move to overcome these family wounds, they adopt Russian orphan Esther. She's very bright and intelligent, but there's something about her, as Mom Kate gradually comes to realise. Dad John can't see it, though.You're never quite certain what genre this film occupies, but it doesn't matter. It gets most of the clich√©s - jarring music, people suddenly appearing in mirrors, sudden loud noises etc. - out of the way early on and, for the last half or more, it's simply nerve-shreddingly tense and quite brutal on the audience. I wouldn't want to say more - this is not a film to give away too much to others about.The cast is excellent, but the three main youngsters are awesome - stunningly good.If you like movies which put you through the ringer, then this is one for you."]
