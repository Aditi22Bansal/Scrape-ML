["From the makers of THE INCREDIBLES and CARS a comedy with a little of this and a touch of that and enough for seconds. Its a view of Paris that begins ...under the city. Remy(Patton Oswalt)is a determined rat with big ambitions of becoming a great French chef. Fate places Remy and his family in the Parisian sewer system right beneath a restaurant made famous by Remy's hero, Auguste Gusteau(Brad Garrett). Torn between his own dreams and his family's wishes, Remy and a hapless human pal named Linguini(Lou Romano)set in motion events that will have the elite of Paris diners clamoring for just a taste of new culinary concoctions. Other recognizable voices bringing life to these new characters are: Peter O'Toole, Janeane Garofalo, John Ratzenberger and Brian Dennehy."]
