["I was really reluctant in seeing this movie, but am glad I viewed it. It is rib-cracking funny. Doug(Justin Bartha) is getting married in two days, so his best friends Phil(Bradley Cooper)and dentist Stu(Ed Helms) decide to throw a bachelor party of shots, strippers and debauchery in Las Vegas. There's a problem before the trip even begins, Doug's future brother-in-law Alan(Zach Gallfanekis)decides he's going to tag along. And Alan is wired on the freakish side. The party boys wake up in their Caesar's Palace villa with a hell-of-a hangover. Not only are their heads addled, but something is amiss. Stu has a tooth missing. There is a tiger in the bathroom and a newborn baby in the closet. Oh yes, Doug is missing.There is no recollection of what happened before they passed out. If they can piece things together, they may be able to find the groom.Hilarious naughty sequences. Revelation of the night's events are outrageous, if not interesting. Finding their missing pal is an adventure in itself. And I found the wedding singer and his lyrics very inappropriate and knee-slapping funny. You may need to watch a second time to glean all of the off-color humor. I found Helms to be a down-right hoot. Also in the cast: Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, Mike Tyson, Jeffrey Tambor and Sasha Barrese."]
