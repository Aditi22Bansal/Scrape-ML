["Awesome, terrific, epic, gruesome, this is the hell of a movie, where Dick Sarafian's MAN IN THE WILDERNESS would meet Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, in the style and directing scheme I mean. I understand though that most people don't like it. yes, you are shocked by viewing such a masterpiece, and the bear fight is absolutely unforgettable, but I don't think any one on earth could survive after such an assault. But the CGI effects are one hundred percent efficient."]
