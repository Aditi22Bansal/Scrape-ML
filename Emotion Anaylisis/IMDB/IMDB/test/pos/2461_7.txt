["Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) abandoned his life, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to Oxfam International and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness after graduating from Emory University. He has always been uncomfortable with material things, and decide to leave that life completely behind. He has some profound experiences along the way to his bus in the Alaskan wilderness.Director Sean Penn adapts Jon Krakauer's novel. This movie is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. This is a beautiful performance from Emile Hirsch. He embodies the role so completely. Sean Penn is able to infuse this movie with the same wanderlust that the real Christopher must have had. And Kristen Stewart has a great minor role. We really have a profound into the wild experience."]
