["It's one of those guilty films I've watched with the kids, but secretly enjoyed as much, if not more then they did. The animation is fantastic, the voice overs terrific, but it's the humour that still stands out, it is so wonderfully funny. It has a nice message too, one hopefully kids can see and accept. Count Dracula has never ever been so cool. Classic Halloween choice. 9/10"]
