['If you can get your head around the fact, that this is called "Dawn of the Dead" but is more an action movie, rather than a horror movie. Hence do not compare this with the original (Romero) Dawn! It works pretty good as an action movie. Zombies that can run, may or may not be your thing (I\'m still with the slow ones). Social criticism has gone (almost completely) AWOL, but it is still nice to see at least one familiar face (Ken Foree that is).I really dug this movie although I am really big fan of the Original. But as I have said before, you can\'t compare the movies. And even though I haven\'t seen the Day of the Dead remake (haven\'t heard nothing good about it at all), I\'m pretty sure this is one of the better remakes of Romero movie (even or because it does not try to imitate it).']
