["The premise of a one week break from married life is the story for Hall Pass. The Brothers take a shot married life and succeed. There are many laugh out loud moments almost throughout the movie. It is really the Brothers best in a while. Put it after Something About Mary and Shallow Hal. There is a satisfying story always a moral. It's risqu√© without being crude even though there is some toilet humor. Also it's never painful to watch. Jokes are fresh and even though you can guess the outcome it's just really enjoyable to see how you get there. It's one of those comedies that is funny even if you watch it a second time because there are so many good lines.With this cast you can't go wrong. Owen is always charmingly droll. He even has a middle aged spread to boot. His awkward dance and pickup moves are endearing. Sudekis is a bit common looking but he's good for the part. Applegate is spot on. She really needs to get more big screen comedic roles - she is so good and very pretty. Fisher is a bit laid back but suitable. There are some familiar Farrelly Bros supporting cast. Some new faces like the Aussie temptation and the babysitter are great too.The visit The Shallow Hal like part in the bar with Richard Jenkins is hilarious. The visit to the new house of their friend is good to.Worth watching - ignore the bad reviews."]
