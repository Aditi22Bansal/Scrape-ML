["HALL PASS (2011) *** Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate, Nicky Whelan, Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell, JB Smoove, Joy Behar, Richard Jenkins, Kathy Griffin (cameo as herself). The Farrely Brothers are back to true-form in this frequently hilarious comedy about two married buddies (Wilson & Sudeikis having a field day) who are given a quasi 'diplomatic immunity' for a week from their wives (Fischer & Applegate) to endure the titular rite of passage with atypical mix of heart and raunch in the mix from the sibling filmmakers (who collaborated on the script with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett). Best bit â€“ stay for the closing credits for Merchant's pausing to contemplate his wife's suggestion to follow suit."]
