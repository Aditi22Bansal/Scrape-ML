['Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven\'t seen "What we do in the shadows", I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it\'s more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it\'s always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it\'s Phase 3 already if I\'m not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don\'t be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is']
