['"Carrie" - probably more than any other movie - shows that even in the worst situations, we\'ve all got the power in us; granted, most people probably don\'t have telepathy.Anyway, this first adaptation from a Stephen King novel was done perfectly, with Sissy Spacek as the mousy but deadly Carrie White. Everyone in the movie does a top-notch performance: Piper Laurie as Carrie\'s disturbed, fundamentalist Christian mother Margaret; Betty Buckley as gym teacher Ms. Collins, who befriends Carrie; William Katt as the clement Tommy Ross, taking Carrie to the prom; Nancy Allen as the despicable Chris Hargenson, wanting nothing except to brutalize Carrie; Amy Irving as the circumspect Sue Snell; and even a young John Travolta as Chris\' crony Billy Nolan.The most famous scene is of course the prom scene, where Chris and Billy go a little too far in their vile plans, leading Carrie to do something that no one will ever forget. And believe you me, you won\'t forget it either. You shouldn\'t forget it, because "Carrie" is one movie that everyone should see. 10/10.']
