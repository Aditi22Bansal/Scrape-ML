['As far as I\'m concerned, "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" was more like Dorian Gray having a positive life.With his life in reverse, Brad Pitt, who played Benjamin, did an excellent job of conveying the problems of being born elderly but progressing through the years as a younger man. In the end, he has had a fulfilled life, but has to suffer the indignities of dementia as a young lad.The make-up artist for Mr. Pitt certainly deserved some sort of accolade, especially in his work with Pitt as an older man.A dying woman conveys the story to her daughter via a diary, and the young girl learns that Pitt was her father.There are other excellent performances by Cate Blanchett, as the woman who loved him dearly, and Taranji Henson, as the black woman who took him in and raised him in his "elderly" years.']
