['This is a funny movie with a good premise where the leads work well together. Anna Ferris decides she\'s to the point where she\'s reached her point where she\'s slept with "enough" men and needs neighbor Chris Evans\'s help in tracking down her exes in finding "Mr. Right." You know how it\'s going to turn out, but you have fun getting there. The scenes with the exes are absolutely hilarious, and Anna and Chris work well together. I also like the wedding scenes and the part at the beginning where she gets fired from her job. If you like comedies, this is perfect for you! I loved it and thought it was a harmless time-killer.*** out of ****']
