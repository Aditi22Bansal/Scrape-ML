["A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets waylaid in Radiator Springs on his way to California. He's a brash self-obsessed car mired in a dispute in the racing world. But when he damages the road and is sentenced to repair it, he must slow down, work hard, and find what's truly important in life.Pixar creates another fun franchise. This time the cars are humanized. Like Toy Story, it's always about the characters. It's a great family movie. It has fun but it's also a message movie. The breakout character of this movie must be Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old rusty tow truck. He's definitely the comic relief."]
