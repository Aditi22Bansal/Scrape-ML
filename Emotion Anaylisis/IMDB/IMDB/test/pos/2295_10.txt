["Clever director David Fincher adapts Swede Stieg Larsson's novel, the first of a trilogy of chillers. A disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig), accepts a job writing a biography of a wealthy industrialist; but actually is hired to solve the mystery of the patriarch's niece's disappearance...40 years ago. Most of the family live scattered on a small island and very few speak to each other, if at all. Mikeal will need the aid of bi-sexual, tattooed, punk computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander(Rooney Mara). It is very hard to keep a good girl down and this job will require every talent she has. The journalist and hacker work outstandingly well together. Their investigation will involve looking at decades of business records and analyzing old photos. The pair will uncover massive corruption and family portrayals like you couldn't believe. Secrets die hard. Some scenery is high maintenance; and some of my favorite scenes involve snowy landscapes. The violence does not necessarily pack a punch; but the sex scenes leave very little to the imagination. You will be eager in waiting for the second and third installments. Rounding out the cast: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson and Geraldine James."]
