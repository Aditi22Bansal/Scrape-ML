['The smalltime thief Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) lives stealing steel, bronze and copper material from the streets of Los Angeles and is seeking a job. When he sees a freelance cameraman filming an accident, he decides to invest money in a camcorder and a police scanner radio from a pawn shop. He overhears the name of Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who is responsible for the TV news of a television station and he sells his first footage. Louis learns how to improve his films and hires the homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed) to help him. When his competitor Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) discloses his new van and equipment to Louis, he sabotages his van, causing a serious accident. The ambitious Louis is a sociopath and for him gore means a better payment for his footages. So he leaves the position of crime photographer to interfere in crime scenes, climbing in his new career. "Nightcrawler" is a weird and original movie with one of the bleakest characters that I have recently seen on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal has an impressive performance in the role of an ambitious sociopath that is capable to do anything to climb in his new job. The plot is totally unpredictable and mesmerizes the viewer that can not foresee the next move of Louis. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Abutre" ("The Volture")']
