['. . . the population of Juarez, Mexico, and any other non-Americans currently within 100 miles of the U.S. fence far enough south so that they\'re no longer within this international buffer zone. If we were being informed of what\'s ACTUALLY happening in places such as Chandler, AZ (where SICARIO shows how Mexican cartel members slaughtered 42 random American collegians and dry-walled them in a single suburban home in observance of pagan customs) EVERY U.S. citizen (except maybe those like the sniveling, bleeding-heart, "by-the-book" FBI agent cry-baby and drug-lord enabler played in SICARIO by Emily Blunt) would be demanding AT LEAST a 100-mile-wide No Go Zone down South. As SICARIO proves, our "border" presently is riddled with drug terrorist tunnels, and any crime-lord committing genocide against America can buy his way out of detention by bribing the "authorities" of this totally corrupt society (as happened this summer with the prison tunnel guy). Maybe some Americans have forgotten that we already have "won" the entire "nation" of Mexico in the Battle of Vera Cruz. As the U.N. mandates, "to the victor go the spoils." That 100-mile-wide No-Go buffer zone now features little but squalor and human suffering. When it\'s totally depopulated (and policed 24/7/365 by the U.S. Air Force and drone program), Americans will be MUCH better off, and Mexicans won\'t be any worse. See SICARIO--and vote for change!']
