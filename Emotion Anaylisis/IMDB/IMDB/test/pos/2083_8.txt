["Excellent film dealing with a dwarf who passes herself off as a 9 year old. If that isn't enough, she is criminally insane and utterly wreaks havoc on those who take her in.Miss Fuhrman is excellent as the supposed 9 year old. As Esther, she can be charming, polite and well-mannered. Watch her develop into an absolute monster as the film progresses. She is so manipulative.The part I really liked was where the psychiatrist was totally taken in by this person. She actually blames the adopted mother for what is going on.The film highlights how out-of-country adoptions can be so very dangerous.The family is caught in a vicious web. This person will do whatever is necessary, no matter how bad it is, to attain her goals."]
