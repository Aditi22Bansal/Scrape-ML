['Vladislav, Viago, Deacon, and Petyr (Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh, and Ben Fransham) are flatmates. Oh, and they\'re also vampires.Filmed by a documentary crew, our nocturnal friends go through their nightly routines. Their personalities are quite different, which makes them more interesting. Vladislav is the Dracula-type (Think: Vlad The Impaler), looking and sounding very Transylvanian. Viago is more of a gentle sort, not wanting to cause problems. He was a "dandy" when he was alive. Deacon is the more "cool", "hip" bloodsucker. If Keith Moon had become a vampire, this is what he would be! He knits his own sweaters as well. Petyr is the classic Nosferatu of the group, sealed in his concrete coffin in the cellar.As we watch these undead, they take us along on a dark journey into... hilarity! WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the best mockumentaries since THIS IS SPINAL TAP. As interesting as it is uproarious, it\'s certainly better than any "real" reality TV show.Some highlights include: Group discussions about the household chores, encounters with the local werewolf pack, the "human" incident at The Unholy Masquerade, and many more!For lovers of humor, who happen to like vampires too. The perfect Halloween confection!...']
