["A half dozen of adventurous young ladies opt to go spelunking in Chattooga National Park. Rather than go to the designated cave, the leader takes them to a cave that has not been explored before. A cave-in traps them and forces them to go farther into the cave in hopes of discovering another way out. And wouldn't you know it, this is the cave that has man-eating hominoids with big ugly teeth.It was a fairly interesting film that has stood the test of time. There is some drama and tension between the ladies.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."]
