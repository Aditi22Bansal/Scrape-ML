['Although Paul Feig\'s "Bridesmaids" is known as a chick flick, you have to accept the occasional crude humor to truly like it. I liked it. Melissa McCarthy\'s character is the really funny one, but Kristen Wiig certainly does some neat things, especially on the airplane. This is one of those movies that represents some of the best that comedy can be. It\'s true that there have been a ton of comedies centering on weddings, but this one knows how to time everything perfectly. It is, for lack of a better description, a very good movie, and you\'re sure to like it whether you\'re a man or a woman.And remember, be careful of food poisoning.']
