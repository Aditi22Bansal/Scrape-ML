['Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protégée of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other "rat"."The Departed" is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even "Donnie Brasco" is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichés and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Os Infiltrados" ("The Infiltrated")']
