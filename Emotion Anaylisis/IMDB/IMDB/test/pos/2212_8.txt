["The rituals of Halloween were devised to protect us from evil, and one small town is about to be taught a lesson that some traditions are best not forgotten.A suburban couple learn the dangers of blowing out a Jack-o-Lantern before midnight.Four women cross paths with a costumed stalker at a local festival, a group of pranksters goes too far and discovers the horrifying truth buried in a local legend, And finally, a cantankerous old hermit is visited by a strange trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.....It's a strange but brilliant anthology, this way underrated, and overlooked little gem.Imagine Joe Dante crossed with Leigh Whannel, and you have this movie which is more treat than trick.Usually with anthology movies, you have one slightly dud story, but here, they are all interwoven seamlessly, and the wealth of talent here only adds to the joy.While not necessarily scary, it's referential to the whole horror genre, but you wouldn't know this, because the references are so intricate, they are pretty hard to spot.The whole movie has a sort of childlike feel to it, almost like The Twilight Zone movie from 1983, this makes the flashes of gore more stark and noteworthy.All in all, it's a great movie to watch at this time of the year, as much as Home Alone is to watch at Christmas."]
