['CRIMSON PEAK (2015) *** Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnan, Jim Beaver, Burn Gorman, Leslie Hope, Doug Jones, Jonathan Hyde, Bruce Gray. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro\'s lavish, epic homage to Gothic horror and Poe\'s "Fall of the House of Usher" echoes in this impeccably produced yet middling rote ghost story circa 19th century New York with Wasikowska finding her haunted life further enhanced after being swept off her feet by Brit Hiddleston who has a secret agenda of deadly proportions. Beautiful production design by Thomas E. Sanders and luscious cinematography by Dan Lausten heighten the average storyline to new depths of horror and a teeth-gnashing, crazed turn by Chastain as Hiddleston\'s over-sexed, angry sibling is definitely just cause to be afraid.']
