['If The Amazing Spiderman from 2012 felt like an unnecessary reboot so soon after the original trilogy was completed then this sequel is not going raise much hope for this cycle of films.Andrew Garfield is certainly a zippy and smart Alec web spinner, Emma Stone is an appealing Gwen Stacy but then you rush into the villains where character development reminded more of Batman & Robin.Harry Osborn is introduced as the new heir of Oscorp and a good friend of Peter Parker, something not mentioned in the previous film. Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.']
