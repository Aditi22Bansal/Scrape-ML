["Overblown and a bit silly, but more than enough rousing CGI action to hold your interest. Scripted chaos with elementary cheesy dialogue. Let your eyes overrule your brain and VAN HELSING is a never-ending battle against the forces of evil. Fabled monster hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman)is summoned to take on Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and a somewhat redefined Count Dracula(Richard Roxburgh). First he has to deal with Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane)in a bell tower. Upon arriving in Transylvania he enters a love/hate relationship with Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale)and together they battle lovely swift-winged female vampires and deal with Anna's brother who has become a werewolf.My favorite scene is of the horse drawn carriage winding and navigating snow covered Transylvania and jumping the destroyed bridge. I also liked watching Van Helsing blow holes in the voluptuous vampires with his gas powered spear gun. Also in the cast are: David Wenham, Elena Anaya, Kevin J. O'Connor and Will Kemp. Jackman seems to come off as a poor man's Indiana Jones. And not to take anything away from the attractive Beckinsale...but give her role to Catherine Zeta-Jones and you'll have a more spectacular movie."]
