['In Hogwarts, three different wizard schools compete in a dangerous competition called the Triwizard Tournament. The minimum age to participate is seventeen years old, but fourteen years old Harry Potter mysterious application is selected by the Goblet of Fire to be part of the game. Meanwhile, Harry Potter has dark nightmares, while Voldemort\'s Death Eaters are preparing the return of the evil Lord Voldemort."Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" is the weakest Harry Potter\'s movie, but it is still good. The plot with the very hazardous competition and the winter ball is very silly, and the strong part of the screenplay is the return of Lord Voldemort and his duel with Harry Potter. Anyway, the state-of-art effects, the charming characters and the constellation of actors and actresses make this movie a great entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Harry Potter e o CÃ¡lice de Fogo" ("Harry Potter and the Chalice of Fire")']
