['"The Greatest Showman" is a highly entertaining musical based on highlights of the life of the American entertainer P.T. Barnum, but never in his biography. The dramatization, art direction, cast and the choreography are excellent and the result may be not what the "professional critics" expect to see (like the snobbish character in the film), but certainly will be very pleasant for the audiences where I include myself. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Rei do Show" ("The King of the Show")']
