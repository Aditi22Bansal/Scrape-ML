["Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) lives with his father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after a stay at a mental hospital. His friend Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker) is also a patient. He is introduced to depressed widower Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who is dealing by having casual sex. He reluctantly agrees to join her in a dance competition.As a rom-com, it's fun and functional. Cooper and Lawrence are two performers overflowing with charm. As a family drama dealing with mental illness, it doesn't hurt to have De Niro. As a comedy, it's got a few good laughs. What puts it over the top is Jennifer Lawrence. She's electric as soon as she shows up in the movie. She has some great exchanges with Bradley Cooper.If there is any complaint, it's that there seems to be some missing scenes that's usually needed in rom-com. The movie is already 2hrs long, so I can understand some scenes were trimmed. The deleted scenes section has the necessary bits. Check it out. This is definitely worthy of recommendation."]
