["Queen, arguably the best group of all time, get a movie which does that great band justice. Anyone that loves the band, Freddie, or just movie making at its finest, then this film is definitely for you. I'll admit I was sceptical, and am late going to see it, foolishly, because this was one of the best films I have seen in years, it's moving, it's funny, interesting, and as it showcases their best music, it's a musical feast also. People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and in particular the performance of Rami Malek, who is nothing short of sensational as the fabulous frontman, the supporting cast are sensational too, Gwilym Lee, who I know from Midsomer Murders was a revelation as Brian May. I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.Bravo. 10/10"]
