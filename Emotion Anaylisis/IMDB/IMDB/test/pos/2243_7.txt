["This film tells the story of a retired assassin who is forced out of hiding by a gangster's son who doesn't know who he is messing with.I watched the sequel first then this film, and I think this film is more realistic than the sequel. At least in here John Wick gets hurt! It is stylish and is fun to watch."]
