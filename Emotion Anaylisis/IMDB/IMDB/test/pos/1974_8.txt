['I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip, she doesn\'t care for scary movies.John Krasinski wrote, directed, and has a lead role here as Lee Abbott. His real life wife, Emily Blunt, is his wife Evelyn Abbott. They also have a deaf daughter and two young sons.As the movie opens we see shadowy figures quietly moving through what appears to be an abandoned store. Then we see that the whole town appears dead, but this family has a home and small farm outside town. On the screen flashes brief messages, like "89 days" or "492 days", presumably since the alien monsters attacked and killed most people. These monsters are very fast and vicious, but they can\'t see, only detecting possible prey by hearing sounds. So everyone is very quiet, conversing mostly in sign language.Of course there wouldn\'t be much story if the people remained quiet and undetected, and if the monsters never were able to find them. So things do develop and as the movie ends it sets itself up for a possible sequel. The family does find the monster\'s "Kryptonite", very high pitched sound.And in fact the IMDb has a listing for the sequel now in pre production. Suitably interesting movie.']
