["The films in this new monster universe haven't impressed me much at all thus far, but the action does seem to be consistently entertaining. With Godzilla vs Kong, it's no different. Do I care about a single moment of human characters during this film? Absolutely not. Is the action exceptionally good? 100%. And that's just how these films go unfortunately. Take that for what you will.6.5/10."]
