["Given her penchant for appearing in things like Lara Croft, Salt, etc, and my preference for real films I have only seen Angelina Jolie in one movie, Changeling, in which I thought she was excellent. I think she also does a good job as the eponymous Maleficent where, coincidentally, an arguably finer actress than Jolie, Lesley Manville, is wasted in a joke role which is underwritten to boot. It's a nice take on The Sleeping Beauty though the song from the original Disney animated version, Once Upon A Dream may well be lost on younger viewers who were not going to movies in the early fifties - and while we're about it whose bright idea was it to drop Tchaikovsky's name as composer. The film is shot in somber tones so that even the few scenes that call for sunlight are muted. Definitely rates a look."]
