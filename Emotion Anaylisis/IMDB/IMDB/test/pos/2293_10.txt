['Let me start with: I don\'t like "reality TV" at all. And there is a reason you have to put "", because it is anything but real. And while this isn\'t real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least "at home". And it shows, because of the chemistry they have. This is very well written and acted. Comedy timing is essential and in this case awesome.']
