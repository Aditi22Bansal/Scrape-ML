["It's been a few years. The gang decides to set up camp at the White House. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) is tired of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson)'s fatherly advices. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) proposes to Wichita (Emma Stone) which only drives her away. The sisters leave and Little Rock finds pacifist Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a boy at her own age. Columbus finds clueless Madison (Zoey Deutch) who had been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Little Rock runs off with Berkeley and Wichita goes in pursuit joined by the boys and Madison. Tallahassee encounters fellow Elvis fanatic Nevada (Rosario Dawson) and doppelganger Albuquerque (Luke Wilson). Columbus has his own doppelganger Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch).The original is irreverent fun. This one has the gang returning along with some very funny new side characters. This might have a few more laughs than the first one. I really like Madison and I wish she stayed with the group from start to finish. She's great at needling Wichita and the Uber bit is hilarious. The funniest bit has to be the introduction of Albuquerque and Flagstaff and I laughed hard. I would do some different things with the ending but I do like the Buffalo Jump. Overall, this is a great sequel which is just as much fun if not more than the original."]
