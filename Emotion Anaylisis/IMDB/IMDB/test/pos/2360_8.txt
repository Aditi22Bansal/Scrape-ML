["In ordinary circumstances, I don't crave for action flicks where super heroes fight against very evil guys with highly expected results. But this film is the exception. It reminds me many late eighties and early nineties action movies produced by Joel Silver, such as the LETHAL WEAPON or DIE HARD series, or even LAST BOYSCOUT. These were perfectly done, absolutely flawless. Like this one.Denzel Washngton is terrific, action sequences astounding and the bad guys outstanding, especially the new comer whose I certainly won't forget the face. The face to face between him and Washington is awesome, as I LOVE SOOOOO MUCH!!!Even everything here is predictable, it is, I repeat, so well done, in a so professional way: film making, acting, screen writing, editing.And, above all, there is not here any silly, stupid, run of the mill f...romance stuff for sissies. Just touching moments. A movie may be poignant without being marsh mallow. But there are here some missing sequences; such as this one, just after the armed robbery at the store where Washington works, a robbery where the Hood takes the female employee's ring. Washington let him go, runs to take a big hammer, and the scene after he brings the ring back without any explanation... You have here some short cuts as this one. But I assure you that doesn't reduce the quality of this terrific actionner."]
