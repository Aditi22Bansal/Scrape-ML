["This movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.If there is any problem, it's that the ideas behind horcroxes are somewhat confusing. They never really explained it easily or clearly. It's a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job. The most important part is the exciting battles. It's a thrilling end and a satisfying one for fans of the series."]
