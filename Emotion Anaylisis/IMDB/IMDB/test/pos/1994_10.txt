['This is the sequel to the Avenger film which briefly introduced a geeky Spider-Man and not a sequel to the one where they killed off Emma Stone. I apologize if you haven\'t seen that one yet. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is now in NYC and is crushing on Liz (Laura Harrier) who is crushing on Spider-Man...like the Lois Lane thing, but add in High School and teen angst. Spider-Man has a contact man for the Avengers, ironically named Happy (Jon Favreau). Through a mishap, his identity is discovered by a geek friend (Jacob Batalon) who becomes his "chair man." Spider-Man is not yet part of the Avengers as of this time and is still semi-separate from them. The film gives him a powerful enemy (Michael Keaton) but not too powerful, i.e. someone within Spider-man\'s wheelhouse.The ending was slightly unexpected and we find out that Gwyneth Paltrow is not dead. Stan Lee cameo near the beginning.Guide: No sex or nudity. Frequent use of the word "penis" as in \'Penis Parker." A cut WTF at the end.']
