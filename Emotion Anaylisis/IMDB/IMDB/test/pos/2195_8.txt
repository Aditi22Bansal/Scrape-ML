["The Scream franchise roars back with part 4 10 years after a slightly stale part 3 brought the original trilogy to a close.As self referential as ever, part 4 brings Sidney, Dewey and Gale back together as Sidney's autobiographical book tour comes to a close in Woodsboro on the 10th anniversary of the original killings. And, guess what, they start again.The pleasing mix of knowing movie reference, slasher killings, and who-is-it? works as well as ever, thanks to a new crop of suspects who, one by one, become victims. The slaughter is more graphic than before, in keeping with the direction slasher films have move in during the last 10 years. The script is deft, and the guessing is good and constantly misleading! Part 4 happily takes its place alongside the other 3 - it is just as good."]
