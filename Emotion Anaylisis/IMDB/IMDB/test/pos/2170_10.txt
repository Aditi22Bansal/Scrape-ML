["It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X. Overall, it's good bloody brutal violence with a familiar relationship and some new ones."]
