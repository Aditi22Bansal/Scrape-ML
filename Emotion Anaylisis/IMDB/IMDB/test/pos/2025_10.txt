['When a small time pot dealer, David Clark(Jason Sudeikis) is robbed, he is hard pressed to find a way to pay back his supplier. To save his own skin and get back in the good graces of his boss, David agrees to travel to Mexico and smuggle a major stash across the border. He rents an RV and gathers a fake family to use as his cover. His neighbor Rose(Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who just quit her job, is willing to pretend to be his wife...for a fee of course. Rounding out his "new" family will be Kenny(Will Poulter), a shy professed virgin and Casey(Emma Roberts), a street wise runaway. Now the family known as the Millers, on vacation, should make smuggling drugs a bit easier. Well guess again; the dealers in Mexico feel they have given a huge amount of drugs to the wrong person and are in hot pursuit. Along the way, the Millers will meet another RV of vacationers...a DEA agent and his family.Funny situations, pervasive language, drug content, crude sexual scenes with very brief nudity. Of course, my favorite sequence is when Rose must prove to drug dealers that she actually is a stripper. Well done, I must say. And young Mr. Poulter may just be accused of being the scene stealer. He is funny! The cast also includes: Nick Offerman, Tomer Sisley, Molly C. Quinn, Kathryn Hahn and Ed Helms.']
