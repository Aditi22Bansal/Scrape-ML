["So me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this today and like the previous Deadpool, we both highly enjoyed this one as well! There's a tragedy at the beginning but things pick considerably after that. As before, the leading character breaks the fourth wall in his narration and onscreen and other stuff referring to other superhero movies make this quite funny most of the time. Also, we once again see some of the X-Men characters from the previous one appearing to help Deadpool whether he wants it or not as well as some new ones who also are welcome additions. So that's a high recommendation of Deadpool 2 from both of us!"]
