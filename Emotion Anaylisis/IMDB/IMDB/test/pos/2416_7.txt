["Boy, Denzel Washington really uses his acting chops to play such a flawed character who's both heroic and pathetic! I mean, he's a pilot who manages to save most of his passengers on a plane that obviously wasn't very functional when he boarded it despite his drinking and having a snort just several hours ago. That's just for starters on what is perhaps the most compelling dramatic picture of the year directed with a sure hand by Robert Zemeckis in another of his surprise moves since he's usually associated with more commercially entertaining movies like Back to the Furure or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Well, not everything here is meant for serious thinking as John Goodman is a great hoot as his supplier! But just seeing the range Washington displays here is enough for me to highly recommend Flight wholeheartedly. So if you like something more challenging for your brain, see it!"]
