["When I watched this third Iron Man movie with my movie theatre-working friend and his relatives, I had only previously seen the first one so it's possible I was partially confused by some of the characterizations that were portrayed in this entry in the series because of my not seeing the second one yet. Still, I did like many of the action scenes and some of the humor presented here as well as some of the twists concerning some villains and the fate of Pepper Potts. And Robert Downey Jr. is both intense and fun when playing the charismatic Tony Stark with Gwyneth Paltrow still bringing sparks as his loving partner, the aforementioned Ms. Potts. So on that note, I highly enjoyed watching Iron Man Three."]
