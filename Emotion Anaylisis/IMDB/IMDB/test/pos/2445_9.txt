['One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that "Indiana Jones 4" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it\'s a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it\'s very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg\'s deft touch.There\'s a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce\'s high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it\'s a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it\'s some sort of series disgrace. 7/10']
