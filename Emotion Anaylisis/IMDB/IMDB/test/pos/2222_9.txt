['Small-time drug dealer Dave is forced to smuggle a large quantity of drugs into the USA from Mexico. In order to provide a convincing false identity by masquerading as a normal holidaying family in a camper van, he recruits stripper Rose as his wife, and homeless teen Casey and idiot neighbour Kenny as his children. The problem is that none of the four is ideally suited to playing the part of a normal family member and, when they get involved with another holidaying family whose Dad is a Drug Enforcement Agency operative, things get a little tricky.This film - which features a lot of bad language which may, or may not, have a bearing on your enjoyment, is morally questionable but quite likable nevertheless. There is some enjoyable dialogue, a good plot, nice character development arcs, and good playing by the principals, Will Poulter especially.I enjoyed this.']
