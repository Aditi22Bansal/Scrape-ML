['The movie starts off interestingly enough and Andrew Garfield almost falls into the Sam Raimi trap (Spiderman 3) where Tobey Maguire had a sequence where he "tried" to be cool. Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it\'s very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It\'s a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he\'s not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get "unleashed" is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride. With a few surprises along the way ... well at least one for me!']
