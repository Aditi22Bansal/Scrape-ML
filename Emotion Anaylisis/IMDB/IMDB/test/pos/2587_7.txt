['This film tells the story of a fairy who cast a spell out of revenge on the king\'s daughter, who will fall into eternal asleep on her sixteenth birthday."Maleficent" has beautiful visuals. The fairy land scenes are beautiful, and the characters are beautifully designed too. Maleficent\'s look is cold and fierce, yet somewhat noble and not too scary for kids. I like the way the teenage Aurora bonds with Maleficent, it shows that there\'s good in everyone. Just trust and love the people around you, and the world will be a better place. It is an enjoyable story.']
