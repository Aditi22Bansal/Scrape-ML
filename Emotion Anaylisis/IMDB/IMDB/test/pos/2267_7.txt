['In Terrel, the veteran from Vietnam and retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) accidentally finds many trucks and a gang of drug dealers dead while hunting in the desert. Moss discovers also a wallet with two million dollars and decides to bring it home and not report his finding to the police. Meanwhile the owners of the money assign the psychopath killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to chase Moss following the transponder in the wallet and leaving a trail of murders. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), from the third generation of a family of men-of-law, investigates the crimes while questions the momentum of violence of his country."No Country for Old Men" is a pretentious and overrated movie of Ethan and Joel Cohen. The authors blended the old story lines of Sam Raimi\'s "A Simple Plan" with Robert Harmon\'s "The Hitcher" plus some cheap philosophy to write this story. The result is not bad at all, with good performances and an unrecognizable Javier Bardem in the role of a psychopath killer. Unfortunately the story fails with its inconclusive conclusion. Surprisingly this average movie is ranked Top 250 # 79 in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Onde os Fracos NÃ£o Tem Vez" ("Where the Weaks do not Have Chance")']
