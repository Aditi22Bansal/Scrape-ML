["By minute two, I loved this movie and its originality. I loved the setup, the actresses, mainly my new girl-crush: Malin Akerman and the immediate homage to my childhood movies. Thenby minute 5, it shifted and I loved that originality. In fact, let's just say this film rarely let me down.It surely helped that slasher films are my favorite type of horror, not to mention 80s slashers and especially Friday the 13th are king to me. Also, I am very fond of Adam DeVine and the Comedy-Horror meshups, i.e. The Cabin in the Woods, Scary Movie and Student Bodies. So this movie hit all the points.And boy, was it funny. So hilarious at times, I was laughing thoroughly out loud during many of the scenes. It carefully covered the clichés without ever making them clichés themselves – as most of these movies sadly can't overcome, and gave us everything we needed from our slasher fix plus a real and sometime heartfelt story.I will NOT go into the plot or what the movie's about as I went into this movie completely blind. It's perfect to do just that as you never know what to expect.But, suffice to say, if you are a slasher fan, 80s or not and you like a spoof without actually reducing itself just to comedy bits this is the perfect film for you. I cannot see this NOT landing in my top three best list of the year."]
