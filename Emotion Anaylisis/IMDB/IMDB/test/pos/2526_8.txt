['I had the fortune to look behind the scenes of a "puppet" movie. The work and dedication that has to into a production is incredible. To make it work, to give the "items" (animals in this case) emotion and character is anything but easy. You have to care for them, laugh and maybe even cry with them.Something that this movie achieves so easily, it\'s almost frightening. Wes was not on set, but gave his ideas and opinions to the animators and they brought it to life. Many kudos to them, who admitted, not being used to work like that before. Great voice artist help elevate the really very good, fine dialogue further.A movie for almost everyone.']
