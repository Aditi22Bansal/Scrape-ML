['I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved. This is a film that easily falls apart if you examine it carefully.However as a horror thriller, Krasinski makes it work to an extent. It is different and eerie with a lack of noise. The ending though is borrowed from Mars Attacks!']
