["While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"]
