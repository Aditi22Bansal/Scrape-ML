["If you are cynic, you might wanna steer clear of this. On the other hand, I like to be cynic here and there, and I still did quite enjoy this movie. It's not the best movie ever (far from it), but as a feel good movie, with a hint of danger here and there (and actually an upset that is almost ridiculous), it works very good. Performances are more than stellar too.I haven't seen all the movies that came out in 2009 in America to qualify for the best actress award, but I guess the theme of the movie, helped Sandra win this one. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty good in the movie. But it's the overall impact of the whole thing, that made her win (is my guess).While it might also be the TV movie of the week, the naturalistic approach by our main actor does upgrade it quite a bit. His down to earth character works really well ... unless you think real conflict is missing in the movie ..."]
