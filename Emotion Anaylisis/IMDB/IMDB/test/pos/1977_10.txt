['Erstwhile Ghostbuster Bill Murray battles the dead again, only this time it\'s zombies. Jim Jarmusch turns the genre on its head with "The Dead Don\'t Die", setting the movie up like a B movie (I particularly liked the investigation at the diner). They must\'ve had a lot of fun making this movie. An enjoyable one.']
