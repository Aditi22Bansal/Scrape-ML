["I liked this reworking of the Sleeping Beauty tale by Disney as they focus on Maleficent the malevolent fairy in Sleeping Beauty,Here Jolie's powerful fairy has been betrayed by a boyhood human friend and she curses the baby princess more out of anger and wanting revenge for the loss of her wings.However as the King for some reasons after the curse abandons the baby princess to three inept fairies its up to Maleficent to keep the baby safe from a distance which includes making sure she is fed.The screenplay and story is not without problems, in fact its heavily flawed and might perturb younger viewers. The parents give the child to the three fairies who are clueless in raising a baby and seem to be criminally negligent which ceases to be funny.The humans are shown to be power hungry out to destroy the fairy world with Sharlto Copley's King being an uneven villain himself. He betrays Maleficent for his desire for power and Copley's accent is a cross between South African, Nordic and Scots.Its a light film with great sets and costume design, a flawed fantasy with a strong performance from Angelina Jolie who lifts the film and makes it better than it has any right to be."]
