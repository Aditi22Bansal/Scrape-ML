['A bunch of horror tales that we see on VHS strung together by a bunch of hooligans breaking into a house to steal a VHS tape. First up is "Amateur Night" with a bunch of 20 something jerks going to a bar, getting two girls drunk and bringing them home to have sex. However one of the girls has a surprise for them. VERY bloody with female and male frontal nudity. Easily the best story in the movie. Next is "Second Honeymoon" about two people on a honeymoon being stalked...sort of. Slow and meandering but the ending was surprising. "Thursday the 17th" is obviously a homage to slasher films. A bunch of brainless college kids go into a forest and are killed off in various ways. The killings are gory and the ending unexpected. Next is "The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger". It\'s about a woman being haunted by a ghost. It has a few good moments but ended up being confusing with plenty of gratuitous female nudity. Easily the worst segment. Last up is "10/31/98" about a bunch of friends going to a Halloween party at an abandoned house...and getting more than they bargained for. It starts slow but REALLY works at the end. All in all a good horror anthology that scared me.']
