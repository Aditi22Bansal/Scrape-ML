['I\'m not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can\'t see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song "This is me" is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.Every song has its purpose (still of course you can question the why people would start just sing and dance as if they had choreographed it in advance - well they have, but you know what I mean) and it works. Be it the comedy numbers (Hugh and Zac in one instance in a bar just to name one example) or as dramatic pieces. Hugh has so much fun it transcends the screen ... if you are way worse with Musicals than me, maybe don\'t watch it .. otherwise give it a shot! But most definitely do listen to the song "This is me" ... phenomenal!']
