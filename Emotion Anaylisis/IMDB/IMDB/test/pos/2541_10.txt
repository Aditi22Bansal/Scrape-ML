['This film tells the story of an FBI agent who works with two swindlers to bring down a large and powerful corruption gang in the government."American Hustle" is very hyped as one of the best film of the year. With David O. Russell hot on the heels of his Oscar winner "Silver Linings Playbook", and the super stellar cast involved, one rightly has high expectations on it. The actors are charming in their roles, especially Amy Adams whose character is a smart woman who plays both sides of the game. Bradley Cooper\'s character is energetic and wild, and he is also an interesting character in the film. However, I find the plot rather uninteresting. It drags on too long, and there the events are not portrayed intense enough. And I was annoyed by Christian Bale\'s character\'s hair.Maybe my expectations are too high, but I thought "American Hustle" was just an alright film, and certainly over-hyped.']
