["Queen Elsa has a curse in that everything she touches turns to ice. Her sister Anna messes things up which leads to a roller coaster ride and a love story with a ton of Disney songs.I try to limit my Disney princess viewing. Since this film has become iconic in such a short period of time, and I have bought something from this film for every princess in my life, I had to watch it. I wasn't disappointed. Good fun."]
