["Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a poor bike courier in London. Under pressure from Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas), she decides to sign the papers declaring her missing father (Dominic West) dead and claim the family fortune. Before signing, she finds a clue which leads to her father's last quest to find Queen Himiko's tomb. She finds help from sea captain Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) and is captured by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who is using slave labor to dig for the tomb.This version of Croft intrigued me at first. Vikander is an interesting actress. The movie pulled me in by her losing that first fight. I was with her until I wasn't. Somewhere along the line, I got enough jumping to grab the edge of something or jumping to crash into something. It's a constant reminder that this is a video game movie and it won't stop. I kept thinking that I want a movie, not a video game pretending to be a movie. Eventually, I did lose interest but there is enough to recommend still."]
