["Initially, the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it, though, and get to know the characters, it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth, and a story about twins searching for their father, and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action, suspense, drama, and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war, and killings in the name of religion. What an absolutely fantastic script. This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in a while."]
