['I hate to say it, but the critic Ebert got it exactly right. This is not a very good "007" movie. Daniel Craig as James Bond is a good action hero, but 007 is not an action hero, he is the master of "cool". Ebert\'s review is a sort of call to restore the 007 themes to what we have come to expect, and I have to agree with him.Olga Kurylenko is the "Bond Girl" as Camille. (She reminded me very much of Catherine Zeta Jones in "Mask of Zorro", both in looks and in voice.) She is appropriately pretty and exotic, but there wasn\'t any real chemistry with 007.The evil one is Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene who is leading an illicit effort to corner the water supply in Bolivia, but when the movie was over neither my wife or I could explain what the story line was. There is lots of action, but it is hard to figure out why everyone is after everyone else.Unusual 007 movie.']
