["First off, I have to admit, that I haven't seen the original Charlie & the Chocolate movie. So I won't be able to compare the movies with each other. But I can tell you that this is a nice little kids movie, that you've got here. Johnny Depp, a Tim Burton regular, plays his role with much gusto.But the kids are great, too. Not to mention the squirrels or Charlie's helpers, who are also great. But it's all too neat and as an adult and/or as a frequent movie goer, you'll know where this is going. No surprise there, but still plenty of fun to be had, if you let the movie have an effect on you. Also noteworthy, Burtons wife is also in this movie, as in his other efforts, too and the really great Christopher Lee has a small, but significant role to play here too!"]
