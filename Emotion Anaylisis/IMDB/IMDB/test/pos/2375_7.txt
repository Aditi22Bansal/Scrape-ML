['it is the only word who can describe a great film like this. because, in its case, all is perfect. in so manner than it is strange to search the source of its bitter , fascinating beauty. Daniel Day-Lewis is the same from film to film. each nuance, each gesture, each word represent the example of high precision. Paul Dano could be a surprise but , in fact, he does only the role who expect you if you do not ignore his work before this film. scene by scene, the film is the splendid example of dark poetry. about ambition and about manner to use it. about demons and about victories price. about solitude. and, sure, about the essence of evil. a total show. a magnificent work.']
