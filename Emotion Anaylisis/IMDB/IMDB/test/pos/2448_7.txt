['Three hooligans are hired to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape. Once inside the first thing they see is the body of a dead man in the living room in front of several television screens. While two of them are searching the basement the other young man in the living room finds the tape in a VCR and plays it. He then watches several film segments of gruesome homicides which were recorded first-hand by the victim or perpetrator of these murders. Naturally, because these killings were taped by different people using their own individual video recorders the footage is extremely garbled and shaky. Obviously, this technique is done to give the appearance of a first-hand account of these killings similar in great measure to "The Blair Witch Project". However, the downside to this approach is that the overall quality of the movie typically suffers in the process. And so it is with this particular movie as well. Add in the fact that there was no coherent plot which managed to tie these unrelated murders together and the end result was something that made very little sense to me. Accordingly, I have to rate this movie as slightly below average.']
