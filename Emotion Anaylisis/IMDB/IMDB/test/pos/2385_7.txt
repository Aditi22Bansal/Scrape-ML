['In the 1800\'s, the clumsy teenager Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) crosses the wall in the border of his town to the magic realm of Stormhold to bring a fallen star to his beloved Victoria (Sienna Miller), a spoiled girl that does not love him but has promised to marry him if he accomplishes his promise. In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine (Claire Danes) and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King (Peter O\'Toole) of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone. Meanwhile, three evil witches led by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) seek Yvaine to eat her heart and make them young again, and the two sons of the dead king also search Ivaine because she wears the necklace with the powerful ruby."Stardust" is one of the most delightful movies that I have recently seen. The engaging story has fantasy, adventure, romance, comedy, a clumsy hero, a nice heroin and evil villains with a wonderful screenplay; awesome direction of the director of "Layer Cake"; stunning cast and magnificent special effects. "Stardust" is the type of pleasant film that deserves to be watched many times. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Stardust  O Mistério da Estrela" ("Stardust  The Mystery of the Star")']
