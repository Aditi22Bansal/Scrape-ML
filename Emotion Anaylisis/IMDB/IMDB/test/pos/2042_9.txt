['The film is a dark comedy and a generic spoof of family ritualistic satanic films. It opens with a wedding to Beethoven\'s 9th symphony D minor etc played during "Clockwork Orange" while Alex DeLong was being tortured by his own love for the music. Grace, a commoner (Samara Weaving) is going to wed Alex Le Domas whose family has "more money than God." They made their money from the manufacturing of games. At Midnight, they must play a game drawn from a card taken from an old box that they play or die. Grace was hoping for checkers.The title hints at the game and film poster of an armed bride who is dirty, tattered, and torn tells you what happens. The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can\'t shoot straight. Some of the players are apathetic about the game but play because they are told they must or die. The family consisted of a cast of characters that made the film fun.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
