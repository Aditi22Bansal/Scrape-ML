['Ben (Robert De Niro) is 70 and retired. He answers an ad for an Intern for a start up E-company that sells women\'s clothes. He says, "I still have music in me." He quickly becomes an asset to the company and founder Jules Austin (Anne Hathaway) in a film formula way.Yes, the light comedy is predictable. It is a good date night film and it does turn into a romance as I once heard "All the best pictures are romances." It is a feel good film that was well acted, directed, and written. One of the better of the plethora of films De Niro has done in the last few years And sometimes a feel good film is all we want.Guide: 3 F-bombs (one texted). No sex or nudity.']
