["This film is about the spontaneous holidays that 2 women arranged after being hurt by their respective love.Due to the nature of the film, it involves the romances of 2 couples. It is more like 2 parallel love stories in one film, which explains the length of this film. Fortunately, the transition between the two stories is smooth and clear. Cameron Diaz is excellent in her portrayal of her character. She can really act! Kate Winslet's expression of joy and surprise when she first arrived at her house in Los Angeles is memorable.The story is predictable, but it is entertaining anyway. The fact that Kate Winslet's character derived pleasure ans satisfaction through helping others contrasted with Cameron Diaz's character. This contrast s well done and well planned, as having 2 identical love stories would be boring."]
