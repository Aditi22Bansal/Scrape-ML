["In 1985 Moscow, CIA agent Lenny Miller (Cillian Murphy) loses nine operatives to KGB chief Vassiliev. Years later, Anna (Sasha Luss) is struggling in life and signs up for the Russian Navy. KGB agent Alex Tchenkov (Luke Evans) recruits her to be an assassin under the supervision of Olga (Helen Mirren).It's another hot assassin movie from Luc Besson. La femme Nikita is almost 30 years ago. He's like an old painter who keeps returning to the same style over and over again. He's trying something a little grittier and a little more real. It's not his lane. His lane is hot girl doing wild actions with simplistic story. He tries to add layers to the story. At last, he's no Graham Greene which brings to mind the acting skills of model-turned-actor Sasha Luss. She tries and the character is essentially her without the killings. She's surprisingly functional but she's no Meryl Streep. Finally, I would try to clean up the constant time-jumps in the plot. They are supposed to be shocking reveals but they mostly confuse and are unnecessary. If he does a straight forward timeline, the movie may actually gain some tension of wondering if anybody can be trusted. He's probably not capable of doing the truly gritty espionage movie. Somebody should do a film retrospective of his hot female assassin movies."]
