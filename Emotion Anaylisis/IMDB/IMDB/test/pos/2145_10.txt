['This film tells the story of the son of a tailor, who is determined to make it rich and famous, in order to be accepted by the high society.The story makes me tear up with joy many many times. The fact that it celebrates diversity makes it a heartwarming film. It values human beings just as they are, and gives off a strong and empowering message that you can still shine no matter what shape or size you are. The songs are upbeat and catchy, and the shows are beautiful to watch. I truly enjoyed, and was thoroughly touched by this musical.']
