['While neither me nor Mom remembered this very first James Bond movie much because of how long ago either of us had last seen this, we both remember some of the scenes. Mom noticed there wasn\'t much action compared to subsequent ones and I thought it was slow the first time I saw this. But it\'s still pretty exciting to watch and how awesome to see the first time that gun barrel animation that always begins the JB movies is first presented as well as the first time that theme plays, the first time Sean Connery says "Bond, James Bond", and the first time we also meet M and Miss Moneypenny! Add in Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, Joseph Wiseman as the first villain as referred to by the title, and Jack Lord (pre-original "Hawaii Five-O") as the first of several Felix Leiters and you\'ve got a treat of the initial entry in the James Bond series! So, yes, that\'s a recommendation.']
