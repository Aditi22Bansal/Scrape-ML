["I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before. It felt a bit like that to me, though that does not necessarily apply to any other viewer of course.Give it a chance on Disc, if you haven't already watched it."]
