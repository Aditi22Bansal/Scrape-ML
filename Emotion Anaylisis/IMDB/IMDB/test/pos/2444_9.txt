['An absolute joy to watch. One of the better animated features is an understatement. Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson)is a hotshot, outspoken rookie race car that lives for speed. He finishes in a three way tie with The King(Richard Petty)and Chick Hicks(Michael Keaton)for the chance to go on to the Piston Cup Championship race in California. On the way west, an unexpected detour finds Lightning in an almost forgotten town, Radiator Springs, on Route 66 off the interstate. McQueen makes true friendships with some quirky characters--including Mater(Larry the Cable Guy), Sally(Bonnie Hunt), Luigi(Tony Shalhoub)and Doc Hudson(Paul Newman), who happens to have won the Piston Cup several times in his faded career.Among other voices featured are: John Ratzenberger, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, Bob Costas and George Carlin. Helping rev up the action is a super soundtrack that features: Sheryl Crow, Rascal Flatts, James Taylor, John Mayer and Brad Paisley. You owe it to yourself to relax and be entertained. CARS is not to be missed.']
