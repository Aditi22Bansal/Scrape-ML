['A few years before Heath Ledger starred in "Brokeback Mountain", he played a man pretending to be a knight in "A Knight\'s Tale", chock full of deliberate anachronisms (namely the soundtrack). I swear that it was one of the funniest movies that year. I just gotta wonder: who comes up with these things? This movie is also interesting for an early appearance of Paul Bettany, who went on to play Russell Crowe\'s friends in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", and married Jennifer Connelly. All in all, this is one cool movie. It would be hard to imagine anyone not liking it. Hilarious. So I bid ye all to watch this film...\'twill not make ye bored one bit.']
