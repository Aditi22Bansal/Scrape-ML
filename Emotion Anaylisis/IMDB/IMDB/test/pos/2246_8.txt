['This film tells the story of a young man who is not physically fit enough to be in the Army. He is selected for a special program to transform him into a superhero that will save the United States of America."Captain America The First Avenger" is quite unlike other superhero blockbusters. It starts off slow, detailing how he was bullied on the streets of Brooklyn and then in the Army training base. He is finally transformed into a superhero after one hour of screen time, which is pretty long and slow if you ask me. Then, the plot is rather unfocused, as it tells the fight between USA and Nazi Germany, and also the fight between Rogers and the bad red guy. I find the plot so unfocused that I lost interest in it altogether. It is not packed with action enough, not packed with enough thrills or excitement. Though I am a little disappointed, I think I will still watch the sequel to see if it gets any better.']
