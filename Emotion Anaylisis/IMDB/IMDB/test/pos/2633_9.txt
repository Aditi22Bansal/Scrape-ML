['2012 is a science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich. It stars John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson, among others.Disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012. When a global cataclysm thrusts the world into chaos, divorced writer and father Jackson Curtis (Cusack) joins the race to ensure that humankind is not completely wiped out.He attempts to bring his children, Noah and Lilly , ex-wife Kate Curtis and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman to refuge and attempt to escape the heightened change in the elements. The movie provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.It is basically a total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-plus hours.']
