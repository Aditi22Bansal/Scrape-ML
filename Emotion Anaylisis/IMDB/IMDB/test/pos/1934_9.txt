["This is a film that has spawned a tv show and a musical, so it must have done something right.I watched this for the first time recently, having heard all the hype about it, and was pleasantly surprised.Yes, it follows the 'inspirational teacher film' structure, but puts something new on top of it, and features a good performance from Jack Black in the lead.Yes, it's unbelievable, yes, its ethics are questionable, but it's all good fun ultimately."]
