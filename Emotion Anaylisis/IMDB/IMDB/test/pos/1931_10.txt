["In what may be the worst marketing campaign of the year, and certainly close to the top 10 of the last decade, Charlie's Angels was likely never going to succeed the way Sony was hoping. Without a clearly beloved star across the board (Naomi Scott is a few years away from that) to center a campaign around, an unproven director, and an IP that had next to no buzz, what were they really expecting? The movie itself is perfectly okay. It's not a trainwreck but nor is it something worth seeing on the big screen. Maybe they would have been better off rebooting it with another TV series on a streaming service with a couple of big name actresses? A few cool action scenes and a neat post-credit montage helped, but it certainly doesn't save the doomed franchise. I would skip this one.4.8/10"]
