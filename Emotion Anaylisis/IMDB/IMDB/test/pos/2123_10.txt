["Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow. She's an artist trapped in a loveless marriage with her husband Hutton (Armie Hammer). Then she receives a book from her first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) that he wrote asking her to read it. She does and it brings back memories of her first marriage and what went wrong. We also see the book enacted out.Bleak, disturbing and depressing but fascinating. You see all three stories play out but it's never too difficult to follow. The tone is very dark and there's no humor to lessen it. It does end on an ambiguous note which can be seen a number of different ways. For the most part the acting is great. Hammer is terrible in his role but he's not really in the film enough to make a difference. Adams is great in her role but Gyllenhaal is incredible. He has two great characters to play and he does it to perfection. Twice he explodes and it's frightening to watch. A bleak but very powerful film. Recommended."]
