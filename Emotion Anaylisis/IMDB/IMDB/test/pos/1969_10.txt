["The Little Things is enjoyable to watch, and that's mostly due to the acting skills from the whole crew. Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and most certainly an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto did a great job playing their characters. There's also a good amount of suspense which keeps your attention. That said the ending isn't really a satisfying ending. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks that. There was clearly something missing in the last part and that's a pity because The Little Things could have been much better. Now it's just a good movie worth watching, but it's not exceptional like it could have been."]
