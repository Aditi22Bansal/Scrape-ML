['This is a super (if rather freely) adapted version of the Alcott story about a family of sisters as they come of age towards the end of the American Civil War. I suppose that I do, personally, prefer the 1949 version - it has a little more feistiness. In this iteration though, Saoirse Ronan is great as the independently minded author determined to go through life on her own terms; no mean feat at the time. Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are good too as her sisters/mother respectively (though the accents are a wee bit dodgy on occasion). Meryl Streep has some cracking one-liners and has her facial expressions perfected. The star for me, however, is Timoth√©e Chalamet - he plays the charming but emotionally fickle "Laurie" in a thoroughly captivating, engaging manner. The attention to detail is impressive and Alexandre Desplat\'s score helps the whole thing to come alive. It does sag in the middle; could perhaps do with shaving 15-20 minutes to tighten it up a little, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining watch.']
