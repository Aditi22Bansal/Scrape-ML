["After flirting with Disney with his live action remake of Aladdin.Posh Guy Ritchie is back on the mean streets of London with this lock stock and two smoking barrel gangster tale.In The Gentleman, Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam) is the right hand man of Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey.) The king of the weed jungle.Mickey wants out and is in negotiation with a shark Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) to sell his business. However a Chinese gangster wants to muscle in on the deal and finds the location of one of Mickey's manor where the weed is grown.Raymond is told a story one evening by private investigator Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who has been hired by a tabloid editor to investigate Mickey.Ritchie must have thought that if Quentin Tarantino can go back to the same well, so can he. Ritchie even throws in a homage to The Long Good Friday but without a Pierce Brosnan cameo.It really is a simple story jumbled up with an unreliable narrator. Nothing in it is much of a surprise apart from the casual racism."]
