["Initially I thought I was in for a horror movie without the scares. How many zombie movies start of in the same way, Ill person on train collapses, carnage follows, however, consider a film that substitutes the carnage for reasoned plot. In some ways Contagion felt like it could have been made as a TV drama, the threat is very, very realistic, as you watch you find yourself thinking this could really happen. Immediately after watching I bought a hand sanitizer and checked for bats :-) Surprising parts for Damon and Paltrow, but each perform very well. Overall it was more contained then I expected, that in itself makes it scary, that safe feeling you get knowing blood thirsty monsters are on the other side isn't here, instead are a series of events that cause real unease. A good watch."]
