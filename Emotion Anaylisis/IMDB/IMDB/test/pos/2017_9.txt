["Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them\nwell makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American\nCivil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the\nsuperpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than\ncould have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason\nthese films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many\nheroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical\nsuccessor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.\nSomething like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats\none challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.\nBoseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,\nbut it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they\nare, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."]
