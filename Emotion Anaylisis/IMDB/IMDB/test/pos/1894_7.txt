["Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police. He bought her a truck from Billy Black and befriends Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) but he goes to school in the reservation. She makes a few new friends but is more intrigue by the Cullens especially Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward can't seem to stand her at first. Then he saves her with his supernatural powers. There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson. They are good actors and it's not that bad as far as overwrought teen melodrama is concerned. They are teenage star-crossed lovers and there's no shame in that."]
