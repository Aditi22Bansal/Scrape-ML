["'The Internship' is Good Fun! An entertaining, feel-good film, that doesn't tax your brain. Its a smooth watch!'The Internship' Synopsis: Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment.'The Internship' has a few clichéd moments, but other-wise, this recent comedy, doesn't have any massive flaw going against it. Its interesting to see its aging protagonists having fun & emerging victorious against the youngsters. The characters work & so does the narrative.Vince Vaughn & Jared Stern's Screenplay surrenders to clichés at times, but is well-done otherwise. Shawn Levy's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing, are average. Performance-Wise: Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson are very good. Also, they share a wonderful chemistry on-screen, just like they did years back in Wedding Crashers. Max Minghella is convincing in a menacing part. Rose Byrne looks gorgeous & delivers a restrained performance. Aasif Mandvi is impressive. John Goodman & Will Ferrell are terrific in cameos. On the whole, 'The Internship' works."]
