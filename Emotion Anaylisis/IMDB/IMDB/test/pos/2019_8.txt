['Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a non-popular nerd in his high-school, having just two friends, Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano), and concerned with the situation of a Cambojean student and in getting a scholarship to Georgetown. When the sexy Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) comes to live in the next door, they date and fall in love for each other. Later, Matthew finds that Danielle was a porn star, but when her former boyfriend and producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) visits her and invites her to return to the porn industry, the situation gets out of hand of Matthews and he gets into serious trouble."The Girl Next Door" is a very sexy and funny comedy, and the confusions that Matthew gets into are hilarious. There are many elements of "Risky Business" in this movie, and the greatest modification is that Danielle is not a prostitute like Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), and I believe the writer got inspiration in that 1983 comedy to write this story. Elisha Cuthbert is extremely sexy and perfect for the role of Danielle, and Emile Hirsch fits very well for his character. However, Timothy Olyphant "steals all the scenes" as Kelly. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Show de Vizinha" ("Show of Neighbor")']
