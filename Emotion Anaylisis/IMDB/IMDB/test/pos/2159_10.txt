['"Saw" is the sort of movie which you would expect to be completely gross, but it manages to have a plot. Two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), wake up chained to pipes in a putrid bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They come to realize that, although there are saws which they can use to cut the pipes, they are not supposed to do that. As the movie progresses, we learn more and more about secrets that both men have, some of which relate to the perpetrator of this ugly situation.The movie is gruesome all the way through, but rarely disgusting. You should not watch this movie if you have a weak stomach.I would never have guessed that Danny Glover could do horror (he plays a detective investigating the case), but he does a really good job here.']
