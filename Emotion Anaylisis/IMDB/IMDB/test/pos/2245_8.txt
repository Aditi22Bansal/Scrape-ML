["I will say up front I know nothing about Captain America, nothing about Marvel Comics, and I'm not a connoisseur of special effects.That all being said, Captain America was highly entertaining.Chris Evans is the scrawny Steve Rogers, who, after trying without fail to get into World War II, is chosen by a scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) for an experiment called Project Rebirth. Steve is transformed into the superhuman to create the all-powerful man, who becomes Captain America. Dr. Erskine is assassinated by a HYDRA agent - HYDRA being the Nazi secret research.Initially Rogers is misused, sent out to sell war bonds. However, he abandons this when his good friend Bucky and his unit are caught behind enemy lines. Then he finally gets into the war as he has always wanted.Great cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough, and Samuel L. Jackson.I really liked the effects, although I gather some people thought they weren't that good. What I liked the most was the old-fashioned ambiance, which was very well done.Enjoyable."]
