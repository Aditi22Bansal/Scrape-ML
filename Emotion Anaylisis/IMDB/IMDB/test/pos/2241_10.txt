['This film tells the story of a teenage girl who isn\'t as beautiful as her best friends. She is called a designated ugly fat friend, and her quest to change herself is started.I love high school movies, because they are always fun to watch. In "The DUFF", the plot is predictable but is very funny. I laughed out loud so many times, especially the scene where Bianca goes on a date with Toby. The scene outside the library about unfriending each other us hilarious as well, but i cab totally see it happening in real life. The positive message within the film is prominent and infectious, and it makes me feel more positive and happy! I really enjoyed watching this film.']
