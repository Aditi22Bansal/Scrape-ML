['What a pure masterpiece here. A terrific, outstanding movie, so powerful. A head hit in the face, I can\'t explain better. All away from clich√©s, a billion miles from everything you have already seen about the subject, with the usual scheme of the good American authorities fighting against the evil cartels. Nothing of that here. It\'s not good vs evil scheme, but evil vs "eviler". That\'s all. Period. Benicio Del Torro will forever be for drug cartel films what John Wayne was for westerns. And Del Torro\'s character\'s name in this feature is Medellin.... One more thing. This settings could have been Afghanistan or Irak where Special Forces would have to fight against Muslims terrorists. But instead of that, this movie takes place in Mexico, near the US border, and the fight in question against drug cartels instead. The kind of action film, busted with testosterone, that won\'t be forgotten, and also which makes you think long after the viewing. A pure true masterpiece.']
