["Just by the title I was expecting a horror movie, but it's a crime/drama, even though you could concider it as a horror since it's very religious and what is more horrorful than religion? The Devil All The Time is a quite long movie but it doesn't feel like that because there are multiple stories that in a way are all connected to each other and they are all very captivating to watch. The cast is excellent, with a lot of good actors like Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Bill Skarsg√•rd, Eliza Scanlen etc. Robert Pattinson, once an actor I didn't really appreciate (probably because of those dumb Twilight series) is a totally different actor now that did a very good job playing his character. This movie has different stories and they're all very religion themed, what makes it interesting to watch. As an atheist I always find it fascinating to watch very religious people believing the most idiotic things and in The Devil All The Time you get a lot of those scenes, if not all of them. There's a fair amount of murdering so it's more a crime than a drama and that's what makes this movie worth watching."]
