['The film opens with a loving nurturing Dracula caring for his daughter in 1895. In order to protect her from evil humans he constructs a huge castle as a refuge for monsters which include, Frankenstein, wolfman, invisible man, bigfoot, zombies, ghouls, Quasimodo etc. We then move to the present as his teen looking daughter turns 118 and wants to see the world. Before the first human shows up we already know the script.There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome. Dracula constantly denies saying "blah, ba-blah, ba-blah." There is one scene the kids laughed at and that was when someone pulled down the swimming trunks of the Invisible Man. He quickly pulls them back up, tells people "I just got out of the pool! It\'s cold! Don\'t judge me!" At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, "I\'m not very good at."At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they "came out." I\'m sure there was some kind of message there.As an adult, I was basically bored with the film which had such great potential. 4 stars from a kids view. Not really scary or funny.']
