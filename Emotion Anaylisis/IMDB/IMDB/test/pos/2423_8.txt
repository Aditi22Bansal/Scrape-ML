["A psychological thriller from director James Wan. According to Merriam-Webster...Insidious:treacherous; having a collective effect. Josh Lambert(Patrick Wilson)moves his family into a brand new home and immediately Josh and his wife Renai(Rose Byrne)hear strange noises in the middle of the night. The next day their son Dalton(Ty Simpkins) informs his mother that he doesn't like his new room; actually afraid of whats in his room. Even Dalton's brother is afraid of the footsteps he hears in the night. Dalton becomes sick and falls into a mysterious coma. The doctors can't explain the coma or the other hospital tests. The boy is taken home where his body begins to attract a malevolent force. When the Lamberts begin to realize there is a real threat, they move to another home hoping to leave the convincing evil spirit behind. Well, that's when their problems really get serious. Cinematography is super; wish I could say the same for the last third of the movie. The Lamberts must give in to the supernatural to awaken their son from his coma. I just can't get into Wilson or his character. Byrne is no better. Others in the cast: Angus Sampson, John Henry Binder, Ruben Pla and Barbara Hershey."]
