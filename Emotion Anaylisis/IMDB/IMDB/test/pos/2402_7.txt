['40-somethings Billy and Nick are brilliant salesmen, but that counts for nothing when their employer shuts down. Needing to find what to do next, they try out for the intern program at Google, where they end up applying their life skills and experiences as part of a team of misfits.My experience has been that both Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson are lazy actors - they play the same parts and give the same performances in every film, and The Internship does not overturn that formula. However, they also have an easy and likable chemistry as we saw in the Wedding Crashers, and this works well for them here. This is a gentle, likable comedy, where most of the characters are pleasant company, the chuckles are frequent and the smiles constant, the moral statements worth making and fairly subtly delivered, and the romance (Wilson and Rose Byrne) nicely played.By no means a classic, neither is it in any way offensive (apart from a single unwelcome F-bomb). I positively enjoyed it.']
