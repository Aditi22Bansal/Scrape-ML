['This film is about Harry Potter\'s sixth year at Hogwart\'s School for wizards."Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" excels in visual effects. The various wizardry phenomena, such as the various Weasley\'s shop are visual delights. The pensieve and the process of memory retrieval are the most impressive.The plot concentrates on romance and jealousy, with little wizard battles or action. The plot as it is still could have been entertaining, but the delivery of it suspense or thrill. Even the final climax that evoked outcry from Harry Potter fans around the world seems plain and dry. That scene certainly could have been more thrilling and exciting.That being said, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" is still adequate entertainment. I did not feel the film lasted for 2.5 hours at all, and I was actually surprised when the film ended, as I was expecting more.']
