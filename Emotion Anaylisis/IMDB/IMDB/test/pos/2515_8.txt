["Kainan (Jim Caviezel) is an alien who crash lands on Earth bringing with him an animal called Moorwen of immense power. He must convince the local Vikings led by King Hrothgar (John Hurt) to join him to battle the creature. Love interest is played by Sophia Myles.There is some good action, and a good premise for sci-fi historical drama. It starts off relatively well. There is good action and good drama. The monster is revealed a little too early. They could have saved it for some place more powerful.Then there is the middle where the tension is almost all drained away. Kainan knows the creature is still out there, but he barely protests as the Vikings parties. It makes little sense. And Jim Caviezel isn't able to maintain any suspense there. It reveals one thing during the feast, but it's hardly worth the time wasted. I rather have more hunting action.The final hunt is a little muddled and too extended. After the big battle, it feels too repetitive. It seems anti-climatic to have the best action happen so much earlier. And the final blow isn't quite so great. I would have expected something more head chopping."]
