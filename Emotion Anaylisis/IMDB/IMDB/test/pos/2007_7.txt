["1980's Lombardia, in a summer in which there is no rain, where everything is just high philosophy, swimming in lakes and reading in the sun on an Italian mansion, two people fall in love. The acting is good, the script is subtle, the love story is expressed very well, the scenery is amazing. It's just that there is no story other than the romance. Everything is perfect, including the ending. A perfect summer romance with no ups or downs, no extra context, just love. My wife loved the film, I was trying very hard not to fall asleep.Bottom line: You probably have to be in the mood to enjoy the film. I didn't think the gay angle was significant in any way. Had it been between a man and a woman, I would have felt similarly bored."]
