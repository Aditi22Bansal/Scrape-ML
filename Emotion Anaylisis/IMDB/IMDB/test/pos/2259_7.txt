['This film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time. He embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriend.Though the main character is a guy, it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women. The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It\'s almost like "The Notebook" plus "The Time Traveler\'s Wife" combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there\'s much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don\'t make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it\'s a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn\'t the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it\'s still an enjoyable film.']
