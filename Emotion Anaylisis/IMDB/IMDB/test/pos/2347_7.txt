['When the ambitious King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas\'s army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.The epic "The 300 Spartans" is a great tale of courage, heroism and idealism. This remake is more cartoonist and violent, with monsters and giants as if it were a video game. The Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro is unrecognizable in the role of the King Xerxes. I usually do not like remakes, but this one gives a different approach to the heroic King Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans that defended their country in 480 BC. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "300"']
