["This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!"]
