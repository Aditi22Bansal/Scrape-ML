['Jake Gyllenhaal has played a number of good roles over the past two decades, and he continues this streak with "Nightcrawler". He plays a man who decides to make a career filming sensationalistic events and selling the footage to a local TV station. It\'s hard to determine which party is more amoral: the man shooting the footage to further his own career, or the TV station more interested in attracting viewers than performing serious journalism. Either way, Gyllenhaal\'s character is a truly scary individual. His blank stare hides sociopathic tendencies.One could interpret the movie as a cynical look at the media, or as a cynical look at our society\'s obsession with sensational stories. After all, aren\'t the media simply giving people what they want? Whatever the case, "Nightcrawler" is a good movie. It gives LA the same seedy look that the average film noir used to show.']
