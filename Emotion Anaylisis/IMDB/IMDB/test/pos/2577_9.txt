["It's 1973 in a Pennsylvania suburb. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is 14 years old living with her parents Jack (Mark Wahlberg), Abigail (Rachel Weisz), younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and brother. She likes Ray Singh who slips a note into her book. As she walks home through the cornfield, she encounters her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) who takes her into his underground hiding place. She escapes but eventually figures out that she's actually been murdered. School outcast Ruth lives by a sinkhole. That night, she sees Susie's spirit and finds Ray's note. Detective Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) investigates the disappearance and then her murder. Suspicions fall on Harvey but there isn't enough evidence. Holly is another Harvey victim who urges Susie to move on. The Salmon family struggles and Jack asks his hard-drinking mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) to stay with them.The movie suffers from a mishmash of different tones. The serial killing is dark and horrific. Then there is the magical otherworld which needs to be much more creepy. It's too magical and not enough tension. Saoirse Ronan is terrific who keeps the movie upright. I don't even know what Sarandon is doing in the movie. This movie is trying to slam together a teen girl romanticism and a serial killer horror movie. The mashup doesn't really work but it is an interesting attempt."]
