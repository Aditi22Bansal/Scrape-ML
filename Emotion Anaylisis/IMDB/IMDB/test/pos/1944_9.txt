['The story line, I suppose fictitious, is a scientist claimed that humans are born with a blood alcohol level "too low." (I suppose it is zero.) And that humans can perform much better with a small amount of alcohol constantly present in their systems, about 0.05%. (Of note many US states have legal limits of 0.08% so 0.05% is actually pretty high.)So four friends, all teachers at the local Denmark high school, decide to formally test the premise, in secret of course. Some of them see positive benefits, and especially in the vigor with which they teach the students. But things start to seriously go off the rails when they decide, if a little helps then maybe a lot will help even more. But they also find out being in a drunken stupor isn\'t the answer either. And the head of the school finds out and isn\'t pleased.Interesting movie, even in Danish with English subtitles. There are some humorous moments but it is a serious story, well worth a watch. At home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped, doesn\'t like subtitles.Interestingly I hear an American remake is in the works.']
