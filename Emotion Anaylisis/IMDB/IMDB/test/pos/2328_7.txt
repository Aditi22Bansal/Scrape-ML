['This is the first horror film I\'ve seen for ages that actually sent the occasional shiver down my spine. I\'m not quite sure why it\'s been re-released onto the big screen late in 2020, but I\'m glad I made the effort. Ethan Hawke ("Ellison Oswalt") made his name ten years earlier as an author who wrote a book "Kentucky Blood" which dealt with the murder of an entire family and uncovered evidence overlooked by the police - much to their chagrin! Ever since, though, he has never managed to replicate his success and so now, together with wife "Tracy" (Juliet Rylance) and their two kids, takes up residence in a bungalow that was previously owned by a family found hanged from the bough of a tree in their own garden. Now, I don\'t know about you - but that would probably have been my cue to skedaddle, but he perseveres and when he discovers some really intriguing home movies in the attic, then starts hearing things go bump in the night the mystery deepens as does his dependence on the whisky bottle. Scott Derrickson uses light and sound eerily well and manages to create a genuine and ascending sense of peril here; Hawke is on form and as we gradually see the pattern emerging - with the help of the seemingly dozy, but actually pretty savvy local deputy James Ransone - the film gathers quite a decent pace to it. I liked the ending too...']
