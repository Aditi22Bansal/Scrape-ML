["I haven't watched this movie for such a long time because I am no fan of dramatic teen movies but it ended up being a pleasant surprise.The movie is 2h 22min long but it doesn't feel long. It is well paced and things keep on happening while the viewer keeps on being interested in what happens next.I liked how they made us like several character which made us wonder more what will happen at the end since only one can win. One group is made like really bad guys, maybe it would have been too much to make them all get empathy from viewer but I would have preferred it this way. They had reason to kill each other anyways.In some cases it is even surprising how often they spare her life or how she can nap without being attacked all the time. I just kept telling myself that characters are teenagers, they sometimes lack logic.And based on the title I assumed they will be hungry. Fight for food as well. There was nothing of it. It seemed like it took them 2-3 days for all those games and all that time they were well fed.The acting and characters are really good. Was great to see Wes Bentley in his character. I am sad he won't be in the next one. It is not a big part but he was just awesome in it."]
