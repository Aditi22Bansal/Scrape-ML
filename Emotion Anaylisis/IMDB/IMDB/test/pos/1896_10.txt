["Based on Stephanie Meyer's enormously popular best selling sensation; a story of love at first stare. A sullen Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart)moves from Phoenix to a small wooded town in Washington state. Worlds and hearts collide when Bella meets a mysteriously handsome Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson). He is putty paste white complete with eye-liner and lipstick. He is either a rock star, very effeminate...or a...vampire. Yes, he is of the undead persuasion and never sleeps. Bella is willing to give up everything to be with him forever...with limits that is. Edward and his family must protect and guard Bella from a totally different group of blood suckers.Interesting special effects. Beautiful Washington and Oregon scenery. Dialoge pretty lame; but the story line definitely sustains attention. Stewart is quite charming even being mostly emotionless. Others in the cast: Peter Facinelli, Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone and Cam Gigandet. I can't say it lives up to all the hype."]
