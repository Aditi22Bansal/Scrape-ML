['After witnessing the death of his father in an aircraft accident "Hal Jordan" (Ryan Reynolds) grows up trying to be as fearless as he presumes his father was. This leads him to test his limits and accept risks that most normal people would not attempt. Then one day an alien from another galaxy crashes his spaceship and upon realizing that he his death is imminent allows the essence within a powerful ring in his possession to seek out a worthy recipient who has the courage to face his fears. Needless to say, the essence immediately finds Hal and brings him to the alien who proceeds to give him the ring and some final last words before dying. And so begins the life and adventure of another member of the Green Lantern Corps. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been an excellent superhero film if it had a more serious or coherent plot. Unfortunately, the director "Martin Campbell" apparently couldn\'t focus on what kind of movie he wanted and the result was one which had some rather bad CGI along with some heroes and villains who belonged more to a children\'s matin√©e than a prime-time movie. In other words, it lacked the necessary intensity. Yet despite some of the negatives, it wasn\'t necessarily a total disaster as it still remained fairly interesting and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.']
