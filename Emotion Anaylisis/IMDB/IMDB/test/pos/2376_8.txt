["Plenty of suspense and anxiety to keep you wiggling in your seat. Kudos to Jaume Collet-Serra's direction of David Johnson's gritty screenplay. Wishes of a home sweet home go to the wayside, when Kate Coleman(Vera Farmigo)and husband John(Peter Sarsgaard), who recently lost a baby due to miscarriage, decide to adopt. Ready or not the couple visit an orphanage, where they meet Esther(Isabelle Fuhrman), a dark haired, dark eyed mature nine-year-old. The adoption seems to be a fresh start for all; except for the other two Coleman children. Not long after bringing Esther home, a series of accidents at home and school lead Kate to believing that her new daughter is not as innocent as she seems. John doesn't see the young girl's wicked side and loses confidence in his wife. No one really knows the truth about Esther's past...until it is almost too damn late.The snowy winter weather and demure creepy music blend into the anxious atmosphere. You can feel the simmering fear and the few scenes of real violence are definitely graphic. Miss Fuhram is an outstanding young actress. In this role she is mesmerizing. She appears to have the tools already for a very interesting career. Also in the cast: CCH Pounder, Jimmy Bennett and an impressive young Aryana Engineer. To me, ORPHAN has what you go to the movies for. Yes, some images are disturbing and the language is coarse; but still I recommended highly."]
