["After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more. All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film."]
