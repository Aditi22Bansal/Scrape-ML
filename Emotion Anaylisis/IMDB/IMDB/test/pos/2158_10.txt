['Directed by James Wan who also directed a little horror flick STYGIAN in 2000. Wan collaborates with one of the stars Leigh Wannell in the screenplay. SAW is a grisly nightmare of a movie. Adam(Wannell)finds himself waking up in a seedy abandoned building basement with his leg chained to a huge pipe. Across the room is a young doctor Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes)also chained by the leg. In between them is the corpse of a gunshot victim holding a tape recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket explaining what is expected of them...mainly Dr. Gordon gets to live if he kills off Adam within a fixed amount of time. Each man has access to a hack saw...just in case they want to free themselves by cutting off their foot. Detective David Tapp(Danny Glover)has a personal reason to be obsessed with finding the thrill killer responsible for this horrid situational game. This atmospheric chiller deserves the chance to disturb you. Also in the cast are: Shawnee Smith and Dina Meyer.']
