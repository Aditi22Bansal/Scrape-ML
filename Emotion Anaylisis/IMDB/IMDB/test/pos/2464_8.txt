["Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing."]
