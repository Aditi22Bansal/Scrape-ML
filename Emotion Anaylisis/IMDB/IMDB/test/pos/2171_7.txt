["I thought this was bags of fun, who said that satire was a thing of the past, Jojo Rabbit prices that it is alive and well..It's one of those films that will have you laughing one minute, crying the next, then awkwardly chuckling in the scene after that.It's very well acted, very well made, the production values are actually very, very strong.I saw this on its release with a few friends, it was my choice, faces were pulled at the thought of it, but everyone enjoyed, one quibbled before the film that she thought it was going to be offensive, it isn't, it's all tongue in cheek.I look forward to seeing it again, I recommend. 8/10."]
