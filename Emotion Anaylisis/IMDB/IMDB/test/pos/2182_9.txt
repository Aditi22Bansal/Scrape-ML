['A young girl is on vacation with her parents when she decides to go to town to hang out with a friend. It\'s there where she and her friend decide to go get high with a complete stranger. It is at that point that the lives of these two teenagers is flipped upside down.The first thought that may have entered your mind is probably somewhere along the lines of: "Don\'t you know better?" But of course, they were in a small town and the guy seemed so innocent... which he was; it was just his dad, dad\'s girlfriend and his uncle that were ape nuts.This movie was more about the toughness and tenacity of a teen and the resourcefulness and fight of a couple of regular parents than anything else. From the character development you gather that the girl and her family are the epitome of normal while the criminals in this movie are the epitome of psychotic. Without a doubt you find yourself wishing for the demise of the bad guys while hoping for the triumph of the captives. Of course, there are the "Oh My God, why did you do that?" moments that are customary for any thriller/horror flick.There have been better movies from this genre; either better stories, or more affable characters, or gorier, or more sinister, etc. but this movie holds its own.']
