["It's eight months after the Blip, the moment when the people who got dusted in the Snap return after over five years. It's a period of readjustment as those people come to terms with the world five years later. Tony Stark is gone and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to fill some very large shoes. He and his friend Ned Leeds are set to go on an European school trip. Peter is struggling to make his move with MJ (Zendaya). In Venice, they are attacked by a water monster and they are saved by fish bowl head Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) who claims to be Quentin Beck from another Earth.It would have been great to have Gyllenhaal be Holland's replacement mentor. I don't mind the expected villain turn although he probably has a few too many henchmen. As for Zendaya's MJ, her deadpan delivery holds some interest but could be limiting in future sequels. The main question I have is whether this franchise needed an European Vacation already. Most of time, a franchise should be stale before trying to refresh itself with exotic locations. I wouldn't mind more high school and more Aunt May to let his world breathe. The reason for a younger Peter Parker actor is for him to live more fully in the high school experience. At this pace, he's getting a job at the newspaper in the next movie and that would be a shame. He should be having more high school soap opera before then."]
