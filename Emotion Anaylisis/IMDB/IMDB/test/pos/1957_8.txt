["After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale."]
