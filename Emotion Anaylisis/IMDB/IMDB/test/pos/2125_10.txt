['This film tells the story of a wealthy art gallery owner, whose marriage is falling apart as her husband is having an affair. She relives memories of her life with her ex-husband, when her ex-husband sends her a copy of a manuscript of a violent story he has written."Nocturnal Animals" has a powerful story line because of the subject matter that is detailed in the violent manuscript. This plot within the plot is very powerful, and is very engagingly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon. The survivor guilt, grief and anger are all effectively portrayed. It is sad that the system could not do much about the perpetrator of such horrible crimes, which makes viewers feel even more for Tony Hastings. As for the art gallery owner subplot, it is told in a subtler manner. We can see her grieving too, but in a different way compared to Tony Hastings. Her subplot is unresolved, as opposed to to the manuscript subplot.I was quite surprised to see that this film is directed by Tom Ford. This is such a different film compared to his last film "A Single Man\'. It would be interesting to see what he will direct next.']
