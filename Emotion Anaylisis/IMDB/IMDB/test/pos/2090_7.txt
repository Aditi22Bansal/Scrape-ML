['This is not flashy or shiny and it may not really cover your need for grandness. Just because this is slow burning, does not make it bad, but it may make it an experience some viewers will not like. It\'s about taste, what you like in a movie and what you expect from it. If you take the acting, the way this is assembled, the symbolic meanings, the soundtrack, the dialog, the structure ... it is almost flawless. And I say almost because there is always something you can detect that you may feel (or is) flawed.You may know or kind of get where this is going, but it doesn\'t take away the fun one can have with it. As I mentioned above this has all the right ingredients and has some "wow" moments too. It does not shy away from depicting or showing the violence and it has social messages. Whether you see them or not is another thing - or even care for them. Wicked idea and really good interpretation of it']
