["Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is tired of her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns) and leaves her LA life for a few weeks. They use a vacation website to chat up a home exchange. During their vacation, they each fall for their own local guys.It's a double rom-com. Jack Black is trying to be a romantic lead. He and Winslet make an odd couple. She's absolutely charming. He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours. It's kinda corny and kinda formulaic, but it has its heart in the right place."]
