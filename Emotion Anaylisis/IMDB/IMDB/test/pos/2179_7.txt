["Edgar Wright directs and writes this action-packed crime drama about a young getaway driver named Baby (Ansel Elgort). Angel-faced Baby is hired as a driver for a series of bank heists by crime boss, Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby doesn't say much, but his high octane motivation is choreographed to his personal soundtrack, he constantly listens to. He meets a pretty young waitress named Debora (Lily James), that is the girl of his dreams. A botched robbery sends him on the run and he is hunted by the cops and his criminal boss and cohorts.Plenty of car chases with demolishing accidents; mass shootings, with machine-gun carnage all set to the beat of Baby's soundtrack that features tunes by the likes of Sam & Dave, R.E.M., Focus, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Barbara Lewis, The Commodores, Queen, T. Rex and Carla Thomas.The cast also features: Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm, CJ Jones and Jon Bernthal. I was most impressed with Miss James. Rated R for obvious reasons. See it once and you'll want to see it again!"]
