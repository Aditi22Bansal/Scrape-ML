["The title sequence to this movie was one of the best that I have seen in years. It was fascinating and creative and it alone makes the entire movie worthwhile.The concept is also believable. I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened. Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge, we could see something like this for real. We may not, but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting, too.Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own. He gave an outstanding performance, and I want to see more of him. Vinessa Shaw, Dan Byrd, and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable. hey, they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine)."]
