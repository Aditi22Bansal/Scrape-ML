["A total blast to me and my sister! Beautiful cast, cinematography and great soundtrack. A lot more action than I was expecting but great fight sequences none the less. I'd say Kristen Stewart was the best thing about the movie, I like Naomi Scott too she's precious. I'm not sure whats going on with the ratings/reviews on this adaptation regardless I absolutely loved Charlies's Angels especially for it's women power and mindless fun!"]
