['The film opens in London 1970 with Freddy working at Heathrow. In two hours it touches on the main aspects of his life, including his bisexuality and love for Mary (Lucy Boynton). The film concludes with the Live Aid concert where Rami Malek does a horrible lip sync. Rami Malek reminded me more of Mick Jagger than Freddie Mercury. In spite of my criticism, it would be difficult to find someone else more fitting for a difficult role who manages to break down the complexity. I was glued to the screen for the entire showing...singing along.Guide: 1 F-word. British swear words. No sex or nudity.']
