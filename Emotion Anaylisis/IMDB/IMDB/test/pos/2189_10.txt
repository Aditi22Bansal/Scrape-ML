['Not too hard to realize that for half a century, we have shared ups and downs, and survived crisis after crisis with Agent 007. This is the 23 James Bond installment and third starring Daniel Craig, as that beloved cool and captivating super spy. Say too much, say too little; SKYFALL has a different feel for some reason. Everyone can find their own reason for dissing and hissing at this one. Bond is vulnerable and yet dynamic and again the man you can depend on. M16 comes under attack and so does the credibility of M(Judi Dench), as she must relocate the agency. Her past creeps in to haunt her and this new dilemma has her putting her only hope in 007 to uncover its origins. Bond will have the aid of agency field agent Eve(Naomi Harris)to challenge a new Chairman of Intelligence(Ralph Fiennes)and follow a treacherous trail of a mysterious madman(Javier Bardem). Explosion after explosion is typical, but having M playing a more active role is not. Somehow of course, the old saying proves true...there IS a reason for everything. I really found the use of "Boom Boom" by The Animals fitting. And you can\'t ignore the wonderful theme by Adele, that I feel will be memorable for a long time. Also in the cast: Rory Kinnear, Bill Buckhurst, Ben Whishaw, Berenice Marlohe and Ian Bonar.']
