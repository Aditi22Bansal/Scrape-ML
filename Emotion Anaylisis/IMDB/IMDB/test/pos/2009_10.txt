["CALL ME BY YOUR NAME (2017) **** Armie Hammer, Timothee Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Esther Garrel, Victoire Du Bois, Vanda Capriolo. Wonderful coming of age romantic dramedy set in Northern Italy circa 1983 with teen Chalamet (a superb performance) bonding with and eventually falling for Hammer (equally good), his father's research assistant. Based on Andre Aciman's novel, James Ivory's adaptation is wistful, very funny and deeply poignant in the depiction of losing one's virginity, learning who they are and accepting the challenges ahead. One of the year's best with lovely cinematography by Syaombhu Mukdeprom, Simon and Garfunkelian songs by Sufjan Stevens and beguiling direction by Luca Guadagnino."]
