["One thing that remains constant in this action packed thriller. Denzel Washington's mysterious former life remains just that throughout the movie. What organization did he work for? Who were these two people from the group that we briefly see.Settling down to a quiet life following his wife's passing, that is all upset when he meets a Russian girl, most likely a hooker, who is being harassed by her Russian gangster mates.The rest of the film is devoted to Denzel assuming a Rambo role and killing the first group, which sends others after him. All we then see are violent, horrible ways that Denzel kills his prey."]
