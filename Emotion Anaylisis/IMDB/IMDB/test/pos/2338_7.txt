['This film tells the true story of a bunch of people who saw what no one else in Wall Street saw. They trade accordingly, betting against the American economy. However, their profits come at a very high price to the American public."The Big Short" has three separate story lines, as three different groups of people bet against the banks. I find that slightly confusing at first, and that is not helped by the complicated financial jargon. Fortunately, they do explain the jargon well, using entertaining dialogs by cameo actresses. The three separate story lines make the film very realistic, but I find it less engaging and captivating than other financial crisis films. However, it is one of the few financial crisis films that touch on the disastrous impact on the public, which is a nice touch.']
