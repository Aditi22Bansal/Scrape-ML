["DON'T BREATHE (2016) ***1/2 Stephen Lang, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Emma Bercovici, Franciska Torocsik, Christian Zagia, Katia Bokor, Jane May Graves. Unnerving thriller about a trio of friends whose home invasion/robbing spree comes to a halt when they pick on the wrong dupe, a blind Gulf War veteran grieving for the recent loss of his daughter (Lang pitch perfect and creepy as hell) who proves to be a lethal force to be reckoned with. Suspenseful and taut as a trip-wire filmmaker Fred Alvarez - who co-scripted the equally nerve-jangling script by partner-in-crime Rodo Sayagues - pulls out all the stops employing a deftly edited sound effects score by Joshua Adeniji and gooseflesh cinematography by Pedro Luque. Levy and Minnette shine as the closer two of the three criminals by balancing the tricky beam of begin innocent and guilty in their actions. Hang on."]
