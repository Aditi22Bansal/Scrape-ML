["I've previously been critical of Halloween follow ups, and some of Rob Zombie's films, but this, I thought excellent.The original is one of my favourite films, certainly my favourite horror film, it was a game changer. I had always shuddered at the thought of it being remade, but this, nowhere near the quality of the original, but it's a cracking movie.I'd call it quite a respectful remake, they of course out a new spin on it, but they keep some scenes, they even keep some of the music, I suppose they knew full well that some things were worth keeping.I loved the backstory of Michael, we see him go from troubled child to brutal killer.What it certainly is, is violent, not so much in terms of suspense, there are no scares, or those moments when you see him appear from a shadow, you get some brutal scenes, as you'd expect from Me Zombie.Nailed it, 8/10."]
