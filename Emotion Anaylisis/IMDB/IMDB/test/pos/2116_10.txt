["Well, I don't really know how to evaluate this picture. It's not really a movie, but a filmed production of stage play before an audience with the original Broadway cast. I'm not really big on musicals to begin with, and when you tamper with historical accuracy it's a bit much to take in. So on one side, there's no denying the amount of work and effort that went into this effort. The energy level, costuming and lively presentation all make for a richly entertaining experience for those who enjoy this type of spectacle. On the other hand, retooling history with an agenda of diversity doesn't sit well with this viewer, so it was difficult to maintain any semblance of an attention span. Based solely on it's value as an entertainment vehicle, the movie deserves a top rating, but given my reservations about it's substance, I'll be fair minded and offer my rating of '8'."]
