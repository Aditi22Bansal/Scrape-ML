["I will give it to ready or not, it does not let up! The whole movie is just utter insanity from the beginning to the last second. You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something."]
