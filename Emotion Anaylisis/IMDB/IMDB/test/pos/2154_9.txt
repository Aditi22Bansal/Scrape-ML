['Alex Garland\'s "Ex Machina" struck me as a warning about over-reliance on technology. Like "Frankenstein" and "2001: A Space Odyssey", it depicts human creations that turn out to be more than we can handle. I found Oscar Isaac\'s CEO to be the most interesting character in the movie. Nathan\'s lively, articulate personality is a stark contrast to Caleb\'s soft-spoken attitude. The Turing test (an assessment of a machine\'s ability to display human characteristics) should be of more interest to us now that "The Imitation Game" has drawn attention to Alan Turing."Ex Machina" won\'t be a movie for everyone. Despite the science fiction themes, it\'s a deliberately slow-moving film. It takes time to acquaint oneself with the characters and their true aims. But it turns out to be a interesting movie. It\'s not any kind of masterpiece, but I recommend it.']
