['Tim Burton presents his dark, but comedic style in stop-motion animation. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS(1993) was a critical and theatrical success; and this black comedy is just as much fun to watch. The visuals are just outstanding; beauty comes in many forms. Victor(Johnny Depp)lives in a small 19th century European village, where the shy groom-to-be rehearses his wedding to Victoria(Emily Watson)and meets a beautiful, but deceased young corpse bride(Helena Bonham Carter),fresh from the grave; who actually is under the impression she has just married him.Other voices you may or may not recognize: Christopher Lee, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, Paul Whithouse, Jane Horrocks and Danny Elfman, who also provides the undeniably great soundtrack.']
