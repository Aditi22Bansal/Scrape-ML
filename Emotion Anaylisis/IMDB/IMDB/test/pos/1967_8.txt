["This installment picks up 8 years after the previous film. Harvey Dent is still praised as a hero while Batman (Christian Bale) has gone into hiding as a criminal. Our new criminal is Bane (Tom Hardy). He wears a breather mask that makes him look like Hannibal Lechter, but sound like Darth Vader. He is huge and strong plus he has those fancy gizmos and loyal men who work for him. He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil. She is perhaps the most complex character in the story. The film has an incredible amount of action with important plot points happening nearly all the time. You don't want to go out for popcorn during the feature, you will be lost when you return. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Blake, a police officer/detective who grew up in an orphanage...do you see it coming?PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."]
