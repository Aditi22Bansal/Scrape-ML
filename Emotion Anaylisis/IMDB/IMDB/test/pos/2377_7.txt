["It's the 60s on a New England island. Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe. He falls for Suzy Bishop who lives on the island with her parents. The two awkward outsider teens run away setting off chaos among the other characters.This is Wes Anderson's movie all the way through. There is no mistaking his style. He is now as recognizable as any film style ever made. Everything is set up for a good flowing story. They have a dangerous storm bearing down on them. People are out looking for them. But then they're caught midway thru the movie.It detours a bit after that. The pace slows and the story rambles on. It's still very compelling, but it could have been much simpler and better. The kids are great. We have Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand. There are big time stars and they are all solid in their roles. Overall a very good job."]
