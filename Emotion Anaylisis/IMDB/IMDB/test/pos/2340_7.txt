["It's 1935 England. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is an imaginative writer who witnesses her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and servant's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Robbie is thinking about going to medical school with her father's help. Briony has a crush on Robbie. When cousin Lola Quincey gets raped, Briony's false accusation sends Robbie to prison. Four years later, Robbie is in France retreating towards Dunkirk. He has been released from prison to join the Army. Cecilia cannot forgive Briony (Romola Garai) who has abandoned Cambridge to do something useful as a nurse. Briony is haunted by her mistake as she writes her story.This is beautifully shot and acted. It's worthwhile for multiple viewings. There are epic scenes like Dunkirk and memorably constructed ones like the fountain. It can be slow at times but it's never tired. The biggest change I would add is the important rape scene. I think it's important to show the man's identity to the audience. Here's the thing. It's not a needed mystery except for Briony. It's obviously not Robbie but it would be more intense to know for sure."]
