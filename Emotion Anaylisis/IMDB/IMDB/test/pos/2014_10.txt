['This film tells the story of a African American man who travels to see his Caucasian girlfriend\'s parents in their house in the countryside. Though they seem to profusely welcome him, there is something not right about the whole setup. Soon his hunch turns into a deadly reality."Get Out" has a rather slow pacing to start with, as the story develops and the stage is set. The racial topic is brought up a little to often to be comfortable, but soon the reason for these strange encounters become apparent. The story is thrilling, and there is quite a bit of mystery in the film. The ending is unnerving and unexpected. The audience were very engaged with the film; gasps and applause were quite frequent towards the ending climax. It is an enjoyable thriller.']
