['This film tells the story of a new genetically modified dinosaur that would become the newest attraction of a theme park. However, the dinosaur runs loose, causing massive destruction and casualties.I still remember the first "Jurassic Park" twenty years ago, when it was so groundbreaking that it led to a whole generation of people worldwide to be enormously interested in dinosaurs. Though "Jurassic World" may not have the same effect, it still provides a very entertaining and thrilling experience. The dinosaurs are as real as ever, and their brutality is well portrayed. I am also impressed by the two kids, they did very well on screen. The plot tells a cat and mouse chase that provides a constant thrill. The life and death situations made me feel in edge, grabbing my seat very often. I enjoyed the film a lot.']
