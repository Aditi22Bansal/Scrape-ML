['I\'m not going to say much about this film, "Predestination," except to say that if you\'re interested in time travel films, this is a must- see.Ethan Hawke gives a terrific performance, as does Sarah Snook.The film deals with time travel, looping, time dimensions, and much more as an agent is charged with stopping a bomber in the past who is going to bomb 11 blocks of New York City and kill 11,000 people.I consider myself fairly intelligent, and I like time travel movies, but they have to be a lot simpler than this one in order for me to follow it. My idea of time travel is "Back to the Future" or "The Time Machine."I only had a partial idea of what this one was about. The very experienced viewers on Predestination\'s message board cleared up a few things.This film demands a second viewing. Intriguing and fascinating.']
