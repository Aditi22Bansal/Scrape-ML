["A character study of obsession and growing madness, this is a film which makes up for a dearth of action by incorporating lots of suspense and subtle increases in tension into the running time. It's an exercise in psychological creepiness, boasting a near-flawless performance from Robin Williams, whose acting is introverted and subdued this time, instead of the awful loud comic character we have grown accustomed to from his earlier career. In fact, this might well be the best film of his long career. Without Williams, I'm not sure the film would be so successful in what it sets out to do; indeed, I can't imagine anyone else essaying the part as well as he does here: lonely, balding, blond-haired and totally alienated from the rest of society, he's a man without a life, whose obsession with a 'normal' family leads to tragedy.The surprising thing is that many scenes are riveting, despite not a lot happening. Moments when Williams faces the disapproval of his boss (Gary Cole, in another wonderfully nasty and impassioned turn) are engrossing, whilst the hotel set-piece at the finale keeps you guessing for as long as possible. Not sure I'm totally in favour of the (anti) climax, but at least it does away with clich√© and presents things in a far more realistic light than we often see in the movies. Sober, surprisingly intelligent and insightful: worth watching for Williams alone."]
