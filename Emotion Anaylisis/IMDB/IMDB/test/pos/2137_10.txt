["There are not many actors who can do that creepy thing and still pull the viewer in. Don't get me wrong the script is amazing too, but you need someone like Jake Gyllenhaal to pull the main role off. The movies pace is slow though and this might not be exactly what everyone will love. You have to be patient and you have to go through tough scenes and character drama to watch this.It's a man on a mission thing and the question that can be raised is: Chicken or egg? Who's fault is it really? Because you do get pressured into certain situations which make some people break. Especially if they were on the edge anyway ... or over it a long time ago ... Whatever the case, be prepared for some tough watching ... literally."]
