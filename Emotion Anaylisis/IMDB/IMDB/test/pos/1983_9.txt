['if you looking for historical accuracy, for solid Medieval drama, for dramatic scenes and for old fashion historical movies, this is the worst choice. if you like an eccentric cocktail of modern music and Medieval pretext, easy story and Heath Lodger in a good role, this is a must see. because it is real seductive against it. predictable but nice. hilarious , unrealistic and chaotic. a sort of teenager game. but great in a way who has not exactly definition. because it is the sort of film for fun who could be reasonable kick to discover the truth about a period who, in this film, remains only a generous sketch.']
