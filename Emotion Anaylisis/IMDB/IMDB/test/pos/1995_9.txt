['"Ready Player One" is a film for fans of CGI, videogame and pop culture. In 1982, "TRON" was a magic film for a generation not familiar with virtual world and other cyber concepts, causing a great impact. "Ready Player One" does not offer the same impact and is tiresome in many moments but entertains youngster and open-minded older people. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Jogador NÂº 1" ("Player #1")']
