["As the resistance grows, Katniss is driven to exact personal retribution from President Snow. But Snow still has some tricks up his sleeve, all is not as it seems, and Peta still bears the scars of his brainwashing.And so The Hunger Games reaches its conclusion, the third book having been stretched into two movies, as is the fashion koff moneygrubbing instincts of Hollywood. This has been a dark series, and so the final film is probably the darkest (to some extent, literally â€“ the wholly unnecessary 3D means that there are times when it is almost unseeable, though never unwatchable). And, I am pleased to report, the inherent darkness is not abandoned in favour of a conventional happy wrap-up. Matters are resolved satisfactorily, but not necessarily happily: PanEm has been through too much to be happy for quite some time.Katniss is an interesting character: always (necessarily) strong, but never particularly likable, this has been a good character and series for Jennifer Lawrence, during which we have seen her career progress from promising newcomer to supremely talented all-rounder. And in this final part she gets her best scene of all: a scene on a par with Josh Hutcherson's final scene in episode 3, whereby the audience is shown what this experience has done to the characters.This is a strong finish to a good series."]
