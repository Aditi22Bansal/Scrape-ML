['A rookie FBI agent enlists a wildlife tracker to help solve a murder on a native American reservation.Writer/director Taylor Sheridan brings to life a tale which illustrates a forgotten class of people - missing native American women, the only group for whom no records are kept. Worse, any investigation into such cases is hobbled by jurisdictional uncertainties and wrangles. This underlies a story which is brutal and very emotional. JeremyvRenner and Elizabeth Olsen star, but everyone in it is quite excellent.I was grimly enterta8ned, but also appalled.']
