['"Predestination" is a very good sci-fi film. I enjoyed it very much, but I should warn you...it\'s very strange and a bit confusing. This doesn\'t mean it\'s bad...it has lots of neat twists and turns and is worth your time.\nThe film is about a temporal agent (Ethan Hawke) who is blown up, but not killed, at the beginning of the film. After extensive surgeries and rehabilitation, he is sent on another case....in order to recruit a new temporal agent. When he meets this future agent, John tells his life story...which is very sad and weird. But if you think this is weird...just keep watching!The acting, writing and direction are all very good. I also enjoyed Sarah Snook and her dual roles. There really isn\'t any other film like it...and I will wrap it up quickly, as I don\'t want to ruin it for you by revealing too much of the plot.']
