['"Luca" is Pixar\'s boldest attempt yet at an LGBTQ+ friendly film, though apparently it\'s still subtle enough (hard for me to believe) for the gay themes to go right over a viewer\'s head. My mom, for instance, didn\'t catch any of it at all.I had low expectations going in, but I found this movie to be very sweet and pretty delightful. Jacob Tremblay does terrific voice work as Luca, and the relationship between the two male characters at the story\'s center, whether you choose to read it as a coming out story or just a very close bond, is touching without being aggressively manipulative in that way Pixar movies can sometimes be.Plus, the pasta in this movie looks soooooo good that my family went on an Italian food binge for about a week after seeing it.Grade: A.']
