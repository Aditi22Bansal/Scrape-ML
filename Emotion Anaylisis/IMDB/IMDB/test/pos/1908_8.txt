['Surprisingly entertaining and informational biopic. Born in Zanzibar, Farrokh Bulsara came to England in his teens and in spite of a slightly odd appearance changed his professional name to Freddie Mercury (Rami Maleck). In 1970 the band Queen was formed and this flick follows the first 15 years of its roller coaster rise to stardom culminating with their historical Live Aid performance in 1985. A must see for even the most fickle of rock music fan. Malek turns in an excellent version of Mercury worth a Best Male Oscar Award.A powerful soundtrack and a cast that also features:: Gwilym Lee, Joseph Mazzello, Lucy Boynton, Adian Gillen, Aaron McCusker, Ace Bhatti, Mike Myers and Dermot Murphy as Bob Geldorf.']
