['Having battled Nazis comically in "Inglourious Basterds", Brad Pitt now does so seriously in "Fury". He plays a staff sergeant commanding a Sherman tank through Nazi Germany. This movie shows World War II in its gritty details, although I admit that it probably doesn\'t compare to being in the midst of a battlefield. One of the most interesting scenes is when the platoon takes the town and spends some time with a pair of German women: it\'s a brief period of peaceful interaction between presumed enemies, just like the 1914 Christmas truce.It\'s a really good movie. There are some pretty intense battle scenes, but most importantly, the characters are people whom the audience can care about. In the end, I think that the countries that participated in World War I need to take a serious look at how the Versailles Negotiations precipitated World War II. In addition to the millions of lives senselessly lost in the WWI - not to mention the Armenian Genocide - the Versailles Negotations simply placed new colonizers in Africa and Asia, and destroyed Germany economically, setting the stage for Hitler\'s rise to power.Anyway, it\'s a movie that I recommend. Definitely see it.']
