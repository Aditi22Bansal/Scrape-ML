['Perhaps not as scary as "The Exorcist", "The Conjuring" still has it\'s moments, relying on a slow build of tension and paranoia that manifests as demonic possession in the character of Carolyn Perron (Lilki Taylor) when the story really hits it\'s stride. The picture is based on the real life work of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, depicted in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. I didn\'t know this picture pre-dated 2014\'s "Annabelle", so was taken aback a bit when an opening scene made use of that character. Ultimately, Annabelle\'s connection with the movie is not notable in and of itself, except as a centerpiece of the real life Warren\'s occult museum. There\'s a scene in the movie that\'s reminiscent of Hitchcock\'s "The Birds" which I thought was a little too obvious given the genre but it doesn\'t linger too long. The horror effects in the film are rather sensational, especially those that place members of the Perron family in harm\'s way by invisibly and violently thrashing them around; the upside down seated Lorraine on the ceiling was particularly chilling. When the main story is over, a reference is made that horror movie insiders will understand when Ed Warren makes note of an investigation he and his wife are about to undertake in Long Island. It\'s not mentioned by name, but fans will recognize it as "The Amityville Horror".']
