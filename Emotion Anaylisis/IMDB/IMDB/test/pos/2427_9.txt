['This film is about the prince of Asgard who gets banished to the Earth for his impulsive action to protect his father\'s realm."Thor" is quite refreshing as it mixes historical drama with modern day life in a science fiction context. Such a blend may seem out of place in other films, but "Thor" blends these ideas well. The plot is well explained and engaging. Visuals are great, especially the roaring clouds and the fight scenes on the bridge. Both Thor and Loki are superbly depicted characters. Everything from the characters, story and visuals are so convincing and real. "Thor" is very entertaining, but it is more than just a popcorn summer blockbuster.']
