["A movie trying to prove that dysfunction may be the functional societal norm clearly runs out of steam as it progresses.When a drug dealer is hired to get drugs, he brings along people at random to make it appear that he is a family man. The group includes false wife Jennifer Aniston, a stripper, a run-away daughter to serve as his daughter and a neighbor's son, who has been abandoned by his mother.The film is devoted to the adventures of the group trying to get the drugs. This proves to be far more dangerous than they had ever imagined. Meetings include seeing a supposedly conventional family with the wife having lesbian like tendencies.It is interesting in that along the way, this group actually starts to act like a family, in caring for one another."]
