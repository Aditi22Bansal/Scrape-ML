["The big screen adaptation of the musical version of Les Mis√©rables has Anne Hathaway knock it out of the park with an emotional version of 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Hugh Jackman shows that he can easily glide from action star to all round singing and dancing entertainer. Russell Crowe despite fronting his own band needs a few more singing lessons.Victor Hugo's epic tells the story of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) in 19th century France. Jailed for stealing a loaf of bread and running when chased. He spent years in jail and then more years hunted by the determined policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) for breaking his parole conditions.Valjean has become rich and successful and tried to do good for others. However he failed factory girl Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whose life descended in misery and prostitution. To make amends he takes care of her daughter Cosette. However Valjean cannot escape his past and France is heading for revolution.This is a big musical spectacle. Director Tom Hooper knows which big set pieces to stage for the cinema. Although the novel is long, the film is too long. Some of the songs are rather forgettable. I thought Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were just a little bit too fruity."]
