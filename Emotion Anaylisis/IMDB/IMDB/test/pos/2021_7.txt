["If like me, you're a fan of suspense, and love a movie packed with tension, then this one will tick a lot of boxes for you. It's very dark, at times a little grim, and I guess on occasion you'll need to suspend belief, but it's gripping, very cleverly crafted, edge of the seat viewing. The film felt very different to other horror/thrillers I've seen recently, there was a fair bit of originality to it.The first half of the film was somewhat moderate, built up tension, some moments where you watch and literally can't breathe. The second half of the film trebles the tension, at times the tension is almost unbearable, it was expertly done.The turkey baster scene had everyone squealing at the cinema, and like my title suggests, it'll be a long time before I want Turkey dinner again!!A mighty fine watch, 8/10"]
