["Lara Croft has been rebooted as an origins film but it is a lacklustre pastiche of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) works as a poor bike courier in London, unable to afford to go to university. Even though her missing father Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) controlled many companies now run by associate Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas.)Lara could claim her father's companies and fortune if she legally declared him dead. However Lara finds a clue that leads to a message to destroy his research about Queen Himiko's tomb. She goes off to Hong Kong to look for her father and his search for the mystical tomb on an island near Japan. As Lara's search progresses she learns new skills.An illogical story, a generic bad guy, some messy action scenes and Vikander lacks the pneumatic assets of Angelina Jolie. The film never progresses much from its video game roots."]
