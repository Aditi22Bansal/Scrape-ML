["In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by a skilled assassin. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks that somebody is trying to kill all the heroes. Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is semi-retired and thinks Rorschach is too paranoid. Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a wealthy celebrity. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the all-powerful all-seeing indestructible superhero. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) had put away her Silk Spectre identity and trying to maintain a human relationship with Dr. Manhattan. Her mother Sally (Carla Gugino) was the original Silk Spectre but is now a drunk.It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road."]
