['The Indy style movie has become so popular, major studios have copied it. This film has a well written script, effective sound track, excellent acting, background distractions, and of course quirky memorable characters. The film might may be best classified as a light drama, leaning toward comedy.In this 1965 tale two misfit 12 year kids conspire to run off together. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a teased orphan scout. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is the daughter of two lawyers. They live on a New England island. A search party for the two missing youths is lead by "sad dumb policeman" Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Captain Sharp is having an affair with the mother of Suzy (Frances McDormand). Bill Murray plays the rather straight husband.There is a scene where the two youths get close to each that made me uncomfortable for a moment. Fortunately the scene didn\'t last long and the film returned to its quirky self, with bits of dark comedy. While it is PG-13, I wouldn\'t want my 13 year old to watch it. It might give them ideas.This is Kara Haywood\'s first full length film. I see a great career for her.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Kara Haywood in bra/undies. Some groping.']
