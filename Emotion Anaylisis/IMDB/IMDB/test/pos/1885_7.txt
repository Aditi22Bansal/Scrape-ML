['This film tells the most severe case of haunting Ed and Lorraine Warren, two outstanding paranormal investigators, have ever seen.I am not a fan of horror movies, but "The Conjuring" truly blew me away. Everything from the plot, acting and the atmosphere of the film is superb. The story is believable, the family is likable and viewers are sympathetic of them stuck in a haunted house. The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, "The Conjuring" builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it. It is easily the scariest film I have ever seen.I was already impressed by "Insidious", and "The Conjuring" makes me a fan of James Wan. When his next film comes out I will surely watch it.']
