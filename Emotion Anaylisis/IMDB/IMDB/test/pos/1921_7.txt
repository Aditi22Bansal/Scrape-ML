['We start out years later as our foursome make it the White House. Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone are together while Abigail Breslin wants a boyfriend. The zombies have evolved and the action moves to Graceland. The film has all of the regulars (Bill Murray in a flashback) and addition cast was great especially Zoey Deutch who stole all the scenes she was in as a near mindless individual.They make references to events in the first film as if you have seen it.Great mindless fun. I even caught the Steinbeck reference.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity']
