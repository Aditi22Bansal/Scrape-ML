["While far less engaging than other Gaspar Noé movies, Love explores the love life of its very unlikeable protagonist with all the stylish editing, beautiful cinematography and explicit sex you would expect from him.It's almost impossible to feel any sympathy for its main character, but his story was still mostly interesting to watch. The sex scenes tie together an okay drama elevated by Noé's unique style.Artistically and technically impressive, though aside from its unsimulated sex scenes and some trippy sequences, doesn't offer the type of out-of-body experience that most Noé fans would expect."]
