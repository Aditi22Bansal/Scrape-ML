['Apart from the "based on true ..." thing on the beginning, which by the way is my new big NO for a movie ... I just can\'t stand that hypocritical use of this phrase. Every other movie is than based on true events. Most of the romantic comedies are, teen comedies etc. etc. At least some parts are true or did happen in real life, which is why the script writer "thought" them up ...But I should stop ranting about that (and the fact, that a voice over at the beginning of the movie, isn\'t entirely "correct" ... well you see). This movie promises to scare you and it delivers. Mood-wise it stays close to a french movie called "Ils" (Them), which was a great suspense thriller/horror. I also liked the relationships between the two main characters. You could say it\'s standard fare, but it has great framing and lighting (sound design is "scary" too).']
