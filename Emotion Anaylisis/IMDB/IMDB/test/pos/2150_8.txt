['This the story of Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), a pretty girl with blond hair who is also a brilliant student (how original it is!). With her boyfriend, Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson), they are living love\'s dream. But one day, he\'s leaving her by announcing him that he\'s engaging in a politic career. For this, he\'ll study law in a brilliant university. You can guess easily Witherspoon\'s feelings: sadness, frustration but revenge too. In order to have her revenge and to get her darling again, she\'s registering in the same university... This is from this moment on that the movie becomes poor. "Legally Blonde" is a bad movie because it\'s based on a cock and bull screenplay that often falls into foolishness and it includes several unlikelinesses. Even in one hour and a half, you find time to get bored and this movie that is supposed to be a comedy isn\'t funny at all, in the long run. So I can\'t believe that this movie is rather well marked: 6.6 out10!.Uneventful and boring. At a pinch can we save Reese Witherspon \'s rather good performance.']
