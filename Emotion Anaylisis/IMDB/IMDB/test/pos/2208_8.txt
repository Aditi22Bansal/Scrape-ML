["Something Borrowed is a brilliant laugh-out-loud comedy. I guarantee you'll laugh so hard your sides will hurt! I am in love with this movie! It is so hilarious I almost fell out of my set at the theater! The visual aspects of this film are great because of the crisp images and the dialogue is so funny. My favorite character is Ethan because he is so blunt and straight forward. There is no hiding his emotions and I laugh at almost every thing he says and does! Something that is so clever about this movie is that it is very emotional, so you can go from cracking up to crying in one scene.The only thing that really bothers me about this film is the ending. I do not think Dex and Claire should be together in the end, I mean, I know they wait for 6 years but it just doesn't sit right with me and I feel bad for how Claire and Darcy's relationship ended up.This movie is for ages 13 and up because teens and adults will love it for the hilarious adult humor and it is pretty inappropriate for children under 13.So if you're 13 and want to watch a fun film, go check it out. I loved it! Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"]
