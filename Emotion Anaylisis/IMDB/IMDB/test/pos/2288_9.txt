['In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in "The Prestige". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan\'s others. There\'s the non-linear plot, like "Memento"; one-upmanship, like "Insomnia"; the question of morality, like in "The Dark Knight". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier\'s and Borden\'s rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla\'s (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It\'s both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are "The Illusionist" and "Scoop" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).']
