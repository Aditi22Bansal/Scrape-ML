["Mel Brooks makes one of the best parody films ever with this comedy about the gradnson of Dr. Frankenstein (Gene Wilder is terrific) who inherits his grandfather's mansion.  He like his old man is also a doctor, and sees he has a new assistant, Igor (pronounced as eye-gor in perfection by Marty Feldman).  But soon, he is enfatuated with a book his grandfather wrote (How I Did It) and creates a monster.  Hilarious escapades in this goofy yet quotabe comedy parodying all the frankenstein movies and even creates some Brooksfilm cliche's.  Very funny every time I watch it.  Written by Brooks and Wilder.  Gene Hackman gives the funniest part of the movuie spoofing the Blind Man from the first Frankenstein.  A+"]
