["Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty thieve in L.A. He encounters Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is filming a car crash. He decides to get into the business of freelance videography for the local news. He is unrestrained in his filming which is exactly what news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) needs to raise her low ratings. Desperate Rick answers his ad to be his assistant. This is great acting from Gyllenhaal. His crazy eyes pull in the audience right away. In fact, it's shocking to see his gaunt figure. His mannerisms are really creepy. The story is driven by this great performance and the tension never lets up."]
