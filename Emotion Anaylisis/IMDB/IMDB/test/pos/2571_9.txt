['This film tells the story of a rich paraplegic man in Paris, who gives a chance to a man who was just released from prison."Intouchables" is a really touching and inspirational story. I really like the fact that both Philippe and Driss are so wildly different from each other, but yet they can complement each other and make each other grow. Philippe is cultured but reserved, while Driss is playful and hedonistic. I like the scenes where Philippe is selling the painting by Driss, the scene in the opera and the final scene. They complement each other so well, and they both treasure each other\'s friendship. It\'s a beautiful tale of mutual inspiration. I love it.']
