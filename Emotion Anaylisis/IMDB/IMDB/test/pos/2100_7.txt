["Sometimes things are just so wrong. Just a short time after Amanda (America Olivo ) gets us all excited, she flames out leaving us frustrated and wanting more.Things happen fast and furious from that point, and we realize that the movie hasn't really started as we are zapped six weeks into the future. Five people are gone, presumably dead, and we have a whole new group.We don't know what happened to Whitney (Amanda Righetti), and now her brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) is looking for her.Another throat slashed as the rag comes off and the hockey mask goes on.What is it with great breast and a quick death? Chelsea (Willa Ford) goes water-skiing topless and Jason (Derek Mears) lets her know what he thinks.We now know that he has been keeping Whitney alive for some reason. She has to watch him haul in the dead bodies.Trent (Travis Van Winkle) and Bree (Julianna Guill) are getting it on big time, You know she will be next. The only thing that can save her is the fact that there are two minorities present. Don't they always go first? Oh, Yes, Jason really showed some stuff with Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta).I watched Friday the 13th for two reasons. I'm guessing by now that I am going to be cheated out of one.If you are looking for a good slasher movie and you are not hung up on the title, Friday the 13th is good.Perfect ending!"]
