["Legally Blonde has Reese Witherspoon playing Elle a vacuous blonde who anticipates a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner Huntington III but instead gets dumped.Warner plans to study law at Harvard and in a stalkerish move, Elle follows suit and somehow gets accepted hoping Warner changes his mind about her.At Harvard, Elle has trouble being accepted by Warner's friends and by the more intense students.However she applies herself and gets to assist in a murder trial and manages to show that she has more skills in the application of the law.This is a light, breezy film turned into a hit musical thanks to producer of the film Marc Platt who also produced 'Wicked' on stage.It has all the beats with Elle struggling at Law School then being befriended by Luke Wilson. She then becomes part of the defence attorney team for Ali Larter who stands trial for murder.Witherspoon is winning in the lead role and brings likability but the film is all froth."]
