['Definitely it defied the totem of starcast to hit a movie; go and watch Bhuj and you would cry out your heart for its that pathetic. On the other hand, this movie had almost all the elements of a war/drama movie: environment builtup, cinematography, vfx, war scenes, a benign love story, good acting skills, and of course, screenplay. Amazing.']
