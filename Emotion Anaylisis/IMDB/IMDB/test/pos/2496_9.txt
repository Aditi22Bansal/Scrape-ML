['Somewhere between it\'s Golden Globes win as Best Picture, and my sister\'s dismissal of the film as boring, lies the reputation of "Brokeback Mountain" as a film of significance. Prepared for either eventuality, I found the movie to have handled it\'s subject rather well, without being overtly or gratuitously graphic. As to it\'s greatness, that will be left to the test of time.The performances by the leads, as well as the supporting cast was realistic and engaging, lending credibility to the story. Director Ang Lee never ceases to amaze, with films as diametrically opposed as "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Hulk", and now "Brokeback Mountain. Where does the creative vision for handling such themes come from?I can\'t say for sure if handling Jack\'s death within the story might have carried more force though, as opposed to it being dealt with in almost a flashback sort of way. Still tragic of course, but to my thinking, it would have guaranteed a more dramatic impact if done as part of the story in real time.Curiosity about the film prompted me to go see it; having done so I can say it was a worthwhile experience. It\'s good to see a controversial subject handled maturely and with creativity. Now let\'s see what Oscar says.']
