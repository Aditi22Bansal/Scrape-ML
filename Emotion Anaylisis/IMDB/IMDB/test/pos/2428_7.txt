['This is the first feature animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky. I knew of him previously from his work on Cartoon Network\'s "Samurai Jack" which I remember being quite amused by. So now he\'s made this computer-animated one about Dracula and his daughter and his attempts to keep her from encountering some humans since he\'s very much prejudiced against them which gets a good explanation as the film goes on. I\'ll stop there and just say how funny and touching the whole thing was which wasn\'t surprising since not only was Tartakovsky involved but a lot of former "SNL"ers which not only included co-writer Robert Smigel but also the voices of Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Andy Samberg, and Chris Parnell. Oh, and one of my favorite lines concerns how the Dracula character is appalled by how some people think his kind says "Bla, bla, bla". How hilarious! Okay, so on that note, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania.']
