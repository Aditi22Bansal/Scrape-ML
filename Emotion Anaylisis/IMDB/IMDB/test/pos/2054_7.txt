["Visually, Raya and the Last Dragon is a treat. The animation of this movie is engaging, and the colors & textures are enthralling. The plot isn't anything new, though. It's derivative of many stories we've seen before, so it's fairly predictable. However, this film will keep kids entertained and it won't annoy adults. It's not the best Disney has to offer, but it's still pretty good."]
