['Tom Cruise plays an ad man army Major who, through the whim of a commander, finds himself heading into combat against an alien force of spider-like creatures that have the ability to restructure time. Cruise is killed numerous times by these things and always come back to the same place. He learns more about the mission and the creatures each time he goes back. In the process, he meets a female war hero played by Emily Blunt who has the same time warping thing going on. The proceed to relive the same times over and over. She, unfortunately, has no recollection of what was done. This is powerful, intelligent science fiction with a knock dead premise. Yes, "Wake up, Maggot" is this movie\'s "I Got You, Babe," from "Groundhog Day." And the idea of reliving our day over and over isn\'t brand new, but the battle scenes are awesome and the aliens powerful and disgusting. There is a wonderful bond that develops between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It isn\'t the maudlin empty headed stuff like we saw in "Independence Day" many years ago. We really get to care about the people. This movie really surprised me.']
