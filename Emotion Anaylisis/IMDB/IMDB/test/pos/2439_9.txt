["Or even the summer as another reviewer stated! But before I start the review, I have to say/admit, that I don't or better didn't know much about the Transformers world, before I went out to watch the movie. So I can't tell you any differences between the movie and the series or if they forgot/missed something, reinvented the Transformers or anything like that.What I can tell you, is that this movie delivers exactly what it promises. Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!"]
