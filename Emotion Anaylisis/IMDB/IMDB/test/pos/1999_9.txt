["Internship is funny and it might work better or worse for you depending if you like the main actors or not. It has some very funny scenes and even the construction itself does work, even though you do know where it all is going to (predictable would be the word you're looking for in that case).Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have a great chemistry, they do exactly what you'd expect them to do (actually Vince hasn't surprised anyone in years, either amused or annoyed the viewers). Some of the supporting cast is really nice though. We have one guy who is a regular at the Today Show (with Jon Stewart), who has only a few scenes, but is funny as hell (as expected, too), but the rest of the bunch does have their fair share of moment to shine too. If you can sit through the obvious, you'll have fun"]
