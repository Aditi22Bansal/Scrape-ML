["Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos) is in high school starting to date pretty boy Thomas (Jérémie Laheurte). However Emma (Léa Seydoux) with her blue hair catches her eye. She can't stop fantasizing about her and don't find Thomas satisfying. She is depressed and breaks up with Thomas. Her friend Béatrice (Alma Jodorowsky) flirts with her. However the next day, Béatrice rejects her. Then her gay friend Valentin (Sandor Funtek) brings her to a gay bar and later that night, she meets the older Emma. Her friends start berating her for being a lesbian.Taking the salaciousness aside, this is basically a coming of age movie. The confusion is palpable. Adèle gives a naturalistic performance. The pacing is quite slow. The movie spends time hanging out with these two characters. When it gets confrontational, the tension gets very high. It's a movie that breaks the audience down until they feel as raw as the character."]
