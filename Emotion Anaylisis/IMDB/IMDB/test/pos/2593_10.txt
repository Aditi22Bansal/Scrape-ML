['... another Pixar hit. And it tastes and looks like one too! Concerning the latter: We\'re used that Pixar movies look good (other animation studios can keep up with the looks), but it\'s the story, the characters and maybe a magic ingredient, that differentiates Pixar from other studios ...So maybe Cars wasn\'t really Pixars best movie (it really wasn\'t, although if that\'s the baddest they get, than they don\'t have to worry at all!), but they made up for that with this movie. While the low expectations (mine) for a movie involving a car were met, some people might have been more than surprised, that the "rat"-story did work out! I can only recommend this very highly (doesn\'t matter if you\'re young or old, or even in-between), all you have to do is watch it ... unless you have a fear of rats and/or animated movies of course!']
