['In a small town in Denmark, the life of the kindergarten teacher Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) turns upside-down and is destroyed when Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), lies and tells to the director Grethe (Susse Wold) that he showed his sex to her."Jagten" is a Danish-Swedish drama with the storyline of These Three (1936) and The Children\'s Hour (1961). The cruel and heartbreaking story about how destructive a lie may be is updated and the screenplay well-written and with great performances. The commercial conclusion with Lucas apparently fixing his life again after all the bad things that happened to him is the weak part of the plot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Ca√ßa" ("The Hunt")']
