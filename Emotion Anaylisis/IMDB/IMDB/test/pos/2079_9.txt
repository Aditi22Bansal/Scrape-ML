["I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece."]
