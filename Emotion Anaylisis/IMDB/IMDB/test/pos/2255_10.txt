['The second "animated" feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993\'s THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot\'s perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I\'d say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn\'t lessen in any way the latter\'s remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.']
