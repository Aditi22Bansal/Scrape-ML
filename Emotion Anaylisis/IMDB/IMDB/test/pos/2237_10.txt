['To define it ? Profound dark is more than fine. Bloody ? Off course! But, more significant, example of high cinematography. And admirable storytelling. And not bad acting. A story dynamic and far to be comfortable and pure exces of CGI. But the result is more than the blockbuster who you expect or the modern version of the version of "80 s. It is a story about loneliness , fall of dictatorship and splendid occasion to see Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and Tom Hardy at work, in a film as large puzzle of memories about different influences. So, just great.']
