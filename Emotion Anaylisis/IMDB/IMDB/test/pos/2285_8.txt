["This is one of my favourite films in the series as it captures of the whimsy and magic of the book, tells a strong story and also has just the right amount of humour.The source material is used well and there aren't too many parts of the book that are left out unlike some of the other films.All the returning cast are good while the new additions of Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant all add that bit of class to the film.Newell has comedy experience and this is shown with characters like Fred and George all becoming a little more active in this film.Overall a strong film and the last consistently good instalment in this series before David Yates took over for the haphazard fifth instalment."]
