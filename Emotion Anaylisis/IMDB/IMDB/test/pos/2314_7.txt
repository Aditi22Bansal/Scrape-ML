['The eccentric manufacturer of chocolates and candies Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) promotes a tour through his chocolate factory, the greatest in the world, through five golden tickets hidden in the bars of chocolate. The poor and sweet boy Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) finds one, for the pride and joy of his very supportive family, and he spends the day in a mysterious competition for an unknown award with other four nasty boys and girls."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is a delightful and delicious adventure through the world of the fantasy. Tim Burton changes his usual morbid scenarios to very bright ones, and keeps the usual very weird character, magnificently performed by the awesome Johnny Depp. This movie is highly indicated for the whole family and it is an excellent entertainment. Unfortunately I have not had the chance to watch the original 1971 "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" to make a comparison, but this remake is really a great movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Fantástica Fábrica de Chocolates" ("The Fantastic Factory of Chocolates")']
