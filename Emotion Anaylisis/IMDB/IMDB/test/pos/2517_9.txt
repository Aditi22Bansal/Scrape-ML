['Blood, guts, tripes, death. Here are the key words to describe this absolute masterpiece. The true face of war. Far ahead before PRIVATE RYAN. And also a tank movie as were BEAST OF WAR, in 88, and STEEL LADY, back in the fifties. Brad Pitt is here so poignant, so terrific and Shaia Le BÂœuf has never been so good in a supporting character. The 135 minutes are not so long for the audience. And above all, SS troops are not shown as jerks. SS were butchers, assassins, beasts, yes, yes, yes, but certainly NOT jerks. The behaviour of one of them, at the end, is surprising and why not unbelievable. But why not? One last thing, the final battle begins in broad daylight and ends at night...But, again, why not?']
