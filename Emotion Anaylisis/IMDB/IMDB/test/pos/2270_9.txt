['This film is about a woman waking up from sleep to different puzzling events concerning her husband\'s life.I must say that the plot is excellent. It is difficult to put together a plot that involves intertwining present and future, and not to have any plot holes. Sandra Bullock\'s previous film, "The Lake House", was full of such plot holes. In contrast, the plot of "Premonition" is sound and has no plot holes. The present and future interacts with each other so that every piece of information has significance in the future. What\'s more important is that the outcome makes sense and not contradict each other. The initial confusion of Sandra Bullock is well presented, and I sympathise with her strange experience. The suspense is excellent and maintained throughout the movie. Things are revealed bit by bit, and finally everything falls into place. The ending is the best bit, but I will not reveal it. This film really captivated me, and I definitely recommend it!']
