['"Captain Marvel" is another entertaining superhero adventure. Maybe the most important is not the top-notch special effects but the humor and chemistry of the cute Brie Larson and the veteran Samuel L. Jackson. The screenplay could be improved with a better development of Carol Danvers and the alien war, but anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Capit√£ Marvel" ("Captain Marvel")']
