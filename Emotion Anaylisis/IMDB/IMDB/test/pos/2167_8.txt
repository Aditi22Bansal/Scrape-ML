['This is almost too silly for words, but I did like the idea of bringing back Frankenstein, Count Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and the Wolf Man together, all in one picture. Well, not really the Wolf Man, but close enough. It was almost like Van Helsing\'s (Hugh Jackman) sidekick Carl (David Wenham) was challenging the script writers with one of his own lines - "How many commandments can we break in one day?" Yet the production design is pretty good, and the principal players are easy enough on the eyes. The action scenes are pretty frantic, even if some of the CGI employed is a bit dodgy. I don\'t know about the flying vampire brides though, they could have been a bit sexier. The story reaches it\'s epic conclusion when the Werewolf Gabriel puts the bite on the Satanic Dracula. You want to know who they were, you\'ll have to watch the picture. I can\'t give everything away here.']
