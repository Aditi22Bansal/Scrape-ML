["A psychological thriller directed by Bryan Bertino. Forget popcorn and soft drinks; try a fistful of Xanax and adult diapers. Sorry, that was foolishly going overboard. THE STRANGERS will have you drowning in anxiety and listening to your own blood chill. A young suburban couple Kristen(Liv Tyler)and James(Scott Speedman)need some peace and quiet and time to think as they arrive at a secluded family vacation home. You don't always get what you want. Rapping at the door becomes bagging on the door. Strangers staring at the house and peeking through writing on the windows. It is a living nightmare as three masked strangers invade the couple's privacy. It is amazing what you can bring yourself to do when survival is on the line. This is not the time to hear someone at the door or your cellphone to ring. It is so much fun to be terrified."]
