['Jack Black is like Jim Carrey--he works so hard at his comedy that the strain at first overshadows the humour. But like Jim Carrey, he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can\'t help but be won over totally by his zaniness. I didn\'t think Black was very funny when this movie started, but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over. There seems to be a generation of film makers now (Richard Linklater, Cameron Crowe) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone "cool," and their movies are full of welcome messages. Cool isn\'t about how you look or dress or act. Cool\'s a state of mind, man. Peace out.Grade: A-']
