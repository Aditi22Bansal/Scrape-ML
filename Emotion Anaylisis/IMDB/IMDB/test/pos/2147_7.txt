["Impoverished Phineas Barnum marries a girl from a rich family against the wishes of her parents, and proceeds to make his fortune by presenting displays of the rare and unusual, including people with attributes which have them labelled as freaks.Hugh Jackman plays Barnum in a musical celebration of the positive elements of his career (as a frosty critic tells him, some might say that it is a celebration of humanity). His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride. Well, content-wise it is fairly standard fictional biopic stuff, but the musical numbers are the best I can recall for some time."]
