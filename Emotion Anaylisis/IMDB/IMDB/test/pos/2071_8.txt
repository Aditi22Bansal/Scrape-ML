["What I don't understand is the low rating for this amazing flick. Or maybe I do understand because the two females in it aren't wellknown for acting in gory flicks and here they do.It's funny in some moments, it's over the top gory and some situations you think, okay byt the result isn't what you expect, in other words, I can't go really deep into this because I would spoil a lot.Nevertheless, if you are a gorehound do pick this up. If you thnk you are going to see a romantic flick forget it. It's a pure no-brainer, one you see with your friends. Entertainment on a horror/comedy level. Sometimes Tucker And Dale (2010) comes to my mind for the gore attached not for the comedy. You get it, not a normal flick but did I love it.Gore 3,5/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 4/5\nStory 4/5\nComedy 2/5"]
