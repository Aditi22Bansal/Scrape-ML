['It kinda starts like a normal home invasion by a psycho movie. That vibe is out there and everyone can feel that. Even the title does suggest it. But there is so much more. It actually juggles more than one genre to be exact, not to mention that it might leave you befuddled a bit by the end or even during the movie. On many things, like the main actor, who apparently was in "Downton Abby". So if you know that show, his appearance here might "shock" you even more.The director cited a few inspirations (also from the Science Fiction genre) and having watched it through, it makes more than sense. There is a change of pace and it almost gets ridiculous towards the end, but I do love it. Just the central performance is so captivating, that it\'s hard not to feel entertained by the movie']
