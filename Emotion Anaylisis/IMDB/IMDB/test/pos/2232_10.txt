['Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they\'re supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth\'s "Knock Knock" is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of "Grindhouse" (Tarantino\'s collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the \'70s), and then co-starred in "Inglourious Basterds" as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of "Citizen Kane" and "Dr. Strangelove". If "Knock Knock" is any indication, Roth\'s own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.']
