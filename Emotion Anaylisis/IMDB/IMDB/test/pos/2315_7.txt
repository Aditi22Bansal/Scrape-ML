["Director Matthew Vaughn continues His Winning Streak with this Ultra-Violent Send-Up of the Slick Spy Movie. The Movie is so Sleek, Stylish, and Outrageous it is likely to Cause Spontaneous Orgasim among Teenagers and Hyper-Actives of all ages.All the Money spent on this Glorious, Gory, Goof is up there On the Screen. It Razzles and Dazzles in almost Every Scene. The Writing is Smart and Reverentially Reflective as the Tone Fluctuates between Irreverence and Irresponsibility.But a Good Time can be had by Those Willing to Allow for some Gut-Wrenching Displays of Murderous Mayhem and not so easy to take Comedy, like Our Hero's Reward for Saving the World that Ends this Exhausting Entertainment. That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance. Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before. The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.Recommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. as it Parodies he Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control. Behold...This is Art Imitating Life with a Swagger and a Smirk."]
