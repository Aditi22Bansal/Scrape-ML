['Writer/Director Jordan Peele\'s Follow-Up to the Immensely Popular and Critically Acclaimed "Get Out" (2018) is a Tense and Bloody Psychological Social Study.All Elements, Acting, Cinematography, Score, and, of course, Writing and Directing are Superb and Accomplished Far Beyond what\'s Expected from a Beginning Filmmaker.The Multi-Layered Story, that Runs almost 2 Hours, is Never Dull or Lacking in Scares, Suspense, and Build-Up to the Final Reveal.Much of the Slaughter and Gore takes place Off-Screen, but the Bloody-Aftermath is Forever Present.It\'s a much more Personally Terrifying Story than Most Horror Movies.It is Massaged with some Well-Placed and Off-Beat, yet Appropriate Humor.The Strange Musical Score with Emphasis on Sounds and Drawn-Out Musical Strains is Eerie and Enhances the Mood Considerably.The Underlying Thesis is mostly Revealed but some Ambiguity Remains for Consideration.Overall, Another Winner for Peele, the Cast and the Entire Production Crew.It\'s Really a Treat for Fans used to Less than Stellar Entries in the Overload of Cheap and Not Very Well Done Movies in the Genre.']
