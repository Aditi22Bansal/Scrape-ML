["Ethan Hawke is crime writer Ellison Oswalt. It's been 10 years since his breakout hit. He has moved his whole family into a murder house intending to write his new book on. The old family had all been hung in the old tree in the backyard, but the family's young daughter went missing. Strange things keep happening in the house. For example, he finds some 8mm snuff films in the attic, and discover there may be other related murders.Ethan Hawke is rock solid in driving this movie. This is all his movie. The atmosphere is amazing. If there's anything they desperately needed, it's some better supporting characters. The wife, the kids, the bumpkin young cop, they are all stock characters done by unknown actors. There're no standouts in those areas. The movie works from the creepy atmosphere that builds and builds."]
