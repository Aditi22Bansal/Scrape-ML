["We all know why they made this movie. You pay these kids next to nothing. And you promote it as a party movie. It's a classic money making move. The surprise here is that this was actually a pretty good movie. The kids aren't necessarily that likable or great actors. All of it is mostly recycled old teen movie parts. But it's the energy that so great. The utterly over the top chaos in this movie is just too much fun to ignore. The flamethrower does go too far. But it's too late to do any major damage. It just adds to the general chaos of this movie. Miles Teller is the biggest name to come out of this wild ride."]
