["I was never part of the cult following for this film. I saw it nearly 30 years ago. I went after midnight with a roommate and found the experience quite interesting. I don't criticize people for enjoying life and having fun with something like this. God knows, life can be boring at times and whatever puts a smile on your face and gets you through another day is OK with me. The movie itself is unlike anything I've seen. The songs are clever and over the top. From Tim Curry on down it is one strange kick after another. It is, of course, filled with every representative of what came to be the GLBT experience. It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later."]
