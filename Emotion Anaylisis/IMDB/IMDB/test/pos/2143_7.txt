["I read a bunch of very negative reviews on here for this movie and in my opinion those are a bit exaggerated. I agree that it's not the best DC-Comics movie ever made but it's certainly entertaining enough to have a good movie night. Margot Robbie is perfect to play Harley Quinn. It's a character that fits her really well. The plot is probably not perfect but it's never boring. It's all fast paced so you just relax and enjoy the ride, just what I expect from these kind of movies."]
