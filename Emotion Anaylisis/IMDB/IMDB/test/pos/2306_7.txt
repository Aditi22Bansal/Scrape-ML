['This film is about how Clark Kent grew up on Earth, and how he battles with the evil General from Krypton to save the Earth."Man of Steel" completely blew me away. Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It\'s easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe\'s integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams\' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill\'s superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing. It\'s such a powerful film that never ceases to amaze and inspire awe.']
