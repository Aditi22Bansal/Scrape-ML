['Well, I was pretty harsh in my reviews of "Leon:The Professional" and "La Femme Nikita" for different reasons, both by director Luc Besson. I find myself pretty much in the same position here. Not that this isn\'t a slick and stylish espionage thriller, but the action sequences defy all manner of credibility, making even John Wick a piker relative to body count when all the dust settles. I guess that\'s what one expects when going into a flick like this, but after a while it gets almost comical. The chronologically challenged time frames also don\'t help, and I can\'t say they were totally necessary to tell an effective story. What they provide are the unexpected twists involved in turning an assassin into a double agent, and then a triple agent, and I guess you could have gone on and on in that manner if the picture wanted to. There\'s also that slick use of a body double to mimic Anna (Sasha Luss) in some of the tighter spots she found herself in. With lowered expectations, this might fill the bill for action fans, but leave your thinking cap in the closet.']
