['In order to control future rebellions remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four player must kill each other and survive in the wilderness and only one wins. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population.In the District 12, the teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a great hunter and eximious archer. When her younger sister Primrose Everdeen is selected as one of the representative of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they head by train to the Capital to be trained to the brutal game. Who will win The Hunger Games?"The Hunger Games" is an entertaining rip-off "Battle Royale" mixed with any film about totalitarian society, such as "Logan\'s Run", "1984" or "Brave New World".I was curious to see this film due to the hype surrounding it, but the plot is not original and I have seen this type of story before. It is quite impossible to recognize Elizabeth Banks travestied in her androgynous character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Jogos Vorazes" ("Voracious Games")']
