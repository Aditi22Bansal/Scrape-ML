['When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it\'s funniest moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which does have some similarities to the movie "Very Bad Things", but does not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successful.The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active) role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he can display his comedic potential more than in "He\'s not that into you". Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I\'ve seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don\'t watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don\'t know what\'s gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it\'s all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don\'t know what they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I\'d love to see one! :o)']
