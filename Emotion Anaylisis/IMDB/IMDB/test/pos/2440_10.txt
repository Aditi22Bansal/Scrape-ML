['By now, "Cars" is an old film--and I am FINALLY getting around to reviewing it. So much for staying ahead of the curve! But because there are already a ton of reviews, I\'ll keep this short.So what did I like about the film? Well, the animation is just unreal-- it\'s gorgeous from start to finish. It\'s obvious that John Lasseter is insane for cars and put a ton of effort into this one. GORGEOUS! As for the rest of the film, it\'s quite good, though I wasn\'t quite as bowled over by it as some. After all, it now has a sequel, a semi-sequel ("Planes") and some spin-off \'Mater shorts. I don\'t think the film was THAT good. But it was clearly enjoyable and pleasant throughout. Well worth seeing though I wish that Pixar would stop emphasizing sequels and started work on more originality. I understand why they don\'t, as it\'s all about marketing--and they marketed the crap out of this film.']
