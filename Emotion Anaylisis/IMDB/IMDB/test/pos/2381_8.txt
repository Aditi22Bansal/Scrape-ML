['This film tells the story of a talented computer genius, who is invited to a mysterious research facility to test the latest artificial intelligence.I have heard many good things about "Ex Machina", and it certainly lives up to expectations. First of all, the physical location of the house is magnificent. The house itself is super stylish and modern, I like it so much that I want to live in it! Another great thing is that Domnhall Gleeson looks super young and innocent in the film, which is well suited to the surprise ending. Visuals of Ava are stunning because she looks so real.Suspense is well built and maintained throughout. The plot is so mysterious and intriguing. As I was watching the film, I came up with a few possibilities of how things may end, but I was only partially right. I very much enjoyed this film.']
