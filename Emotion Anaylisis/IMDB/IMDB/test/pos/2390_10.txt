["Exceedingly stupid but occasionally funny tale of two forty year old live at home guys who become step brothers when their parents marry.Its Will Ferrell so you know that the IQ level of the film is going to be pretty low (if it was a person it would just have language skills). Better than most Ferrell movies in that there actually are some laughs, but at the same time thats kind of like finding an upside to chewing on aluminum foil. Snotty comments aside I actually like the film some what. I've seen it a couple more times in pieces since its been out on DVD and I have to say that there really are some funny pieces. I still don't think that the film works as a whole but it is amusing enough to try at some point."]
