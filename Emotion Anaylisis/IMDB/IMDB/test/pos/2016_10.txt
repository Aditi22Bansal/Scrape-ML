['Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie. Great action, great acting, and some good ole arse kicking. A superhero for the modern age, black panther gives us all the vibes. The ladies keep it real, redefining what it means to be a supporting role, and taking up arms in killer action scenes. I also quite enjoy a bad guy who is relatable and toes that line. Michael B. Jordan really shines as kilmonger, he makes the movie.']
