["Adam Wingard superbly directs this dramatic blood-fest. A young, charming stranger named David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the home of the Peterson family claiming to be a friend of their late son, Caleb, killed in combat. They welcomed him with open arms, but soon things just don't seem right about him. And when a string of unexplained deaths comes to light, members of the family wonder if David even served with Caleb at all.Some of the scenes are jaw dropping and the sound helps keep your mind focused. Not a wasted moment and not a movie that has all of its ducks in a row. You can almost read David's mind before he goes into action; and yet most situations are not as predictable as you think. Blood, mayhem and suspense.Stevens is charismatic and Maika Monroe, as Anna Peterson, is very watchable. Also in the cast: Brendan Meyer, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williams and Leland Orser."]
