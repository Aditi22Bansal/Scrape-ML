["Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche."]
