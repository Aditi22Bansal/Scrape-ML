['I heard this film is good, and it certainly impressed me! The special effects are amazing. The action scenes are so fast paced that it is sometimes hard to keep track of everything that is happening. The scenes are so well made that everything looks completely real. I particularly like how the sand moves to create the sandman. Every detail is portrayed in the film! The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching! I really liked the ending. I think the final scene could have been cut away for better pacing, but maybe for some it is necessary.']
