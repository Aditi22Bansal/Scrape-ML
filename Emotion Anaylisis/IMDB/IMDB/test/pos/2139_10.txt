['it is not a comfortable film. it is not easy to understand it. not for the message or theme or script. but for the balance with strong emotions and for the force of the images from the last part. it is a film about a competition and about ballet behind the scene. but, in essence, it is portrait of social struggle who reminds vulnerabilities of its public. Natalie Portman does a surprising great job. for the wise manner to discover her character to the viewer. for the science to explore the script for a sensational image of new Faust. for the strong fight of the final scenes. for the metamorphose who is not only credible but becomes experience of the viewer. a rare film about a delicate theme who has the right director and the inspired cast.']
