['A few years ago, I went to a panel at New York ComicCon all about "The Final Girls". The movie hadn\'t yet debuted but the cast and filmmakers were there to hype the production. I enjoyed the panel but forgot to see the movie...and finally got around to it tonight. And, it turned out to be a decent little film. And, when I say \'little\' it\'s because the film was low-budgeted and seemed to come and go rather quickly. Fortunately, the DVD is available through Netflix and it\'s worth your time.Before going on, it\'s important to note that I am talking about "The Final Girls"...not "The Final Girl" from 2010.The story is about a group of five friends who inexplicably get stuck in a bad 1980s slasher film. While they know what\'s going to happen, they have a heck of a time avoiding death and only a seeming miracle can stop the killing machine, Billy.The film is a combination of comedy and pathos. I wish the film had focused more on comedy but my wife disagreed and liked the mix. Regardless, the film has many clever moments and is a nice sendoff of the genre. Worth seeing. And, it\'s one of the few films that features outtakes at the end that actually ARE worth seeing.']
