["THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) *** Elizabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Michael Dorman. Filmmaker Leigh Whannell's unique re-imagining of the classic horror film updates it with Moss as a victimized woman whose attempt to leave her abusive relationship with wealthy optics genius Jackson-Cohen results in his suicide but eventually it's known to her that, instead, he has developed a method of becoming invisible to stalk her. Moments of true tension are cunningly employed thanks to the clever cinematography of Stefan Duscio and Benjamin Wallfisch's taut score but it is truly Moss' stellar turn as Cecilia Kass who manages to walk the tightrope of sanity while proving her sustainable urgency in bettering herself."]
