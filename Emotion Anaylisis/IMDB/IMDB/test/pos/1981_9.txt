["Zach Snyder makes an overlong zombie action movie with elements of Aliens and Oceans 11.With Las Vegas infected by zombies. Billionaire casino owner Bly Tanaka (Hiroyuki Sanada) approaches mercenary Scott Ward (Dave Bautista) about a heist to recover $200 million from his casino vault before the military destroys Vegas with a tactical nuclear strike.Ward agrees with the money he will get and and recruits his former team members. Ward's estranged daughter Kate joins them as she works in a quarantine camp and is looking for someone lost inside Vegas.However Tanaka has an ulterior motive as his shifty associate also joins the team.This is a dumb action movie with fast moving zombies and even robot zombies. Some zombies are a bit more intelligent than others.There is plenty of blood splattered zombie shootouts, some of the action resembles that of game consoles.There are also plenty of flaws in the film that makes little sense. Too much chatter between characters when there is absolute urgency. A person is locked in a vault and somehow escapes.It is too long and Snyder could had easily shaved half an hour from the running time."]
