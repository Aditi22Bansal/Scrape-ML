['The supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man. But without a hero, he loses all purpose and must find new meaning to his life.Of the animated films in the last ten years, "Megamind" does not seem to get a lot of love. Which is a real shame. Because although it may be basically a Superman spoof, it is a very clever and very funny spoof. And with Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, it\'s hard to beat. (Jonah Hill could have been replaced.) Is it too late for a sequel? Because there really ought to be one, even if it seems that "Despicable Me" has the animated villain market covered.']
