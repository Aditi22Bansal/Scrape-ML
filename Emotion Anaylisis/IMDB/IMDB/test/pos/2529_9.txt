["When I was in fifth grade a little over fifty years ago, I read a Weekly Reader article that stated that most great civilizations don't last much more than two hundred years. Obviously that article made quite an impression on me because I still remember it. From the vantage point of the late 1950's this would have seemed impossible for the United States, but as we cruise well past the two hundred year mark, it almost seems inevitable now doesn't it?Believe it or not, I looked this film up because Rush Limbaugh recommended it the other day on his EIB Network radio show. I can't believe he actually watched it, but then again, benefit of the doubt and all that. It could be he was inspired by the way the picture satirizes the way the government operates today, what with a House of Representin that's about as effective as Congress these days.Well left to my own devices, this isn't the type of picture I would generally pick up, given the premise and the cast. A single viewing was enough to convince me that I've hit my quota of dumb pictures for the year, and even once is too much with this one. Indeed, human evolution may be at a turning point, and this picture only reinforces that it's direction is down hill on a slippery slope."]
