["I don't usually watch horror films. I have maybe seen three or four. I'm not talking about old Dracula or Frankenstein movies, but the current stuff. This film was so good that even a non fan like myself would enjoy it.The film was tense and action packed throughout. If you like blood, this film had it, but it wasn't gross. If you like tight suspense, then this is the film for you. It changed every second and you never knew where it would end. I'm still not sure about the ending, but I am not hopeful for the four who were left.Ving Rhames was excellent. He was supported by a great cast and each character added something of value to the film."]
