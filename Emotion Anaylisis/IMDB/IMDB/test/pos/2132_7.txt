["There are not a lot of franchises that are good from the beginning till the end but Jumanji is an exception to that rule. The quality of the movies is constant so if you liked the first or the second movie you will probably like this one as well. I always have a lot of pleasure watching any of the Jumanji movies. There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch. And even if the story is basically the same in all Jumanji movies it's still entertaining, that says enough about the quality of these movies. I'm not done with Jumanji, I could watch another one."]
