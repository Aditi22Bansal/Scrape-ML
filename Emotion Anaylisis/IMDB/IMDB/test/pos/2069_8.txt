['After the movie had played for the last time in a cinema, you could hear the cinema owners moan. The Harry Potter movies were a cash cow. Not only for the studio that produced them, but also for anyone who played them in their cinema (chain). Now it\'s over and everyone is thinking: What\'s next? While that may sound like something that may not be of interest to you, think of that: When you watch Daniel Radcliffe, do you immediately think of Harry Potter? What about the other young actors in this? It might be difficult for them to find themselves. While they all tried other things, even during the "Potter years", they became the faces of this movie franchise.Getting back to the movie. The special effects are up to date (something you should expect), the story concludes nicely (for someone who hasn\'t read the books, including myself). The acting is solid throughout. There is one scene though, that was really bad. And it involves Daniel R. and a train station. Unfortunately he can\'t convey the emotions he is going through in this pivotal scene. Other than that, you will watch it if you have seen the other movies and won\'t be disappointed']
