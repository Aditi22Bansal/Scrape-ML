['Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than "R" especially when the "siblings" are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his "sister" and "mother"! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston provide plenty of laughs as the "parental units" along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer! The whole movie was both raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters throughout. And, yes, it was funny enough for me and my friend. So on that note, I recommend We\'re the Millers.']
