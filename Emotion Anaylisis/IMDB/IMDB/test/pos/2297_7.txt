['So after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax with this eighth film.All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the wizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved characters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection. Radcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at times. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a fantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed in this film.Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes nothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when reading the book but by and large the director David Yates has constructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that these films will long live on in the memory.']
