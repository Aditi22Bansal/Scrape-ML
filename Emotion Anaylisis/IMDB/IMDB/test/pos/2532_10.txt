['A film about war, childhood, friendship, Shoah. inspired adaptation of novel by John Boyne. and little more. because the high virtue of film is its different angle to present the Shoah. and to impose not a special perspective but the most inspired.curiosity of a boy. and the war. a friendship. and the steps to discover the truth by Bruno and the emotions of viewer who knows it. it is a touching film. but, more important, useful. because it gives a honest portrait of a cruel episode. because Asa Butterfield is perfect as Bruno. and, after years, could not be a surprise. a film for understand the ash of a time. and to define for yourself essence of evil.']
