["This first section is for American readers and/or others who are prude. There is nudity in this film! I was actually shocked to see that, not because I had a problem with it, but because I never thought the movie would start this way. So if you have a problem with nudity (you shouldn't, but I know some do and that's OK), be aware of that fact! The rating should indicate the reason for it getting an R, I'm sure.Having put that out of the way, let us concentrate on the essential. You might have read about this movie and might have a picture how this is. Denzel Washington might be one of the few people who will be able to blow away those expectations. Plus the movie might not exactly go into the direction you think it will. It's really about one character and the journey he takes (no pun intended). If you can stomach it (the character can, kind of), then this will be very rewarding (hopefully)"]
