["The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Sandy Bullock) and her family.The highlight of this film is the scene with S.J. serving as Michael's manager. That is pretty humorous, even if it is probably not close to accurate. (Heck, most of the movie is probably not accurate.) I watched this to check it off as a 2010 Oscar winner. Did Bullock deserve the award? Maybe, but all she really does is talk with a bad accent. We also get an interesting story about race, racism, and stark class differences. The message is not blunt, but maybe that is clever in a way... viewers can take away the message they want to take."]
