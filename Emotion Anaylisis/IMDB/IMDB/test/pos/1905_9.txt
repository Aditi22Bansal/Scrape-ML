["It's the 1980's. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a privileged 27 year old Wall Street investment banker working for his father. He's a master of the universe type living in a pristine apartment. Jean (Chloë Sevigny) is his suffering secretary. Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) is his annoying fiancée. He's sure that she's having an affair with Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux) while he himself is having an affair with her best friend Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). On top of his materialistic vapid daily existence, he has bloodthirsty nights that gets more and more out of control.Director Mary Harron is doing a slightly surreal horror slash comedy. The major problem is that I don't really care about anybody or anything in this movie. There are some witty moments like the business card oneupmanship scene. However I just couldn't bother with the annoying boorish selfish character. At some point, the movie started to bore me. He's not funny and the movie isn't really that funny either. It's not scary as a horror. There is no tension since I don't about him or his victims. I just can't make myself care about this movie."]
