['The Devil All the Time (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Devil All the Time is a crime drama film with a talented cast ensemble that involves a dull story about religious themes. Sexual predators. And police corruption.The plot follows Willard (Bill Skarsgaard) who is a vet. Comes home and falls in love with a waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett). They have a son. Willard becoming obsessed with praying to god. And teaching his son about facing bullies and fear. While Helen (Mia Wasikowska) falls for a preacher who tries to believe that god is testing him. Years go by,Arvin (Tom Holland) and his step sister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen) who are close. She meets a shady preacher Preston (Robert Pattinson). While a corrupt officer Lee (Sebastian Stan) is trying to get reelection while trying to hide his sister Sandy (Riley Keough) and her husband Carl (Jason Clarke) behaviors. Not knowing they are picking up hitchiking guys and the husband letting them having sex with his wife.It is a slow moving dull story that feels very thin. While coming across abuse, sexual predators like priest preying on young girls. And corruption.The script narrative is also annoying that could have been done without.The cast ensemble is great though that delivered there performances. Tom Holland playing a serious role. Robert Pattinson and Jason Clarke playing very dark roles. Bill Skarsgaard doing a great job.Overall, it was a slow and dull direction crime drama. That could have been shorter. And better narrative dialogue.']
