['Not the most overwhelming thing from director Ridley Scott, but not exactly underwhelming. Commend Drew Goddard for putting Andy Weir\'s book way out there. Mark Watney (Matt Damon)is an astronaut and superior botanist that finds himself abandoned on the surface of Mars after his crew concludes that he perished in a major dust storm. Watney with his intellect and humor must find a way to survive the harsh planet.His former crew is high-tailing it back to Earth and is not told my NASA command that Watney is planting/growing potatoes and producing water for sustenance. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) is too embarrassed and ashamed at first to tell the world that the astronaut has been discovered alive by astrodynamics nerd Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) and has convinced space scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) that a rescue is very possible with some major help of international scientists, especially the Chinese space program that has the perfect rocket to get the Herculean effort underway. After being told, his original mission colleagues led by commanding officer Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) are more than ready and able to join in the rescue watched around the world.This film is held together with a soundtrack a bit better than astronaut Watney prefers. Music by the likes of Donna Summer, Abba, The O\'Jays, The Hues Corporation, David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor\'s anthem "I Will Survive".Other cast members featured: Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Mackensie Davis, Askel Hennie, Sean Bean and Kate Mara.']
