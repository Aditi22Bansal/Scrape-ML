['"The Devil All the Time" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a story of a man who is returning from the war and trying to find his place in the world through god. He starts a family with his loved one but many things will change in his life and his family\'s too.I liked this movie because it was a big surprise for me since I did not have high expectations. The plot was very interesting and it was consisted of many good scenes with much of suspense which were combined very well with drama. The interpretations of Bill Skarsg√•rd who played as Willard, Tom Holland who played as Arvin, Riley Keough who played as Sandy and Robert Pattinson who played as Reverent Preston Teagardin were simply amazing and very different from what we have already watched them play. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Jason Clarke who played as Carl and he was very good at it. Lastly, I have to say that "The Devil All the Time" is a nice movie and surprisingly good, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.']
