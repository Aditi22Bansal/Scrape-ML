["The Spiderman franchise seems to be the one that is bucking the trend with the films actually getting better each time. The dynamic between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal in this is great and now that we don't have to pretend we don't know Spidey's identity, we can develop the character much more fully so the relationship with MJ is also taking better shape too. It's fast-moving, entertaining and the plot is fun. For a change, the CGI is complementary to the production rather than the sole reason for it. Good stuff, this!!"]
