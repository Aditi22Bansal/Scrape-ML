['I firmly believe Monster House is the best animated film of 2006. I did like Happy Feet and Cars, but Monster House beats them both in my opinion. It is superbly animated, with the colours really bold and the character designs and backgrounds really interesting. I also liked the music, which further added to the atmosphere, while the story is briskly paced and smartly written. My favourite assets though are the script and characters. The characters are brilliantly written and wonderfully voiced, while the script is witty and inquisitive. Overall, I love Monster House and strongly recommend it for pretty much anybody really. 10/10 Bethany Cox']
