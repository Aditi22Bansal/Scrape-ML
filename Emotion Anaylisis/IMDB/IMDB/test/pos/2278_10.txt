['If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback. Depending on what your viewing behavior is, you\'ll either enjoy the really out there feeling of this or you won\'t. Normally I\'d think I\'m not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it\'s not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it\'s the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the "tension" high. If you\'re not sure watch the trailer, if it is appealing watch, otherwise don\'t waste your time']
