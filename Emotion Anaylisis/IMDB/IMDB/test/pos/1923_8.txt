Jackson and Cobie Smulders)\n More of the same (and then some) from the Marvel Universe in this 19th film of the accumulated series (and tenth anniversary of Marvel Studios inception) features the assembled superheroes re-aligning for the ultimate battle royale against alien Thano (Brolin) hell-bent on destroying half of all the living beings in the universe for a colossal 'reboot' of Life As We Know It. Directed with brio by the Russo Brothers (Anthony & Joe) and well- cobbled screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely manages to juggle the astronomically large cast of regulars mixing the right peppering of humor with drama, and proves to be a big game changer for its inevitable follow-up.
