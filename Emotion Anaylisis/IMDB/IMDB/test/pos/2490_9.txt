["Director Steven Soderbergh has gathered a cast of big name actors to do this scattered storyline virus movie. There is no doubt that these are brilliant actors, and Soderbergh has great skills who has done multi-storyline movies. However in this case, the people die off and we can't built any emotional attachments to the characters.Soderbergh does inject a sense of realism in this movie with the exception of the conspiracy blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law). The realism has its own sense of thrilling suspense, but none of it is memorable other than an overall sense of dread. Maybe it's a little too much matter of fact."]
