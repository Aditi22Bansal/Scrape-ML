['I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn\'t overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It\'s not "Lord Of The Rings," of course, but it\'s still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I\'ve seen now.I don\'t buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff, just enjoying the special-effects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff ("Harry"), Emma Watson ("Hermione") and Rupert Grint ("Ron") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. "Ron" squeaks half the time he talks!As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language.']
