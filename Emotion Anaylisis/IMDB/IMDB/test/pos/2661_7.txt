["Spoofs are ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder. It was fresh and innovative.What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films.You are easily brought into the atmosphere which gets regularly punctured with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle.The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth.Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends the monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy.Almost 40 years later, it is still mad and funny."]
