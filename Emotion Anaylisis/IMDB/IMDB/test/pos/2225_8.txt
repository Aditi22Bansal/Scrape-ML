['I just saw "Gone Girl" tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I\'d rate it. It\'s good...but I can\'t see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like \'journalist\', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film "Leave Her to Heaven". But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.']
