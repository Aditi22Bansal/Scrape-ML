['Remember when Ronald Colman copped an Oscar for going berserk as a Shakespearian actor in 1947\'s "A Double Life?" Natalie Portman is about to do the same as a ballerina going off the wall in "Black Swan."The ballet scene, especially the showing of Swan Lake is beautifully staged. Did anyone see the similarity between her Natalie\'s movie mother and Anne Bancroft in "The Turning Point?" Both gave up ballerina careers to pursue families. Of course, this \'Swan\' is certainly no \'Turning Point\' either.As the conflicted ballet star, Portman turns in a credible performance which will probably be honored on Oscar night, Feb. 27th.As viewers, we are ourselves conflicted. What did ballet director, an excellent Vincent Cassel, and fellow ballerina and rival, Mila Kunis both do to add to Portman\'s madness? Kunis, at the beginning of the film, acts as though she is a young tough right out of the gangs in "West Side Story." Cassel, as the driving choreographer, is excellent in the role.Portman\'s downhill descent into madness occurs too quickly. True, that Cassel wanted her to be more devilish in the twin role of the evil Black Swan. It\'s as if Portman has become the Norma Desmond of ballet. She was certainly ready for her final take, no matter how tragic that was.']
