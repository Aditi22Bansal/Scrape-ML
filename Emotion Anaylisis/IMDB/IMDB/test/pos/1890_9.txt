["Well maybe not so scary, more creepy from times to times. But only in a good way. This movie is yet another great fantasy tale from Tim Burton. And it seems, that he has special skills for fantasy tales. Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney? I don't know, could be, despite the fact he left Disney as young frustrated animator). But it's the story that will get you excited, it's very crazy and seems to be in the same vein as Edward Sciscorhands!"]
