['This film is about a family grieving for the loss of their murdered 14-year-old daughter, while the daughter observes their lives from a perfect land above."The Lovely Bones" is so beautifully made. Susie, played by Saoirse Ronan, looks like a perfectly innocent angel. She instantly connects with viewers and her tragic events evoke much sympathy. How she sees the world she left behind and how she interacts with it is so moving. I particularly find the heaven sequences moving. Everything, including trees, sea and sky looks so perfect. Maybe, through these beautiful scenes, those who have gone through the loss of their loved ones might be consoled by the thought that their loved ones have gone to such a beautiful place."The Lovely Bones" is also engagingly suspenseful. There have been so many times that I cannot help myself but shout at the characters to do or not to do something. I was very engaged and moved by "The Lovely Bones", as it has all the ingredients to be a profoundly moving and heartbreaking tale.']
