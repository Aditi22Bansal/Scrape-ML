['WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.Based on the posters and previews and such, I really thought this was going to be a war movie. And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn. Although he never turned the film into a comedy, he brought a humor to the story that really made it well-rounded and enjoyable. That was a fine bit of casting.']
