['While traveling to California for the dispute of the final race of the Piston Cup against The King and Chick Hicks, the famous Lightning McQueen accidentally damages the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. Lightning McQueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals, changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner.In the cute "Cars" the world is inhabited by automobiles and there is a great message about the meaning of friendship in the wild contemporary competitive world. The hero learns the important lesson that sometimes the true winner is not the one who simply wins the race but uses the heart and does the best. Owen Wilson is amazingly funny giving the voice to the rookie Lightning Queen and it is amazing how some intellectuals do not like this adorable animation. Or maybe they do not have understood the message of the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Carros" ("Cars")']
