['THE GREEN LANTERN (2011) *** Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Tim Robbins, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett, Tamuera Morrison (voices of: Geoffrey Rush, Michael Clarke Duncan and Clancy Brown) DC Comics\' cult superhero\'s origin story is given the big-screen treatment with better-than-expected results with cocksure Reynolds nicely cast as hot-shot test pilot Hal Jordan who is reluctantly \'chosen\' by an intergalactic police force known collectively as The Green Lanterns enlisting him to stop a soul-sucking, planet-devouring entity – Parallax (scarily voiced by Brown) – from destroying Earth. Director Martin Campbell gets out the big guns with the visual and special effects (and not too shabby in 3D either) for the popcorn crowd/fanboys while a game cast – including Strong as alien Sinestro (an uncanny resemblance to a Vulcanized John Waters!) – and particularly Reynolds doing the heavy lifting of going from callow fratboy to genuine underdog hero while Sarsgaard gets in touch with his inner John Malkovich as the villainous Hector Hammond – whose icky transformation from a close encounter has him looking like a combo of John Merrick (AKA "The Elephant Man") and John Carpenter (!) Echoes of Richard Donner\'s "SUPERMAN" (a nifty helicopter set piece) – with its blend of humor/heart – keeps the right direction for a blossoming franchise.']
