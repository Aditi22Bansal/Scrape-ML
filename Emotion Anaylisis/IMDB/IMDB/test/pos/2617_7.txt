["Depending on your cynicism-count you'll either view this as a great feel-good movie or Fantasy Island writ large. Consider: Robert de Niro is cast as the most perfect male since Jimmy Stewart in IAWL, the most lovable guy in town dispensing wisdom like ATMLs dispense tenners while Ann Hathaway is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has single-handedly built up an online fashion company from nothing to a place on the Big Board, is adored by her employees and adorable, not to say cute, small daughter and hasn't an enemy in the world. Conflict! What conflict. I've always found deNiro grossly overrated so it was Hathaway who drew me to this one and Yes, I did knowingly surrender to its charm and wallowed in its entertainment factor for the running time but that's not the same as dismissing the flaws."]
