['An up and coming writer and director, Mark Romanek, wrote and directed the 2002 film, "One Hour Photo" starring Robin Williams. Williams plays Sy, a deeply disturbed man who runs the photo development booth at a discount store. He is obsessed with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has been developing since the son, Jake, was an infant. Having no life of his own, Sy parks his car outside the Yorkin house, runs into Mrs. York at a mall food court, and makes extra copies of their photos for his wall at home. Then he discovers, through another customer\'s photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy\'s isolation in the world. The film is very well done.One quibble I have is when Sy\'s boss (Gary Cole) questions Sy about the discrepancy in prints sold versus the excessive amount of prints made by the AGFA machine. Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams\' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well. Eriq LaSalle, formerly of "E.R." plays a police detective.Without Romanek\'s fine touches, this would have been on the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Thanks to his sense of style, it isn\'t.']
