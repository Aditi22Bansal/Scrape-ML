["Interesting concept, but quickly it becomes obvious that the writer/director's concept was too clever for its own good. Many holes in the concept and plot. Plus, there is an attempt to build a moral implication and stand to a fictitious, barely-believable, concept. Quite lame.After the initial scene setting, the movie quickly degenerates into stock-standard chases and action sequences. So, quite predictable after a point.Solid enough performance from Justin Timberlake. Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy are OK. Pity Olivia Wilde only has a minor part."]
