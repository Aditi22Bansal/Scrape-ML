['Sometime in the near future, muscular "G.I. Joe" team captain Channing Tatum (as Conrad "Duke" Hauser) delivers some warheads for the military. They can eat metal, and will devour entire cities unless commanded to stop. Very cool. Also cool are "nanomites" that boil in the necks of enslaved men. Helping Mr. Tatum is muscular sidekick Marlon Wayans (as Wallace "Rip" Weems). Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Rex "The Doctor" Lewis) goes from good to bad-ass. The beautiful and sexy Sienna Miller (as Ana "The Baroness" Lewis) kicks it with the beautiful and sexy Rachel Nichols (as Shana "Scarlett" O\'Hara). There are a lot of explosions, crashes, muscles and special effects.***** G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (7/27/09) Stephen Sommers ~ Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sienna Miller, Marlon Wayans']
