["Taken is a French thriller starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen. The screenplay was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, and directed by Pierre Morel. Neeson plays a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative who sets about tracking down his daughter after she is kidnapped by human traffickers while traveling in France.He sets on a frantic quest to rescue her after the young girl is abducted by slave traders in District B13.This is film provides a lot of fun and entertainment as a predictable action thriller.It's got all the attributes of a pleasurable action thriller - excitement, some undeniably enjoyable scenes and the absence of what it needs to be more memorable and more substantial.Also,a viewer is introduced to a new side of Liam Neeson, one that is relentless and likes to hit criminals in the throat and he makes this action movie engaging.That is why this is one excellent film despite of being far from a masterpiece."]
