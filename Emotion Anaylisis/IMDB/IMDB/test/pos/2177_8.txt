['Lonely department store "One Hour Photo" guy Robin Williams (as Seymour "Sy" Parrish) lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for what seems like the perfect family: "Full frontal" father Michael Vartan (as William "Will" Yorkin), beautiful wife Connie Nielsen (as Nina Yorkin), and their cute nine-year-old son Dylan Smith (as Jakob "Jake" Yorkin). Soon, Mr. Williams is stalking the family; he watches young Smith play baseball, meets Ms. Nielsen at the Galleria food mart for lunch, and parks his car outside their home after work. When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world\'s best father, he goes "Psycho".Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams\' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples: Maya\'s pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to "unite" in the hotel room. Jake\'s perceptions about "Sy" are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent "point-of-view" shot of Williams\' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker. And, while "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a great old movie, why not substitute one that compliments "Sav-Mart", like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"? ******* One Hour Photo (1/13/02) Mark Romanek ~ Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen']
