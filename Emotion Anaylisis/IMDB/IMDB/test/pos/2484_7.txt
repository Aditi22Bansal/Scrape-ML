["Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."]
