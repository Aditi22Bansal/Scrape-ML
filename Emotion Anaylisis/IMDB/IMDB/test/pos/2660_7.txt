['I would be hard-pressed to find another comedy with a cast this good. Everyone--Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, Gene Hackman, Kenneth Mars--sparkles in their own realm of dementia here, especially Wilder, whose brand of mayhem uncorks at whim and sometimes sends us scurrying for cover! It\'s a very funny--and yet serious--spoof of the "Frankenstein" movies, with humor that derives from our nostalgia and the set replicas as much from the dialogue. The plot is (intentionally) familiar, but the script isn\'t always so predictable, throwing the audience a curve-ball now and then. The jokes range from terrific to terrible, yet the cast and director/co-writer Mel Brooks almost always manage to keep the movie on track. Wilder teamed with Brooks on the screenplay, and there was a small feud about who did most of the work; consequently, they never did another picture together. It was their loss as well as ours, for despite some OK films (Wilder\'s "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\' Smarter Brother" and Brooks\' "High Anxiety"), neither reached the heights they climbed with "Young Frankenstein". *** out of ****']
