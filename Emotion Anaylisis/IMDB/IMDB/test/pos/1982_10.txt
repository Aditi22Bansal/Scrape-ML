["When Sir Ector thoughtlessly dies before competing in a money-making jousting tournament, his squire William takes his place and turns out to be quite good at it. Unfortunately, his lack of noble birth means that he is playing a dangerous game: fortunately, a chance encounter with down-on-his luck Geoffrey Chaucer brings him a penman who can provide well-forged credentials. Accompanied by fellow squires Roland and Wat, William (now known as Sir Ulric) embarks on a career and love life, while making friends and enemies along the way.The minute the audience at the joust start clapping along with We Will Rock You, it becomes clear that A Knight's Tale is minded to cheerfully disregard any suggestion that it should be historically accurate. Indeed, it goes out of its way to pepper itself with anachronistic gags, both verbal and visual.Heath Ledger, doing an excellent English accent, delights as William, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide excellent support as his two fellow squires. Rufus Sewell is a splendid villain, while Shannyn Sossamon is a little anaemic as the love interest. But towering above everything is Paul Bettany's hilarious Geoff Chaucer.This film is hugely entertaining."]
