['If you enjoy the "Jumanji" movie franchise, then you will definitely also enjoy this 2019 addition. You know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch the movie, and writers Jake Kasdan, Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg definitely deliver as expected.There is an abundance of fast-paced action, funny characters, witty banter and dialogue, as well as a very wholeheartedly entertainment value to the movie. It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then "Jumanji: The Next Level" definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch "Jumanji: The Next Level" regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating "Jumanji: The Next Level" a six out of ten stars.']
