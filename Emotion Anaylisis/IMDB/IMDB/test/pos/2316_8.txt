['This film tells the story of a young man who is selected to be in training to work for a private run secret agent service."Kingsman: The Secret Service" is really a lot of fun. The graphic violence is so over the top that it becomes funny. The fireworks scene makes me laugh out loud! I like the characters in the film, I think Colin Firth is very convincing as a gentleman and secret agent. His protégé is good as well, he transforms from a street kid to a gentleman with killer instincts. The numerous action scenes are very imaginative, they even have balloons going up into space, which is quite unexpected. I enjoyed watching this film.']
