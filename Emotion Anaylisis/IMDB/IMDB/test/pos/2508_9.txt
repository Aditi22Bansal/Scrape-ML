['This film is about the life a big time thief after robbing a bank. He dates one of the victims in the robbery, while the FBI is on the hunt for him."The Town" is not a conventional action thriller, as it has an actual plot. So many action thriller nowadays involve mindless violence and senseless explosions, but "The Town" has none of these problems. It has well developed emotional elements in the background of action. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is well portrayed and developed. It is interesting to see how their relationship is tested when the truth comes out, and it is satisfying to see how their relationship end up to be in the end.I find the middle parts of the film a little slow, but the ending parts make up for it. "The Town" is a reasonably entertaining movie, but I feel a little undecided on whether I liked it.']
