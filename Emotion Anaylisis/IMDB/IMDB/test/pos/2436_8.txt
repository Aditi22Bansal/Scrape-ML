['Ridley Scott is famous for bringing "Alien" and "Bladerunner" to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with "The Martian" he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it\'s hard to believe it\'s from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it\'s a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies!As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I\'ll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that\'s something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it\'s THAT good!']
