["I only have read the first book of the Hunger Games, but seen both movies. The first movie had to be restrained and was compared to a Japanese movie (not without a reason). While this seems a bit like a rehash of the same, it is way better in execution. It's still a bit too long and has some issues, but the comedy bits do work in its favor and there seems to be a switch in pace.Twists aside (which should actually be apparent), most will be looking forward to the conclusion with the third book getting released too. Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) the third book will be getting the split movie treatment. Until then (and lets hope it won't be the same again, because they will get out of options with doing it again ... and again), enjoy this and Jennifer Lawrence in it."]
