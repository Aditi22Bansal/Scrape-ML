['Yeah, I\'m not going to lie: my inner 12 year-old loves this movie. Or at least parts of it. Whenever Will Ferrell and John C Reilly are at war, it sends me into a fit of giggles - and totally feels like they\'d ad-libbed half this stuff. It\'s when these scenes are awkwardly melded into the overall family story that the humor starts to go flat; despite the cast involved. That said, Rob Riggle steals every one of his scenes. And Reilly\'s random "Boats and hoes!" outbursts has been in my head for ten years now. It\'s so lovably dumb.']
