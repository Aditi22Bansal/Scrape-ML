Obviously, providing hours of mental clutter-induced deep sleep is one of the Disney Mega-Corp\'s main goals in latching on to Marvel Studios. Soon Disney will merge the X-MEN and the AVENGERS into one film, guaranteed to send sleep-deprived members of Big Families or those with apartments next to the El into an elusive snooze after the first 20 minutes of endless "super hero" introductions involving the exchange of birth names, Noms De Guerre, aliases, and "pet" monikers.
