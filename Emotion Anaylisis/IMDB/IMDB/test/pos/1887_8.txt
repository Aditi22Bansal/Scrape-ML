['a return. to the rules of classic horror. the comeback of tension and authenticity and role of acting as more than ingredient of screams. Conjuring has a solid story . and this is used in wise, subtle, credible manner. the fight against evil has new form and flesh. the ambiguity becomes more important than the shadows of blood. the tragedy of a family has not only impressive but so realistic than impose to the viewer a strange old emotion - to be part of the story. sure, Conjuring is not the only example of return to classic horror model from the last decade. but it is one of great films who reminds the basic purpose of cinema. to convince. to give force and substance and to convince the public. not a show. but a real good story. this does it a remarkable work.']
