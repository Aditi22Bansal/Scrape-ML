["Straight forward and tense chiller; Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and children are forced into a new way of life. The Abbott family will face the major struggle of going about life in silence in order to survive in a post apocalyptic world, where blind monstrous creatures use highly sensitive hearing to stalk out prey...human prey. Horror and tension will rapidly mount as the monsters are alarmed. By the way, one of the Abbott children was born deaf and Evelyn grows weary knowing she is expecting. How do you keep a new born baby quiet? Needlessly to say, this movie is rather silent. And you will jump from your seat a couple of times...and not for refreshments. The creatures don't really have a lot of screen time, but be assured they are scary looking. Krasinski not only stars, but directs and shares in the writing the screenplay. Ms. Blunt will gradually grab your concern. Millicent Simmonds, is an actual deaf actress that plays the non-hearing child; and is outstanding. A QUIET PLACE lives up to the hype!"]
