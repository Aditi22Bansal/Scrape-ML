['THOR: RAGNAROK (2017) ***1/2 Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Hopkins, Benedict Bumbercatch, Taika Waititi, Luke Hemsworth, Sam Neill, (Voice of Clancy Brown) (Cameo: Stan Lee) Fun and fast-paced Marvel Universe thread with Thor facing down his long-lost, yet beyond evil, sister Hela (formidable Blanchett) in her hell-bent vengeance seeking and destroying their home planet of Asgard while being imprisoned as a reluctant gladiator versus of all people/things - Dr. Bruce Banner, The Incredible Hulk. Director Waititi (who co-stars in motion capture CGI as an alien compadre) shrewdly turns the hero upside down and smartly relying on much needed humor and light-hearted endeavors layering the dark proceedings at hand. Laced with biting wit thanks to a well-tempered screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost allowing Hemsworth to stretch his comedic skills (deadpan lethal and with aplomb) while also allowing secondary (and new) characters to shine including Hiddleston as the arch half-brother Loki up to his usual antics and back stabbings (but less lethal this time) and a truly hilarious interplay ala Hope and Crosby with Ruffalo as an equally unruffled Banner trying to keep up with the plot. Enjoy!']
