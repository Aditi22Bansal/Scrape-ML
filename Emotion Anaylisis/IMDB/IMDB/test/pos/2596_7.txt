['This film is about a secret rescue mission by the CIA to save six American embassy staff in Iran."Argo" is a well made thriller. The first half sets the scene for the dangerous mission, and it does so in an almost comedic style. The CIA has to choose the most unlikely and ridiculous cover for their mission, and it is so non-thriller like that it makes "Argo" almost like a spoof comedy. The second half is a real roller coaster ride, especially the critical scenes where there is only a fine line between life and death. The scenes are very well done, with so much tension and suspense that I was on the edge throughout the process. I liked "Argo", and I can see it having crossover appeal to non thriller fans.']
