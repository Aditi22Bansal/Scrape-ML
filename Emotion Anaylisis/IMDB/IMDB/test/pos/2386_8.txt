["It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel Verdú. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal. It's like a fairy tale fantasy got mixed up with a horror movie."]
