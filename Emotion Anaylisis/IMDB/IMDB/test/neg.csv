"'This film very closely follows the plot of the original classic. An all American family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere (New Mexico desert here) and are attacked by a family ravaged by nuclear radiation.I\'m no fan of the first one. I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it\'s really happening can get to you. It didn\'t scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It\'s surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It\'s not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one. Otherwise--stay away. I give it a 5.'"
"'In the first place, I consider it a blasphemy to remake a Wes Craven movie, even one as disgusting as The Hills Have Eyes. In the second place, the idea of nuclear tests turning people into bloodthirsty mutants - had they used it in the \'70s - could have been one of the many movies involving fear of the government (along with The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, All the President\'s Men and Capricorn One).So, they not only remade a Wes Craven movie, but they used it as an excuse to show gratuitous violence. I usually really like slasher movies, but I found nothing entertaining about this one. It was just plain gross. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levine should have known better than this. Avoid it.As for anything about nuclear tests and their effects, just watch The Atomic Cafe.'"
"I'm a bit dissapointed: couldn't they get Mila Kunis too to complete the holy trinity? You know, Rachel Bilson, Kristen Stewart and her ... everyone is calling them that, right? No? Ok kidding aside and back to the movie though (especially because Kristen does not really have a big part here ... not that Rachel Bilson is doing much either, just saying): this is a light and entertaining affair if you suspend your disbelief with more than a stellar cast.If you can get Samuel L. Jackson to play any part in your movie ... I'd say you are good. Doug Liman directing also helps a lot. So while I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece and full of cliches and odd character traits and choices ... you can put all those aside and just enjoy the movie ... it is possible! Just do it - otherwise it is probably better not to watch the movie at all (effects have aged quite good by the way all things considering)"
"'This film tells the story of Deadpool who has to find his heart should be at, in order to get through to the woman he loves.The film does make me giggle quite a few times, especially the parachute scene which has one joke after another. It is a film that cannot be taken seriously, even though the ending tries to make it look like a film with some substance. It is more for a brainless laugh, than for an adrenaline fuelled adventure.'"
"'This is a well-acted horror sequel. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy add some names and class to the gig. Steven King had a minor role as a storekeeper. As in most films, it sticks to the book in some cases while it deviates in others. The special horror effects were excellent. There were too many characters to get emotionally connected to their personal drama, although they made an effort to try as they gathered their tokens.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
This takes place in the 1920s. Nick Carraway (Toby Maguire) narrates it from a sanitarium. It's about Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is VERY wealthy and his obsession with Daisy (Carey Mulligan). The problem is she's married to someone else.The novel is great but this movie completely trashes it. It makes ill-conceived changes in the story and goes on far too long. Also it's WAY overdone. There are endless parties at Gatsby's mansion and they're shoved in your face nonstop. A few times I had to close my eyes because there was too much going on! I saw it in 2D--in 3D it must be impossible to watch. When it isn't in your face it's deadly dull and moves at a snails pace. To make matters worse Maguire is lousy. Totally blank-faced in his role. Mulligan (who can be good) was even worse! I never got a grasp on her character or motivations. On the other hand DiCaprio was great as Gatsby. He's grown into an amazing actor. Very good-looking too. But this movie is mostly concerned with visuals--not the story. It manages the impossible--it's boring and overdone at the same time! Read the book instead.
"'I preferred this version slightly over the \'73 version although it too was great. Reasons why I preferred this was in the acting (newer slightly w/Malek & Hunnam over the prestigious McQueen & Hoffman); the locations (newest: Serbia, Malta, Montenegro over the older Hawaii, Jamaica, Spain) & definitely sets, props, costumes in the newer.\nSupposedly, Papillon the tale is at best 75% true with a large part being an aggregate of other inmates experiences. According to French records he was not imprisoned on Devil\'s Island which incidentally has nice slopping beaches; not cliffs. What was surprising to me was that this small boat made it via wind/currents from French Guiana along hundreds of miles of Atlantic ocean to the northern tip of S.A. & Colombia, and not ending up in mid-Atlantic. Supposedly CharriÃ¨re Papillon (butterfly in french of which he carried a tattoo) tried several times to escape in his 11+ years of incarceration (imprisoned in 1933 released in 1945); spent most of his subsequent life in Venezuela; book published in 1969; died in 1973.'"
"They did a remake of the incredible story of Henri Charriere Papillon. Why? I don't know. It was clearly not as good as the first one which may have had some Hollywood dramatization. This film appeared to be more gritty and realistic but knowing the ending made it anti-climatic. Not a bad production, just not as good. Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Nudity."

"I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more."
"'When the daughter of the governor of a Caribbean island, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), is proposed by Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport), she faints, fells into the sea and is rescued and saved by the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) but he is arrested and sentenced to death for piracy. Meanwhile, the town is attacked by the ship Black Pearl, commanded by the former first mate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), who leaded a mutiny against Captain Jack Sparrow years ago. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth, and the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who loves her, releases Jack Sparrow and they steal the fastest vessel of the navy to follow the Black Pearl, Will trying to save Elizabeth, and Jack trying to retrieve his ship. Along their journey, many secrets are disclosed about the course of the Black Pearl and her crew.The supernatural adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Barbossa are so spectacular that really deserves to be included among the best movies (Top 250) in IMDb. This film has action, humor, romance, mystery, special effects and is so delightful that the viewer does not feel the running time of 143 minutes. I saw this movie for the first time on 24 April 2004, and I have just watched again today (10 Feb 2007) enjoying the same way as in the first time. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Piratas do Caribe Â A MaldiÃ§Ã£o do PÃ©rola Negra (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl)'"
"'This was a fine but not spectacular Superman film, boosted by having Amy Adams involved.'"
"'For a movie that didn\'t make a whole lot of sense on a scientific level, I thought it was fairly entertaining. You just have to suspend disbelief at appropriate times, like when Millburn (Rafe Spall) tried to make nice with the cobra looking thingy, or when Shaw had her abdomen mechanically stapled and was good to go following her aliendectomy. I have to admit though, the whole concept of discovering where humanity got it\'s start left me in the dust; very confusing and not credible in the least. The alien/human DNA match was one of those one in a quadrillion shots that didn\'t pass muster with this viewer. I wasn\'t aware of this movie when it first came out, and ordered it up when I read it had something to do with the Alien franchise. So that\'s where my attention was focused the entire time, and wouldn\'t you know it, that didn\'t occur until the very end of the picture. In my case it was worth waiting for, because even if most of the story wasn\'t very credible, it still provided some cool special effects and those surreal scenes of David\'s (Michael Fassbender) disembodied head talking to Shaw. Almost as good as the first time it was done with Ian Holm in the role of Ash in the original Alien. Hard to believe that film is almost forty years old as I write this.'"
"'In Los Angeles, the wealthy owner of an art gallery Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) has a loveless marriage with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who is cheating on her. Out of the blue, she receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) entitled Nocturne Animals and dedicated to her. They have been divorced for nineteen years and now Edward is asking for her opinion. The novel is about a man called Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is traveling on vacation by car with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) through a lonely road. Out of the blue, a car bumps their car and throws them off the-road. The troublemakers Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Turk (Robert Aramayo) abduct Laura and India while Lou (Karl Glusman) dumps Tony in an isolated road. Tony walks to the police station and ranger Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) finds Laura and India raped and murdered. Meanwhile Susan recalls her relationship with Edward and rekindles her love for him. Nocturnal Animals is a deceptive movie by Tom Ford. The overrated IMDb rating associated to the names of Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal increases the deception of any viewer. Tony Hastings is a weak and unlikable character. The two segments are poorly resolved and the conclusion of each segment is awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Animais Noturnos (Nocturnal Animals)'"
"'The fact that is quirky, with just female leads and female writer and director, is the reason why the film is fun. If you would try to gender-swap it, you would get Batman and Robin without the one-liners. It makes little sense, though. From the beginning to start it is one action fest of ass kicking, but no characters that one can care about, no strategy, almost no story. Ewan McGregor\'s villain is weak and the classic cardboard psycho, so the tension is not really there. His henchman gets more screen time and is more interesting. The main character is Harley Quinn, with the birds of prey as secondary characters that only show their worth at the very end and frankly have little bearing on the story until then. But I would argue that what made the film more fun was Ella Jay Basco\'s unapologetic little pocket thief character.Bottom line: when the laws of physics are broken, men fall from a kick from a girl and girls get up and fight after being hit by a car and thrown into another. The film is guilty pleasure fun, but makes little sense overall.'"

"'It would seem strange for me to like a pleasant summer comedy, but I think this one is actually watchable and even gives laughs sometimes.  It is John Grisham meets um, should I say Clueless?  A ditzey yet very smart college girl gets dumped by her boyfriend, and figures out that if she becomes a law student and perhaps even a laywer, she might win him back (even after she realizes he\'s engaged).  Clumsy at times and of course cliched (aren\'t they all nowadays), but also fun in a brainless dead-zone way. B'"
"'This film tells the story of a man in the 1820\'s, who sets out with a group of men for a fur trading expedition. He is attacked by a bear, then left for dead by his men. After he witnessed his son being killed, he sets on a long journey to live for revenge.There is so much buzz around The Revenant so I had high hopes for it. However, I was thoroughly disappointed after just ten minutes. It is excessively violent and graphically gory. I think there is no need for ten minutes of fighting and five minutes of bear attack, when one minute each is already enough to convey the message. Most scenes drag on and on, what could have been told in ten seconds are often dragged to minutes long.Another thing that I dislike is the fact that all actors have long unkempt hair, covering most of their faces. This makes character recognition an intense mental challenge! Thirdly, the story is not engaging or interesting. It only involves Leonardo walking around in snow most of the time. There is nothing to captivate me. I watched the whole 2.5 hours of The Revenant, and I was thoroughly bored.'"
"What was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film?The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage, killing off many of the traders.Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for this film? He gave many other much better performances in other films. The choice was ridiculous.The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting performance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by way of religion.This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio could ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina needed to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim.Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire film."
"'We are constantly being reminded that we can\'t understand movies if we are not into cgi (computer generated images). Well, that doesn\'t work for me. That\'s like saying a black light Elvis picture is true art because I don\'t appreciate black felt. Movies are good because they have a story to tell, not because they are endless eye candy. The convoluted nature of this film, taking every random horror element possible, just doesn\'t work. This is too bad. I think Hugh Jackman is a really charismatic actor. It\'s just that they throw so much against the wall to see what sticks. Maybe if, like video games, the movie came with a manual, explaining the rules that each character can play by, it would be helpful. Some can die; oops, I guess they can\'t. Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi\'s Dracula and tell him off. There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing! Dracula says. Maybe this movie is one of them.'"
"'Jojo Rabbit (Roman Griffin Davis) is part of the Trump Youth Group. He is a ten-year-old boy who likes to dress up, be part of the club and play Nazi. Hitler (Taika Waititi) is his imaginary friend. As the war closes in on Berlin, he discovers a Jew (Thomasin McKenzie) hidden in the closet. His mother (Scarlett Johansson) is part of the resistance.The film depicts the Germans in a comic fashion similar to Hogan\'s Heroes. In spite of the dark background, the film is mostly light. Sam Rockwell gives us a comical performance.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.'"
"Baby is a young man (Ansel Elgort) who is tantamount to a stunt car driver, though he's not a pro. He works for a criminal (Kevin Spacey) as a wheelman after robberies as a way to pay him back for stealing from him some years earlier. He hides the money he makes in the floorboards of the apartment he shares with his foster father (C.J. Jones), who is deaf and in a wheelchair. The two sign to one another. That's good, because Baby doesn't talk much. He spends all tie listening to music via his earbuds - he has tinnitus from a childhood accident that killed his parents.Baby meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James) and falls for her - she doesn't know what he does. And the latest robbery involves some violent and very nasty characters (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez). And that puts Baby, Joseph, and Debora in danger.Really excellent film with unbelievable car chases. Elgort has great moves as he dances around listening to his tunes. He underplays, but his feelings read in his face. The rest of the acting is excellent; Spacey and his gang are mean as dirt. Highly recommended."
"A remake of Wes Craven's 1972 movie. Fairly good, and better than the original.The director builds the scenario and tension well and doesn't overdo the horror clichÃ©s. Convincing acting by a cast of unknowns.The original was pretty much your standard 1970s B-grade exploitation thriller, complete with low production values and hammy acting. This version, on the other hand, is much slicker and has decent performances."
"'When the viewer watches any 007 franchise, he or she knows what is going to see: an entertaining full of action adventure, with beautiful women, car chase, conspiracy, great villains, predictable story and a brainless screenplay.

"Time to retire this franchise.Big budget boredom - 007 is like Ol' Man River - he just keeps rolling along, but in the case of 007, this franchise has had it. My advice: After the first truly electrifying 13 minutes, turn this off and keep your happy memories. In this one, Bond goes rogue after receiving a message from the beyond, in a way. He infiltrates a secret meeting and learns about the evil group SPECTRE. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there's a new M (Ralph Fiennes) and a merger with MI5 and a decision to kill the Double O program. Might be a good idea, in fact.Madeleine Swan (Lea Seydoux), the daughter of an old enemy, may have the clue to finishing off SPECTRE. A good cast includes, besides Craig, Fiennes, and Seydoux, Christopher Waltz as the head of SPECTRE and Sherlock's Moriarity on PBS, Andrew Scott, one of the best of the new crop of British actors.But all that doesn't help the script. That great budget and no one can write an exciting story. Car chases, sex with women Bond met 2 minutes ago, cartoon villains, torture - it's all there in small enough doses to make the 2-1/2 hours go by like the original Birth of a Nation. I've seen Craig on stage twice - he's wasted here. About as exciting as flipping channels with a remote."

"'This film is about James Bond cracking down a multi-national corporation that works with dictators to get a share of precious natural resources.Quantum Of Solace has an impressive opening sequence. It has high speed car chases with lots of collision and gunshots. The ultra short scenes (all under one second each) and the shaky camera gives urgency and thrill, but it is so hard to actually work out what is happening.There is a lot of action and adrenaline in the film, but the plot seems not to have a focus. Nor does it make sense either, as it feels like an all-action-no-information film. All Bond does is to run around the globe after his target, and viewers are left to wonder how he made it. I don\'t find myself caring for the plot or the characters. I don\'t know why this happens, but something is not right with the film and I don\'t know what.'"
"'After the Bond begins movie with Daniel Craig (also known as Casino Royal), I came to terms into where Bond was moving to. And watching Jason Bon... ah sorry I mean James Bourne of course. No, but seriously, after many years, where Bond was the one that got copied, Bond now tries to stay in touch with the times and went air-bo(u)rne (pun intended).You can hold it against this movie, as well as the fact, that Bond never get\'s to say his name on-screen (Bond. James Bond), but does that really matter? For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn\'t much of a plot here ... it\'s a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that. I did like the movie, because I got my head around one thing ... to rephrase a quote: Bond is dead, long live the (new) Bond! I\'m not that excited about the whole thing yet, but maybe after the third one, I will be! And a movie that get\'s that much attention and get\'s discussed and even taken apart by some, has to have something going for it.'"
"'The first 80-90% of Interstellar I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn\'t make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It\'s sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful Gravity, it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it\'s a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.'"

"'A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed The Zodiac is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who\'s employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper\'s reporting of (and the police department\'s concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith\'s non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it\'s quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****'"
"I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine."
Overall I can see why this movie got bad reviews and wasn't a hit. The story is more painful and unpleasant than entertaining. The characters are not interesting and you don't feel for any of them especially Ginnifer's character who isn't very endearing. She falls in love with her best friend's fiancÃ© - what's to like? It is a waste of a good cast. Colin isn't that hot that he is so out of Ginnifer's league. Kate's character is slightly irritating. And John's is just plain lame. The missed opportunity is a bit of a silly thing to be a central story line. Don't bother with this one even if you are a fan of the actors - it's just a silly story about nothing much. It's a movie that didn't have to be made.
"Only one way the bad guys can win and that's getting Luke cage alone to punch a wall. The heroes idea , I'm like cage and I'll stop this myself, but like your the only way they can win, let hide you and figure this out. Nope I'll do this myself, only way bad guys can win is if you punch this wall. Bad guy stands in front of wall and dodges Luke punch and evil escaped. So stupid."
"I gave it a 5 for the lovely costumes. Octavia was great,as usual, but Tiffany\nis NOT a serious actress, STOP trying to make her be! Incidentally C.J. was Walker's 3rd husband this series totally negated that fact."
"'So sad to squander an opportunity like this to make an important film about black history. I kind of knew from the outset that this was likely a hot mess -- two directors, 4 writers, no mention of a costume designer, an actress playing the daughter of another actress who is only 7 years younger and it looks like it too -- these are signs of trouble... and nobody looks happy about being in the film, including Octavia. This film is plain awful. I watched half of the first episode before I began skipping through the rest to watch scenes, but it never got better.'"
'Really average scores on all the episodes for an average of 4.75 rounded to 5 overall.Just nothing really exceptional about it. I guess if you like mediocrity you can spend your time.'
"After 2 episodes It's time to call it quits. Preposterous happenings in a poorly produced show makes a mockery of a thriller or mystery. Once again we've got a situation where a book, however good it may be, is spoiled by amateurish acting and bad directing."
"Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy (Kate Hudson) are life long friends. Dex (Colin Egglesfield) was Rachel's college friend when Darcy budded in. Now Darcy and Dex are about to get married. But Rachel still has feelings for Dex and they sleep together.This movie has 2 problems and 1 great positive.Colin Egglesfield is a horribly bland lead. It's unbelievable that two great girls are battling over him. John Krasinski is an infinitely better lead. There are countless others that would be a vast improvement. Although Krasinski and Ashley Williams have some funny jokes.Second problem is that Rachel jumped into bed with Dex so early. It puts her in a moral deficit right off the bat. It makes rooting for her next to impossible.The one great positive is Ginnifer Goodwin. She pulls off the impossible by being such a sweetheart. I can't help but root for her no matter what. I don't think the movie people actually questioned the premise. At least, they could have given GG the moral high grounds."
"'The Haunting of Blay Manor (2020) was recently released on Netflix and was the followup to The Haunting on Hill House (2018). The storyline focused on an American teacher and nanny who interviews and receives a nanny job in the English countryside of two children who have had a tragic life. As she moves in she starts seeing weird things happening all around her and the children. The series tells us the story of Bly House as the nanny experiences it and has subplots around the children and nanny\'s past. Mike Flanagan is the writer of Bly House. He also wrote The Haunting of Hill House and Gerald\'s Games for Netflix and he wrote the screenplay for Doctor Sleep as well. I think the concept for this series tried to take the family element that worked so well in Hill House, switch the concept from a family to a love story, and deliver a deep ghost story to wow audiences again...it didn\'t work. This was painful to get through. There were hardly any horror elements and this was really just a series of several love stories woven together. This was very disappointing. I may only give this series one more chance. If the next season is this bad we will take a serious hiatus from this franchise. I\'d give this a 3/10.'"
"'The production and casting were superb. Immense care had gone into getting period details right, such as covering up the crosses in the churchyard (a Victorian innovation apparently). We were all therefore ready to suspend disbelief and enter Regency England once more. In their spare time they probably could have done another excellent, though unnecessary, adaptation of the book, but all the effort and budget went into another enterprise instead.The problem came in maintaining our disbelief once Amanda Price had been inserted. Only quite small disturbances would have been needed to put the original plot off course. Instead, Miss Price charged about, constantly putting her foot in it, which I often found it too toe-curling. If Tourette\'s syndrome had been recognised at that time, she might have been carted off to the local quack.However one should not take the series too seriously. It was amusing and made a fair attempt at answering the questions: what would it have been like to have been dropped into that period, and how would people of that time have reacted to someone with our views? The notable omission is that we could not have avoided the lower strata of society and there our 21st century senses and sensibilities would really have come to the boil.'"
"'Granted, the book in this case was not much better. This movie just did not have the best scenes from the book, it tacked on an ending that was just a bit to happy, and it was horribly miscast as when I read the book the pictures of the characters I got in no way resembled what we got here. Sometimes they get it near perfect, here they were off by a whole lot. The story is basically taken from Invasion of the Body Snatchers with some Stephen King twists and perversions added to the mix, the book has the perversions, the movie takes all that kind of stuff out. In the end the movie is a dried husk of the book which was not particularly strong either. Jimmy Smits is awful in it, but then so is everyone else, and the fact it is a two parter and extended needlessly does not help matters out either. So all I can say is be prepared to see a lot of green light, a very toned down ending (granted I can see why they could not do the whole woman being naked at the end), and also be prepared for a very unmemorable ride. I would suggest reading the book instead, but it is not really all that worth finding either.'"
"I did not know who Aaron Hernandez was or what he did before watching this mini-series. I can't possibly understand the position he continuously put himself with all he had around him was success, money, a happy family. Easier said than done I know but it is truly surprising how such a young comes from nothing, wins everything and loses everything. It was helpful to understand the story and the events but I was hoping to see more like Making a Murderer type of thing. Maybe that's why it was just ok. If you already know the story, it wouldn't probably had anything new to your knowledge."
"I really shouldn't review since I only watched about 45 min but , Michael Shannon. Good god! I turned it off because of him! His accent was horrific. He was all Israelis , Israelis but sounded like Idk maybe a bad German, British accent. I couldn't take him anymore. He ruined it for me because I couldn't focus on anything because of him. It was slow and I didn't give it much of a go but get an actual non American . Since it was no problem with other characters I don't know why the cast Shannon and now I'll never know of this was a decent series...."
"'Phillip Dick liked the adaptation of Blade Runner (1982) because it depicted a dark apocalyptic universe, and Minority Report (2003) carried this through with world washed out (by an iodide film process used in other movies, like Pitch Black (2000))when futures were depicted.There\'s s some of that here, but the world is far too bright to be meaningful. And the plots? How much just in time can we stand week after week, it will be the same old story unless they can figure some defining arc that gathers interest.Otherwise, this series will last about three episodes before biting the dust. Which would be a shame.'"
"'No, I had not read Le CarreÂ´s novel and not seen the film (personally, as to thrillers, I tend not to compare but try to enjoy the course of events without knowing the next stages and solutions), but I was intrigued by the era, plot and some actors (Michael Shannon and Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd). The two gentlemen were good as always, but the depiction seemed protracted (perhaps 4 episodes would have been enough?) and it lacked succulence, with brickle transition points... Moreover, I was not too keen on Florence Pugh, she did not excite my interest to find out where else she has performed.All in all, not a bad stuff, but I could mention dozens of BBC miniseries that are catchier for me. But admirers of the 1980ies, Shannon and Al. SkarsgÃ¥rd would not be disappointed.'"
"This show is just wild from the start to the finish. Home zoo owners from across the country are interviewed about their stories, and it's just indescribable the weirdness they get up too. The show itself has a lot of material since Joe Exotic films every aspect of his life. The first few episodes are crazy, and good, and then the show tries to get serious and it losses some charm. With Joe's conviction, the interviews are haphazard and there's no coverage of the trial, making the last episodes feel amateurish."
I watched a few episodes. I couldn't watch any more because I could feel the bile rising to my throat.\nAll the while my thoughts were 'this must be what southern baptist are like'.Watch the interview with Rick Kirkham for behind the scenes stories. Then you will understand my statement above.As for stars - none! IMDB should be offering minus stars.
"This is one of the craziest stories I have ever heard of, like this went from animal abuse to ridicilous personal drama in which animals were irrelevant. All the characters are unlikeable, the story is so stretched (like episode 3 should've been 15 minutes long) and some facts weren't brought to light (this series barely touches animal abuse subject). Joe Exotic might be entertaining but he ain't better than any of other characters in this documentary but I guess he would a better president than Trump."
"'strange situation. because each adaptation of Bible books is a courageous and not really inspired idea. it is not a single Christian Church and it is not a single way to live Christian faith. each adaptation is a challenge. and , in same measure, a dangerous exercise. this mini-series is special- common case. it is special for its ambition to say all story with poor instruments. it is common because this is ordinary manner of Protestant cults to promote its vision. it is a condensed version, maybe, too condensed in few parts. the acting, in many cases, is formal. and the impression is to watch a run to Jesus story, to discover episodes as flashes, good for the viewer who desires remember his basic religion knowledge but not for attract members of others religions. it is not a documentary - drama, it is not an artistic film, it is not bad or good, inspired or boring. it is only a decent mini-series. nothing more. is it enough ? maybe, as instrument for memory or for re-read the Holy Book.'"
"'it has the gift to become a personal story. because it is a film about dreams, about past, about memories who could stop or rule the present. in same measure, it is an ambitious project. maybe to ambitious because the story becomes a huge map in which plains and seas are mixed. not the last, it is one of demonstration of the art of Leonardo diCaprio. beautiful, precise but, maybe, too obvious. the original theme - the mind control - becomes an unlimited labyrinth. a story about spies becomes a psychological one. all in a oppressive rhythm, with explanations who are status of parts of lesson, with different levels who transforms it in a kind of video game. but its virtue is to be perfect choice for different viewers. and this does it great.'"
"I din't know this bad story and it left me partly shocked. Sure the most strange and disturbing (failed) bank robbery of all times.The story covers many years and I have to give Kudos to the production for prsuing the story and its developments till the (maybe) end.I have only two reservations about the conclusion:1) The story ends telling us that the master mind of all this was Marjorie, but this is based only on the confessions of two of the four men involved in the main crime (the other two died before the discover of the facts), men that have all the interest to paint a scene of this colour. Surely she was present ma depicting her as the only and main force behind the planning, while there was his friend William Rothstein that often seems to have been in charge to do pseudo-clever mad machinations, seems a little far fetched to me.2) Brian Wells during the robbery seems very calm, too calm for one that had a ticking bomb attached to his neck. At one point we are given the information that while exiting the bank he did a Charlot-like walk like he was kidding. Is not this strange? Maybe he didn't know that the bomb on his chest was real?"
"Even if you don't mind the obvious socio-political agenda of the storyline, this series is low on compelling story and high on fluff. 95% of the first episode is run-of-the-mill back story that could have been summed up in a few minutes or borrowed from a hundred other teenage love stories.The story is told as flashbacks, intercut with present day, and honestly the whole 6 episodes could have been 2 or 3 episodes with all the useless fluff removed."
"'In this Viking noir we have a contrived situation where leaver-student Maya is a mistaken accomplice of a classroom mass shooting, tension wrought solely by Maya being in the wrong place, at wrong time, with wrong people. What sort of civilized judiciary of would allow a bells-and-whistles trial of a teen on such flimsy evidence? A State Prosecution proceeding on so many counts - conspiracy, plus all THREE counts of murder? ABSURD. Counsels for defense and prosecution would have surely struck some sort of lesser-charge deal here. Unsuitably researched to say the least. A ridiculous situation.'"
"This series moves slower than usual. Each episode seems to follow people around as they pick up shoes, articles of clothing, food etc in a slow and deliberate manner. The dialog seems stilted (I used the subtitles option) but that made no difference. Common to many Swedish productions, this one has a lot of non-verbal moments where the actors just stare into space, and the camera hones in on their eyes, mouth, or other part of the anatomy. There is just too much padding to drag the series out when the story could have been done in just 4 episodes. The only different thing about this series was that the usual 10 Swedish actors who appear in most of the Swedish productions were not recycled in this one.Common to most of the Swedish productions the plot includes some holes, and illogical as they may be, it's an effort to ensure a satisfactory ending where everyone is happy with the outcome, and no one is offended."
"At what point does a film become too complicated for its own good? In the case of Inception, almost immediately: in a bid to make the ultimate 'mind-f**k' movie, writer/director Christopher Nolan starts his film at 'bloody confusing' and, over the course of 148 excruciatingly drawn-out minutes, works his way up to 'completely and utterly unfathomable' before leaving the film on a predictably ambiguous note (thus allowing endless discussion on movie forums).Along the way, Nolan introduces many an intriguing idea, but the ones that haven't been nicked from far better movies (eXistenZ, Vanilla Sky, The Matrix, Dark City, Cypher) are so half-baked that the film inevitably becomes a frustrating mess of contradiction and contrivance which conjures up an endless stream of questions (see IMDb's FAQs), none of which seem to have any satisfying answers (despite the best efforts of Nolan's rabid fan-boys).Lost in Inception's labyrinthine plot, all I could do was sit back and marvel at the special effectsâwhich are undeniably impressiveâwhilst asking myself repeatedly how Ariadne (Ellen Page) became such a great architect despite no actual work experience, and whether such a pretty young woman would really be happy to be sedated in a grubby warehouse by a group of suspicious looking strangers. Somehow, I doubt it.5 out of 10 for its jaw-dropping effects (in particular, the awesome gravity-defying fight scene), and I reckon that's being generous."
"'An obscure and unknown Israeli lawyer with no much root conscience it seems, looking to make a name and if possible more for himself, a US lawyer after sort of the same endeavour, demonstrate among other things that time will cluster justice.\nAfter so many years guilty or not guilty is pure conjecture, and everyone guess. I can say how I feel, yeah ok he was that monster, but does it make it true, sadly probably not.\nWhat about those who were convinced that claimed and fought hard for his innocence, does it make it true? no\nI think it\'s a great series also that voluntarily or not, has created a deep and fragmented dilema about the meaning of justice, and opened a debate on free will.'"
"'Because of my age, I guess, I had no idea what the outcome of the court\'s decision would be. I hadn\'t even heard of Ivan the Terrible.This incredibly well-made documentary was heart-wrenching. The facts stated by survivors will keep me up at night and brought me to tears more than once.Their honest recollections of the cruelty inflicted upon so, so many men, women and children were beyond comprehension. But, did they have the right man in front of them?Their rage was justified; but was it the actual Ivan they were accusing?Yes, of course, I\'d be sure one moment, then convinced quite otherwise the next.Watch it. All of the way through. You HAVE to.The participants of this trial then and presented again now in this documentary was sheer brilliance. I can\'t say that I enjoyed this film, but I am very glad to have seen it. Clearly, I needed the education.'"
"'There are two kinds of zombie films, great and crap. As zombie fans know, the crap exponentially outnumber the good. Fortunately, Dead Set is far above crap & is one of the most original, interesting & gruesome movies made! Now, I hate reality TV & know nothing about Big Brother other than the Orwell novel. DS set in the BB house, has a great cast and the idea of them knowing nothing as the zombie holocoaust begins is frakking brilliant. No spoilers here other than saying the acting is superb and the sfx awesome. I only wish our British cousins would have shared it a bit sooner! This was so good, it takes the taste of Survival of the Dead & Diaries of the Dead out of my mouth!'"
"When I heard that they were making an adaptation for Cruise's 2002 Science fiction, I was hyped, Then I heard that Fox was producing, And suddenly I had mixed feelings, Although Fox is known for making great science fiction, They do tend to cut the show before it gets to take off. E.g. Firefly, Almost Human etc.Law Enforcement getting help from civilians or even criminals seems to be quite the trend in TV shows these day e.g. Limitless,Blindspot,The Mentalist, The Blacklist etc. As the pattern continues with this series, As one of the three PreCogs is hidden amongst civilians trying to prevent crimes from occurring, however without his siblings, There is only so much he can do, As he is only one piece of the puzzle and it doesn't seem to be enough. Although this is produced by some serious names including Spielberg, It is a fairly weak adaptation, Especially when compared to the movie.Grade: F"
"'Based on a Stephen King novel, this TV movie adaptation is about the passengers on a red-eye airplane flight from L.A to Boston who awaken to find that the rest of the passengers and crew are gone, and they are all alone on the plane, which will soon run out of fuel. Fortunately, there is a pilot on board, who tries to land the plane at a nearby airport, only to discover that it is also empty, and that they are being pursued by giant, howling monsters called Langoliers that seem to be devouring time itself...Potentially interesting take on time travel, with an appealing cast of characters(except Bronson Pinchot, quite good playing an obnoxious and terrified child-like man who knows all about the Langoliers from his hideous father.) cannot save far-fetched premise, and the primitive CGI Langoliers have not aged well... Still, not the worst way to kill three hours!'"
"'This remake simply shouldn\'t have been, there was no need to make it or expand on an already competent original.I\'d heard nothing but bad things and I fully understand why. It\'s not that it\'s poorly made, it\'s just so very mundane.Standing at over 4hrs split across 3 episodes this remake misses the point of the original story altogether. Gone are the iconic scenes including the blood filled elevator and creepy twins, gone is the bike down the corridor or dead lady seducing the father. And no there isn\'t a Here\'s Johnny moment.It\'s all replaced with lack of originality and mediocrity.The cast do their best but nobody could have turned this around, it simply should never have been.Cliched, boring and I don\'t mean to be harsh but that kid looks like he ingested the whole ugly tree.Plain and simply bad.The Good:The cast do a decent enough jobThe Bad:Kid is just awfulEnding is far fetchedPoor writingWhole thing is just so unecessaryThings I Learnt From This Movie:The classics need leaving the hell alone'"
"'I have to admit that I was initially fearing that Jennifer\'s Body was going to be another generic teenage horror movie. But luckily it turned out to transcend mediocrity and be more than an average teenage horror.It was because of the cast that I had feared as much. I mean, Megan Fox, come on. But she actually stepped up to the plate and delivered where it counted, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.The story is about a girl who catch a ride with some questionable Guys. And fearing her gone, her friend is relieved to find her coming back home. But Jennifer is not the same person anymore; she is so much more.As for the story, well, it wasn\'t revolutionary to the horror genre by any means, but it was entertaining. And it delivered where it had to.The practical effects were quite good, as were the special effects. The slow breakdown of Jennifer\'s body throughout the movie was particularly impressive.I have seen this movie twice now, granted with years in between, but the movie does have enough contents to sustain more than just a single viewing.'"
"Diablo Cody's follow up to Juno. Its a nasty and illogical little horror film about what happens to Jennifer after a night at a roadhouse turns deadly. Put me into the camp of those questioning Cody as the next big thing, oh wait I'm already there. I don't think the film works. I found it surprisingly dull. Its way too knowing, often artificial. The dialog doesn't have the snap of Juno when it hits the witty notes (Cody won the Oscar so comparisons are inevitable, though not really fair). A large portion of this is Cody's fault since she crafted the story, which didn't work for me (I don't think she understands what she's sending up), and the dialog which sound at times like a copy of Juno.You also have to blame it on the director who seems to be filming some other type of movie that has a boy eating demon running through it. Nota horrible nasty disaster that some have called it, I just think its a miss"
"Now I like Quentin Tarantino's movies on the whole, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my favourites of his. But Inglorious Basterds, as much as I wanted to like it, is not among Tarantino's best.Granted it is very well made, with the cinematography and scenery amazing. Also the music is superb and Christolph Waltz is brilliant as the SS colonel being both charming and deliciously evil. Despite these high points, in my point of view it is just too uneven. Story-wise, it is essentially a series of vignettes and of variable quality too. There are some highlights such as the opening and the resistance-bar rendezvous, but there are some dull and bloated parts too unfortunately. The script has its fair share of wit but it is also some very stilted and ropey dialogue too. The characters come across as rather caricatured and clichÃ©d, and the other acting is so-so at best. I actually think Brad Pitt gives one of his weaker performances here I'm afraid to say. And I also don't think Tarantino's direction is innovative or authentic enough, while I didn't thinmk much of the ending.Overall it has its moments but these moments weren't enough as a whole. The result is a disjointed and altogether disappointing and somewhat self-indulgent effort. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and I was very disappointed by this film. It is not the format - TV series and miniseries can do wonders in the science fiction genre - just take the examples of 'Earth 2' or 'Jericho' or even 'Dune' which had to compete with a David Lynch feature film. Here we are dealing with a bad treatment for one of the best novels in the history of the genre.Almost everything is wrong here. The first novel signed by Crichtonwith his own name gets an actualization where we see once again a TV president of the United States quite far from the charisma and power his position should have, we see villain generals plotting against the nation and the world with an unbelievable stupidity and a team of scientists that endlessly debate in cryptic techno-slang while never caring to make us feel for them, neither when they debate the fate of the planet, nor when they kiss, nor when they die. Effects are average minus, and it is only the basic skeleton of the Crichton story and the classic idea of his about mankind as the wizard apprentice that opens the Pandora box of science that gives the action some consistency and interest. The good film that this fabulous novel deserves is yet to be made."
"Bad acting, slow, unbelievable story and after i watched for what seemed all day long, I saw I was only on Episode 6. Couldn't bear the thought of wasting 5 more hours of my limited lifespan so I turned it off and moved on. On the bright side, I was able to cook dinner and clean up the kitchen without missing a lick of the plot."
"'It seems like a no-brainer to me that an adult sex comedy should first and foremost be sexy. But director Edward Zwick and his writers must disagree with me, because, abundance of Anne Hathaway\'s boobies and the seemingly endless scenes of naughtiness between her and Jake Gyllenhaal aside, I found little to titillate me in this droopy comedy.Hathaway, though a fine actress, has absolutely zero sex appeal, so she\'s a terrible choice for this role. And it doesn\'t help that she has no chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Therefore, the entire movie\'s bottom falls out from under it, because the whole point is that these two oversexed young \'uns with a fear of commitment (he because he\'s a mimbo, she because she\'s got a degenerative disease) find in each other the soul mate who makes all the hard things about relationships that they\'ve been trying to avoid worth dealing with. It\'s hard to believe these two are soul mates when they have about as much romantic spark between them as I have with my own sister.Edward Zwick has long held a place in my top 5 list of least favorite directors, and this movie didn\'t do much to change his ranking.Grade: C'"
"'Just watched the first episode which will also be my last. A tiresome piece. Pseudo-revelation monologues, brain-numbing dialogues. Indescent proposal written all over it, only Zellweger managed to be even worse in her seductress role than Redford. Her trying to play a cold role is pathetic at best. The rest is a very pale background for what looks like a badly thought-through story. Good looking female doctor, big pharma trying to suppress an important invention, some personal cheesy story to spice it all up. Meh. I have better ways to spend an hour at the TV.'"
An engrossing and graphic three hour depiction of young love with the relative novelty that it's girl meets girl rather than boy meets girl.Also a sign of the times (and probably that the film is French) is the casual abandon with which people drink and smoke as if it were still the 1950s.
"'I have to say, I found this to be a huge disappointment. I thought the first act was great but after that I just lost more and more interest in it. I want to do this in a few bullet points. What was up with Adele\'s sexuality? I thought the first act made it obvious that she\'s actually a lesbian and, although she\'s tried to make it work with males, she\'s just not able to (as evidenced by the events with the super hot guy in the beginning... If you don\'t want him, I\'ll take him Adele!). I thought this was very firmly established, so then why is she supposedly hooking up with a guy later on because she feels lonely? I thought being with men didn\'t fulfill anything in her? But she\'s with a man later on because she feels lonely? I wouldn\'t have a problem with this had the first act not contradicted this. Am I missing something? Maybe someone can clarify it...'"

"I found Halloween 2 to be an awful movie, but I have seen worse. The directing was awful. There was no continuity for the script, and the concurrent movie stories did not intertwine well. The movie had no build up for the story just action. Even the action scenes were predictable. Does Rob know how to create characters who are other than trailer trash. Everyone uses the f word and yells. Rob needs more balance persona for his movies characters. There were a few good parts to the Halloween movie. One see's how angry and deranged Micheal is. Just nothing but anger with this guy. The other theme that big people are hard to hurt message got across well with the film. I notice silence with the Michael character creates a stronger emotion than dialogue. I give the movie a 3 out of 10."
"I really enjoyed the first attempt of Rob with his view on Michael Myers, but here things go terribly wrong. As with so many sequels the killer is more in the headlight with stupid things. Remember Freddy Kreuger suddenly peeling an apple with his glove. Here we have some weird things going on, he's seeing his mom dressed in white with a white horse. Michael going to the supernatural. Even his sister has the same problems, she's seeing the same demons. All of that takes the movie away from being a slasher to another dimension. Even the fact that we see Michael without his mask is for me not done. It takes away the mystery of the killer. It's like Pinhead (hellraiser) standing in full light. Even the part of Loomis is sometimes too long and takes you further away from Michael. Not as good as his first attempt."
"'Halloween II starts up where Rob Zombie\'s Halloween ended. Laurie Strode and Dr.Loomis killed Michael in the finale.Laurie is in hospital recovering from her wounds.Michael\'s body is on the way to the hospital too,transported by medical staff,but our beloved serial killer ain\'t dead.He promptly starts slaughtering his victims.He also has a visions of his dead mother accompanied by a white horse.The evolution of Dr.Loomis(Malcom McDowell)is laughable.He is just a money-hungry celebrity,who doesn\'t want to protect the world from Michael.Halloween II looks dirty and grimy with many scenes shot at night.There are some extremely gory murder scenes,the action is fast and the suspense is completely absent.In Halloween II Zombie did indeed make the film his own and in doing so completely destroyed the mythology of Loomis and the character that so many true Halloween fans admired.4 out of 10.'"
"'The film picks up where the other one leaves off. The dead Michael Myers is carted off on the meat wagon. Oh, Wait! I\'m not dead yet. I don\'t want to get on the cart! He wonders around the countryside for two years and then on Halloween he is back doing van conversions. The characters fell off a cliff. The writing for the second part was very substandard. I was disappointed with the sequel which included the addition or Weird Al, Margot Kidder, and Octavia Spencer who went to better things.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Sylvia Jefferies +uncredited)'"
"I have let the story unfold over 5 episodes before writing this review.The character development is inconsistent, and the plot lacks any cohesion.The first season of Heroes, fully developed the character, before they were integrated into the plot line.This story line and plot, seem to be written by the same writers that went on strike in Season 2, and ruined a great show.Anyone familiar with the back story of Season 1 of Heroes, will find the characters actually annoying. Katana Girl and Ren (Hey let's call them what they really are: Ren and Stimpy) MUST die.They add nothing new to the story. It has been 5 episodes and I am just as confused now, as I was during the opening scene of Heroes Reborn.I tried to like this, but I can't. The characters are too plastic for anyone who knows the back story.What could have been a great viewing choice for a change, is just the same garbage recycled.As for me...I am waiting for the series finale of Downton Abby in 2016.There is absolutely nothing worth watching in the 2015 prime time TV season. Netflix to the rescue, once again.Wayno"
"'Mad Max: Fury Road is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it\'s plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don\'t mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn\'t like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.'"

"Poor direction, like a soap opera, awful dialogue, don't let a toff write about real world as it's not like that, trying to do satire, possibly in the House of Lords.Even the continuity is all over the shop and the music, why? Incorrect police and army procedure. Typical BBC sickly PC rubbish, every race and sexual preference crammed straight in, all boohoo stories making out how poor refugees are treated, how women are victims of the male oppressor, the Israeli's are all war criminals, the church hates gays but they are all gay themselves, not forgetting that all the services are racist etc. In fact if they had travelled through the countries they would be economic migrants but god forbid the BBC saying anything truthful. When it comes to the story, well it jumps to suit itself, implausible is nothing and you will laugh at the drug delivery system, seriously.\nAs for the acting, well even Mulligan and Simm look rigid and uncomfortable, the rest have probably been on some afternoon rubbish like Doctors. The quicker the BBC understand that the real world exists outside of London they might make the 21st century, remove the licence and let them work in the real world."
"If ever there is a real movement to curb the excess of violence in films, this should be the standard to show as an example.There is enough shooting and other forms of violence all over the place including dance halls, the church, on the street, you name it.The story in itself gets lost with all the violence that takes place. Everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazing.When a killer's wife dies, Keanu Reeves, the grief stricken widower, is soon robbed of his car and his beloved dog put to death by the son of a fellow gangster. As a result, all hell breaks loose and nothing is spared.This is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected."
"This could be a fruitful exercise, if tackled with care, and a willingness to find nuance in a subject that's deeply fraught. But Hare, whose work has always had a polemicist strain, paints only in black and white."

"I liked this show. I kinda like the actor who plays Dracula. I think this show does some original stuff with the lore and that is pretty cool. It is the first time I've seen Dracula portrayed as someone who was bored and saw people as so beneath him that he passed the time by mistreating them. Yet he also was lonely and people were the only people he had to keep him company. There was some horror, some humor, some good acting and some bad. Some violent imagery in a few scenes that was kinda neat. It's not brilliant Dracula. (But it has moments,)"

"Between this and Red State, Smith really doesn't seem to have any idea of how to mix comedy and horror well together. All he knows how to do is make one half of each film horror and the other half comedy without successfully finding a balance. Tusk's first half is better than all of Red State, but that second half is just... wow. Depp usually annoys me and this was no exception. Parks was very good but ultimately one can't rise above this sort of material. Oh sure, much of the first half was effective and so I'm giving it points for that, but wow as it goes on. Nonsensical dialogue that doesn't work and preposterous scenes that aren't amusing or funny."
"'After a promising beginning ,the movie has nothing to offer after the mutation.And even that is a SSSSS rip off (1973),this tale of a doctor who transformed man into snake ;but the Bernard Kowalski movie featured an impressive final scene ,when the monster\'s tears begin to fall;on the contrary ,tusk drags on and on and on and does not pull any punches .The best scenes belong to Johnny Depp,particularly this sequence in the eating-house where the detective called Lapointe stuffs himself with Junk food ,while sparing the horrified Ally no horrible detail ;this is a good moment of black humor.'"
"'I got to admit, during the start of this movie. It seemed like it would be a at least an entertaining ride with bizarre elements. In another words, by the starting few minutes I thought this movie would be a treat. However after the first few minutes, the movie really started to plummet. The movie is like The Human Centipede except without the shock factor, nor is it suspenseful or scary. I am not sure if the movie is trying to be funny with some goofy scenes, but it isn\'t funny either. The movie isn\'t super awful, but it just seemed like the movie was done as a joke. Or it\'s just a movie made with the thought of putting Smith and Depp\'s daughters in it. The protagonist is a bit of a jerk, but I have seen worse, however is not in par with Kevin Smith when it comes to the level of being an asshole.4.6/10'"
"'Being a person who\'s heard of Halo, but knows nothing about it - this was the movie to watch!! Or, so I thought. It\'s a miniseries, which allows for all kinds of back-story and exposition. Instead they spend all the time on brief character development in a recruit center. They come under attack, but since the Halo story hasn\'t been explained, it\'s just another sci-fi story. One of the core parts of Halo, so I\'m told, are the Spartan\'s. These are shown in bad pirated video, and not explained. When the action starts, it\'s pretty wild, but again I really didn\'t know what was going on. Summary: For a Halo fan it\'s too much about the recruits, and not enough action. For the newbie like me, it was too little background. So, it fails for both potential audiences. Good flick though, for a generic sci-fi. Bad flick for a signature presentation of a iconic name like Halo.Follow-up Note: If you can watch Halo Legends (2010) before this movie, then it will make sense. It fit\'s in rather nicely as a side story in the larger story.'"
'The camera angles and jerky screen movements are designed to hide the fact that very little action is actually happening. The costume department is a cross between a Dan Dare comic and cheap child like pretend superhero clothing your aunty bought you when you were 8.I am a huge fan of science fiction but I am amazed at how poor this actually is. The props make the first series of Star Trek look good. That at least had the advantage of realistic characters and good story lines.I find it hard to believe it is intended for adults. There is so much decent scifi around now that this is really something of a timewaster.'
"'Confusing at times and visually vibrant, this Alien tie-in is not going to satisfy the most serious fans of the series and will without doubt not inspire any new ones.Relying largely on CGI cinematography and contemporary razzle dazzle while sacrificing story and character development is unfortunately a modern trend that seems to be overwhelming the focus on any sort of intellectual intercourse. There are few really sharp minds on board and the crew is made up of the now clichÃ©d motley mess where the most interesting personality is the robot.Taken at face value and avoiding any analysis of the should have been interesting story of ancient artifacts and human origins, one could possibly enjoy this as visually slightly interesting but sophomoric science-fiction. However, everything is shades of gray and one might ask, whatever happened to Technicolor?There is some gruesome horror, and it all looks truly futuristic and believable, but again, it seems shallow and without a soulful purpose except choosing to believe. It fails to deliver a script that is the minimum of mature material and sophisticated science. Rather disjointed and unsatisfying, it is a letdown, to say the least, to the anticipation of a long awaited follow-up to two of the most popular and entertaining entries in the sci-fi/horror genre. There are few surprises, and fails the Darwinian mantra of evolutionary excellence.'"
"'Weak adaptation of Odyssey, The, one of the most famous book of the Ancient Age. Assante is convincing as Ulisses but the rest of the cast gives shallow performances. The special effects are equally weak and the movie is too overlong. Some good scenes, however, like the battle with the ciclops in his cave. A average program for a lazy day.'"
"Marcus Nispel directed the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, so why shouldn't he get a shot at Jason? This film is more than just a remake of the first film. It's really a bit of the first four all in one.We watch Jason as he watches his mother get killed by a camp counselor. Thirty years later, he kills every single teen who has comes to Crystal Lake looking for marijuana, except for Whitney, who reminds him of his mother.Weeks later, some rich kids come to stay at a fancy cabin. They're all fooder, too. Only Clay, Whitney's brother, can save her. Finally, Whitney acts like Jason's mother and stabs him, but he comes back at the end, rising from the lake.This is a slick, CGI animated take on the Jason mythos. I'm more into the Savini school of gore, so there's a lot of this that didn't work for me. It's not a horrible film by any means. But it's not the best of the series. And while it did well at the box office, it was also the end of the series."
"'While this version expands the story, which was OK in itself, the charisma of the performances just was not there. I enjoy William Hurt as a rule, but in this case his performance as Duke Leto hurt. Alec Newman\'s Paul was overly whiny. Saska Reeves was too young as Jessica and then did not even play the role in the sequel, causing a jarring break in consistency. Admittedly some of the costumes were more entertaining in this version, but the still suits of the Fremen were totally unbelievable. One could not conceive of anyone lasting very long in them sitting by a lake much less in the middle of the desert. In the long run the original 1984 theatrical version is the better bet. Plus it had the blessing of the author as well.'"
"'The only problem with this version was the lack of money put into exterior shots and special effects.In fact, scenes in the desert were filmed on a pile of dirt with a panoramic backdrop surrounding the actors.But where this film suffers in lack of scope for what should have been a vast expanse, is made up for in true to the book story and timeline of events.I wish we could have the exteriors and effects from the David Lynch version imported to this version.But even with the faulty special effects and exterior sets, the production value of this modest made for sci fi channel miniseries had us glued to our TVs for 3 days in 2000.I was later given this on VHS, and then later on DVD and later in HD. I just got done watching it twice through and then Children of Dune twice.Both brilliant, but this first part is the best of the two.'"
"There's a moment in Guardians of the Galaxy when Rocket, the film's talking raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), is accused of faking his laugh; coincidentally, there were quite a few people in the cinema I went to who I could have hurled the same accusation at. Yes, GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments, but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However, even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments, this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun, delivering enough weird and wonderful characters, fantastic worlds, spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time. Director James Gunn's eclectic and vibrant universe is brimming with such imagination and visual splendour, all accompanied by a poptastic '70s/'80s soundtrack, that the film proves a treat for the senses despite its obvious shortcomings elsewhere."
"'James Gunn co-writes and directs this fantasy piece based on the Marvel comic book. Two hours of extremely exciting action, adventure, drama, comedy, inspiring cinematography and unbelievable CGI. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is an arrogant space pilot that makes a living collecting junk and most of all wants to be known as the \'Star Lord\'. Quill has gotten his hands on a rare space orb coveted by Ronan (Lee Pace), a bitter intergalactic warlord. Peter gathers a ragtag team of oddballs that are destined to be heroes as they stand between Ronan and the destruction of the galaxy.Fast paced and held together with a soundtrack featuring the likes of: Redbone, Runaways, Elvin Bishop, David Bowie and Raspberries.A talented cast that includes: Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Benicio Del Toro, Karen Gillan, Christopher Fairbank, John C. Reilly and Glenn Close. Plus the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel.'"
"This film was a 4 hour film. I watched it hoping it had a better ending then the previous 3 hours and 58 minutes. I thought the plot of the story was so fragmented. To many so called good men going bad. Same scenario, lust for some other man's wife or girlfriend. There were really no heroes,no one that had honor and nothing to come away with but a lot of fighting. There seemed to be no good against evil like Lord of the Rings. It was evil against the lesser evil. Lord of the Rings had fantasy, fighting, ugly characters orcs etc. Lord of the Rings had soldiers that were courageous, loyal, honorable, fearful, faithful,love and more. Lord of the Rings had meaning. it had good against evil and the good people always resisting even when they were scared and knew that little chance to win. Merlin had people that could not be trusted even valiant names known in other medieval stories. Merlin wasn't a good magician either, so much for magic I guess. This movie also mentions Christians and makes them out to be just as bad as the evil people. The acting wasn't bad but like Mab the evil woman it is time to forget her and it."
"This TV mini-series may be of some interest to young audiences who enjoy the myths of the days of knighthood, dragons and sorcery. It's an okay film made by Hallmark, but nothing special. It's mostly about the magician Merlin and his ongoing battle with an evil witch, Mab. But she's even made up from the original legends of King Arthur and his knights of the round table.With only one dragon encounter here, and very little hand magic by Merlin, this series is mostly about feuding among clans for the kingship of ancient Britain, and semi-humorous attempts of the evil queen to try to control the history of the kingdom. Miranda Richardson is the best of the cast as Queen Mab and the Lady of the Lake. Martin Short is very good as Frik, and Helena Bonham Carter is good as Morgan Le Fey. Sam Neill seems bored with the whole thing and the rest of the cast are just so-so."
"'I was terribly disappointed after seeing this Oscar winning film for 2007. Why did this picture win the best picture Oscar? It is absolutely horrendous. The Coen brothers seem to have a very warped view of life as we saw in FARGO and O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?If I were Javier Bardem, I would have been embarrassed to accept the award for best supporting actor for playing a totally depraved killer. His voice sounded as if he were on record and was placed on slow speed. While he portrays an absolute maniac, it was just horrible to see how he goes around with his gun blasting away at his victims.The film would have been much better had it been more about the drug deal going wrong. Instead, we see 2 guys after money and we know that the latter is the root of all evil.Tommy Lee Jones becomes a philosopher in the last scene of the film. Did anyone realize that the movie ended abruptly?This is a totally awful film, way too violent for my taste and others.'"
"'When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge\'s intentions of driving off the native humanoid Na\'vi in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland.This film was pretty good when it was released the first time and called Ferngully. This time, it is a thinly veiled political message with some awful animation. Iam aware of the work that went into it, but it still ends up looking like a cartoon, which is a failed endeavor.I can watch films and say how technically beautiful they are, but I\'m not impressed by any technicality, said Abbas Kiarostami. And that is exactly right. If Avatar is praised for its technology, and not for its direction, acting or intriguing plot, what good is it as a film?'"
"the reason i give this show one star, is because there is no negative stars rating, seriously, its that bad, not enough that he whole premise of the show is weak, 90% of it revolves around the sordid love life of a 16 year old who has two hunks in love with her, a bunch of friends, a cool mom, super powers, and yeah..she is the one, Bella swan much? when will Hollywood stop profiting from the shallow and vain egos of American teen girls, can we have a show with some substance? would it kill them if the hero actually had to earn his status through some hardship and humility? and to top this off the ending is the worst cliff hanger of all time, with no second season even confirmed, and even if there is to be a second season of this insult to anyone with taste, the ending is still God awful. my advise don't waste your time, i did that for you so you wouldn't have to. cheers."
Linda (Sandra Bullock) and Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) are married in a suburban family home with two daughters. Sheriff Reilly tells her that her husband died in a car accident. She is heartbroken but she wakes up next morning to find Jim perfectly fine. Then the next morning after that is the funeral with her mother Joanne (Kate Nelligan) and best friend Annie (Nia Long). Her daughter Bridgette has terrible facial lacerations.This tries to be a loopy time jumping movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job portraying the confusion. The movie does confusion too well and intensity not well enough. It's a pretty boring confusing mess. I still give points for Bullock's acting but this is a hopeless exercise.
"'. . . such as, What IF Satan is Real? and What IF the Devil always has been Top Dog in the U.S.? THE WITCH shouts a resounding You Betcha! in answer to both questions. If THE WITCH\'s viewpoint is correct, it certainly would make a few turns of events easier to understand, such as the unparalleled Genocide wiping out 90% of 837 Native American Nations, Black Slavery, The Civil War, Concentration Camps for the Japanese, John Wayne\'s anti-Semite Witch Hunts, and Trump in the White House. Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson\'s THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It\'s as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal. This film does more to show Evil Triumphant than any movie Hitler\'s Videographer, Leni Riefenstahl, ever churned out. The only caution to be made is that THE WITCH seems to have emanated from Satan\'s Playground, a.k.a., Canada.'"
"It's 17th century New England. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) lives with her family on an isolated farm. The local village banishes them for religious disagreements. Her parents are strict and God fearing. Her younger brother Caleb has lustful thoughts about her. Her younger twin siblings Mercy and Jonas are obsessed with the family black goat Black Phillip. Thomasin is playing with baby Samuel when he suddenly disappears. A witch in the woods has kidnapped and killed him. The farm is failing and the father is forced to hunt. Thomasin jokes by scaring Mercy about being a witch which comes back to haunt her. Caleb goes into the woods to gather food. Thomasin insists on joining him but it goes badly. Thomasin falls off the horse and Caleb is found in a sickly state.The movie gets really interesting around the midpoint. The first half feels slow and muddled. I had to watch the first half again to get a hold of the entire story. It's a matter of clarity and flow. After Samuel disappears, the family should be out of their minds searching the woods. Instead, the movie skips ahead a few day to them in a depressed state surrendered to the baby's fate. It's missing the emotional and plot connective tissues. The second half is much more intense paying off some story aspects. The lead girl Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. The brother and the father are also great. This is an intriguing psychological horror."
'i will say first off that the idea of this is really good. But did anybody notice how bad the script was and the acting i was actually laughing and rewinding because it was so terrible. the problem when i watch a show and i actually notice something like the script or the acting being crappy thats really not a good thing. like when the tin man says keep your head cool before you lose it thats when i lost it. and When DG and Glitch get attacked and in a really stale voice DG says lets get outta here i burst out laughing. so i am done my rant almost. i also found that the sets were really fake in the fact that it looked like the actors never actually were moving i don\'t know if that is only me. even after all that i have to at least give this a 5/10 for the idea and being somewhat entertaining.'
"I'll even take the Bates Motel in Psycho after seeing this truly awful film. How did the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody and F. Murray Abraham ever get suckered into making such a colossal mess as this film?You would think that this film could have done without the constant narration and would have been on the scale of a Grand Hotel like atmosphere. Instead it concentrates on the relationship of a concierge and bell boy, with the former jailed for allegedly poisoning a frequent elderly guest. Most of it concerns itself with the bell boy aiding the concierge's escape from prison and the two constantly alluding the authorities.To me, this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Abraham relates the story as he did when he played Salieri in Amadeus in 1984."
"'Honestly it is heartbreaking, and devastating to know these girls were wrongfully and disgustingly assaulted by Epistein and co. That Maxwell one and the other powerful people should be squished from their roles because of their dirty paws. Even Trump boy and Prince Randy Andy should be taken the flick cause I have no doubt they were involved in the pedo ring also!!!!!I\'m so glad that this Netflix documentary is brought to light for everyone to take a good look at!!!'"
"As much as I dread being exposed to this kind of subject matter, I decided to put myself through this purely to learn more about this incredibly high profile case. Unfortunately, the documentary doesn't really go into enough detail about Epstein himself. Prior to watching it I had no idea how Epstein became rich and what his and public and private lives were like. Having watched it, I still don't really know too much and felt short-changed in regards to the other famous people who may be involved in this disgusting underworld.The interviews with the victims were incredibly sad to watch. Yes these scenes were drawn out and repetitive but I fully appreciate these women being given a platform to share their experiences. I also felt the show did a good job of keeping things as objective as possible and not playing judge and jury, as tempting as that must be. I sincerely hope there will be some kind of follow-up to this story and that the other pieces of human garbage involved in this paedophile pyramid scheme are put through the wringer."
"'Just watch it for everything. BGM, performances, cinematography everything. To be honest, one of the finest indian contents which has the potential to give you a nightmare.'"
"'This film is about Batman having to stop an evil mercenary from destroying Gotham City.The Dark Knight have set the bar so high that it is so hard for Nolan to match it. While watching The Dark Knight Rises, I became increasingly confused. I was then told that it has many links with the first Batman film. As I don\'t remember the plot of the first one, I became completely lost as to what was happening. Even after I understood what was happening, things are still unconvincing. For example, the ending twist makes no sense to me. Why would Miranda Tate require the help of Bane to destroy Gotham City, when she is in control of the device already? The Dark Knight Rises may be an entertaining film, but I could not get into the story. It is far too confusing as it tries to play the Infernal Affairs game, where good guys are bad but bad guys are good. It contains elements of the first Batman movie from years ago which people would have forgotten about already. The special effects are great, but the whole film is lost in a confusing and less than convincing plot.'"
"Director and screenwriter Christopher Nolan keeps the Batman franchise alive with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Eight years after Batman(Christian Bale) has left guarding Gotham and actually being labeled fugitive, it is time to resurrect himself. Gotham City is actually crumbling under rampant crime and a lacking anti-crime act. Was it for the greater good Batman being inactive? A ruthless terrorist leader named Bane(Tom Hardy)has put together a dastardly plan to rip a decaying Gotham apart, as well as destroy Batman's legacy. Mild mannered and aging Bruce Wayne must summon what is left of his spirit and rebuild his physical skills to not only defend himself, but once again come to Gotham City's rescue. Special effects are awesomely brutal and the action high octane; just maybe the most entertaining of the franchise. A commanding cast that also features: Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a miss-cast Anne Hathaway."
"'Brooding plot with a wonderful atmosphere of heavy rain and doom mark this film.While the acting is good by all concerned, you just know from the eerie beginning that the tables shall be turned on the supposed investigators. Is Leo Di Caprio living in a dream world, living a tragic fantasy or being taken to the cleaners? I thought of the 1944 Gas Light, when Charles Boyer was trying to drive wife Ingrid Bergman insane.That\'s what this appeared like until reality set in.For a film regarding mental institutions, we see very little acting out on the part of the inmates.'"
"Kind of like The Dome. Pointless. I'm used to disappointment when it comes to SF in the movies and more so on TV. But this show managed to roll up into one big package everything shallow and pointless. Halfway thru the first episode it hit me: I don't care. Don't care what happens to the characters, don't care what happens to the ship, don't care what happens to the plot. Its just plain dull -- which is a common byproduct of a committee-meeting type of story creation. Instead of a good solid idea we get stuck with 15 mediocre ideas and then the writing staff stands up and pats themselves on the back because they 'agreed' on the storyline *and sold it to some studio*. Which was probably the point. What happened to all the good storytellers? Or any of them for that matter. The best thing about watching the first episode is I can safely skip all the following ones and save myself a lot of time."
"When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5."
"'I\'ve watched and reviewed a little over two dozen vampire flicks here on IMDb, and as a testament to how well received this one is by vampire fans, the only other movies that rate higher are Nosferatu and Let the Right One In. Speaking of which, the character Petyr (Ben Fransham) in this one is a pretty straight knockoff of Nosferatu from the 1922 silent film. To call it a parody might be somewhat of a misnomer, the picture skewers everything from vampires to zombies, werewolves and anything remotely resembling the undead, and does it in hilarious fashion. The thing is, the picture doesn\'t feel like it\'s trying to be a comedy, but the zany situations and clever writing make you laugh even if you don\'t want to. There\'s also a fair amount of sleight of hand going on, as with Vladislav\'s (Jemaine Clement) horrific depiction of his archnemesis, The Beast. And then, when we finally meet The Beast (Elena Stejko), you have to kick yourself for falling for the set up. It\'s all cleverly done and quite entertaining, so even if you\'re not a vampire fan, this one might get you to change your mind.'"
"'Recent decades have brought along so many good crime dramas from UK and Scandinavia that it is easy to become pretentious and eager to find errors and unrealised solutions. But if the story has framework, the events are intertwined. the wrongdoer(s) do(es) not become obvious too soon and performances are far above average, then I have no reason to purse my lips. I liked Michael C. Hall here as well (he was neither Dexter Morgan nor David Fisher), but my biggest admiration goes to Audrey Fleurot whom I had memorized in some catchy French TV series and films. Well, the teens were again performed by adults and there is a twist in the ending which I began to predict - but it did not create wtf! reactions. True, Safe is e.g. no Luther or Line of Duty, but definitely not a disappointment to be rated with a couple of points only.'"
"Just watched the first episode and I couldn't care less how this develops: there's not a single character worth caring about. Add in Michael C Hall's awful take on an English accent, Amanda Abbington's horribly died hair and the general amateur feel to this and there is absolutely no reason to watch the remaining episodes."
"'Street Fighter: Assassin\'s Fist was allegedly supposed to be THE movie for the Street Fighter franchise. I can\'t claim to have had any expectations to this, given the previous movies.But this 2014 really is the icing on the cake. It was abysmal on so many levels. The storyline was just a mess, and there was no real coherency in it, and I must admit that I dozed off more than once throughout this movie, and ended up getting up and leaving, not finishing the movie.The characters in the movie were adequate, but wow it was so hard to take Ken seriously with that hair. He looked like he had a really bad wig attached to his head.The fighting was adequate, but there wasn\'t much of it. Which otherwise would have added a bit more to the movie.The Van Damme Street Fighter movie was at least more spoofy, so it was more enjoyable to watch because it was so out there. And the Legend of Chun-Li was at least a step in the right direction, but not really great.For a martial arts movie based on a video game, Street Fighter: Assassin\'s Fist was a snoozefest on a grand scale, and it failed to entertain me on any level. As such, I give it a mere 1 out of 10 stars.'"
"Note: I have watched season 1, and I don't plan on watching further if they make moreThis show has a few good moments finally combining these heroes (you need to watch the previous seasons, Daredevil 1 & 2 at a minimum), but it never really wows the viewer. It is consoling that the season was not dragged out to a full 10-13 episode season; the 6 episodes were plenty to get the point across."
"THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) *** Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, Brian White, Amy Acker, (Cameo: Sigourney Weaver) The eponymous genre flick gets itself turned inside out in this at times too-cool-for-its-own-school underpinnings from filmmakers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard : five stereotypical young adults venture into the secluded topiary where upon visiting the abandoned edifice Â.well let's just say things start to happen and then ÂthingsÂreallyÂstartÂto..HAPPEN! While the clever premise gets giddy in its final act where the collective horror ya-yas are set loose (literally) there is little terror and more in the line of show-me-how-you-can-top-THIS ethos, the expectations high eventually plateaus but those-in-the-know fanboys/girls will eat this up begging for more. Kudos to Kranz as the clear-eyed stoner getting in touch with his inner Shaggy in this long-form SCOOBY-DOO meets THE EVIL DEAD by way of a cosmic Rubik's cube plotting."
"Five teens go to an isolated cabin in the woods for a weekend. In the basement of the cabin they find an assortment of relics, books and ancient artefacts. In reading from a book they then inadvertently summon a family of zombie killers. However, they've only just scratched the surface of what the cabin is hiding.Pleasantly surprised, but ultimately disappointing. Was expecting your average (i.e. crap) horror movie but for the first 60% or so of the movie it was very interesting. Intriguing, engaging and, most surprising, funny.From a point, however, it degenerates into your usual humans-vs- ghouls/zombies schlock, and from then on it is incredibly formulaic and tiresome."
"'Damn I wish I woulda checked the credits first. Had I known Hayden Christensen was in this movie I definitely would not have tuned in. Is there anything that he is in that isn\'t ruined by his presence? Jumper... Human version of X-Men\'s Nightcrawler. I guess the fact that these paladins hunt the Jumpers was to make it more exciting, but really it was still lame. I mean honestly, if these guys can jump anywhere and get anything, then certainly they can grab a gun and shoot any one of these paladins, right? I, personally, was rooting for the paladins. The only jumpers shown were self serving, narcissistic, greedy criminals. People like that get arrested in real life. Not everyone can just take what they want when they want it, we actually have to work to earn money and vacations and such. This movie was only mildly entertaining and only because of the CGI. Take away the CGI and this movie is a 100% flop instead of the 60% flop that it was.'"
"'a film like many from last decade. easy, unrealistic, basic story, action and a love story as bonus. it is difficult to be a revelation. but, far to be real bad, it is almost nice, amusing in few scenes, fake in others. important is the idea who seduce, in same measure, the reader and the viewer. and, sure, the role of a long series. in rest, Sci Fi and adventure. or only images from a dream who remains alive for many of adults. a hero out of place, a secret and a war. fight scenes and few drops of romance. nothing original. and basic problem could be not the story - it is only a movie for teenagers- but the option for Hayden Christensen who is not exactly the most inspired David. but the presence of Samuel Jackson in a routine character represents a kind of compensation. like the images. but, out of objections, it is one of films who could open the interest for book. and that is its great virtue.'"
"I'm a bit dissapointed: couldn't they get Mila Kunis too to complete the holy trinity? You know, Rachel Bilson, Kristen Stewart and her ... everyone is calling them that, right? No? Ok kidding aside and back to the movie though (especially because Kristen does not really have a big part here ... not that Rachel Bilson is doing much either, just saying): this is a light and entertaining affair if you suspend your disbelief with more than a stellar cast.If you can get Samuel L. Jackson to play any part in your movie ... I'd say you are good. Doug Liman directing also helps a lot. So while I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece and full of cliches and odd character traits and choices ... you can put all those aside and just enjoy the movie ... it is possible! Just do it - otherwise it is probably better not to watch the movie at all (effects have aged quite good by the way all things considering)"
"Who knows why a great artist want to take on such an iconic unique movie? Maybe he wants the challenge. It starts with a dark depressing vision of Charlie Bucket's (Freddie Highmore) poverty. He finds one of five Golden ticket to visit Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory. The movie spends too much time in the Bucket home, and takes too long to get to the chocolate factory. Most of the audience already know what's going to happen. The Bucket home should be nothing more than an intro, but it goes on for more than 30 minutes before we take one step into the factory.Once we get Johnny Depp on screen, the movie gets moving better. I love the Tim Burton vision at his weirdest. Freddie Highmore is certainly a very capable young actor. Johnny Depp adds his own sort of weirdness. I love his weird take on Willy Wonka. On the other hand, I'm not sure about the Oompa Loompas. Mainly, I'm not sure about using the same actor for all Oompa Loompas. I do admit that it makes them even weirder. I would have given this a 7/10, but I have to subtract 1 for the slow start without Johnny Depp."

The Bucket home should be nothing more than an intro, but it goes on for more than 30 minutes before we take one step into the factory.Once we get Johnny Depp on screen, the movie gets moving better. I love the Tim Burton vision at his weirdest. Freddie Highmore is certainly a very capable young actor. Johnny Depp adds his own sort of weirdness. I love his weird take on Willy Wonka. On the other hand, I'm not sure about the Oompa Loompas. Mainly, I'm not sure about using the same actor for all Oompa Loompas. I do admit that it makes them even weirder. I would have given this a 7/10, but I have to subtract 1 for the slow start without Johnny Depp."
"I wouldn't say that Donald Sutherland is my favorite actor. What he shows here though, although very good, does spoil the movie. Why you ask? Because whenever he's on screen, you get the feeling, what real acting is like! He could've centred the movie, but he's shown to little in it, to help it (this was of course on purpose, to elevate his performance, when he's on screen), on the contrary he's spoiling it!The other actors (most of them younger) are good or rather can be good, and they showed it in other movies (I'm sure), but not here. But that's not all, the back and forth on many subjects on display here and the direction of the movie (which I don't really see getting anywhere, without taking too many detours), destroy all the romance that could've been there (or indeed was there for a little while). I never believed in any of the emotions the characters where trying to convince us they had (except Sutherland). And if I don't believe them, then there's no movie that I could like more better!"
"I see a lot of people saying there was no story line or plot. I believe they may have been so shocked by the graphic sex scenes that they failed to pay attention to the rest of the movie, There is very much a plot and also a life lesson.'6.1"
"'While I didn\'t try to think of the song, the line Baby don\'t hurt me ... don\'t hurt me no more came to mind. And it\'s not like it doesn\'t suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let\'s get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn\'t or don\'t already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you\'ll see everything of them in this. It\'s not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It\'s about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can\'t have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their world view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...'"

"This movie is eerie, spooky, and creepy but never scary. I suppose that it's good that the main character, Ellison, was a true crime writer so that the viewers could be duly clued in on what was going on. In an attempt to write another best-seller, Ellison moved his family into the home where the subjects of his next book were killed.Layer by layer, super 8 film by super 8 film the story unfolded but to me it never amounted to more than a malevolent drama. There were never any real shocks or surprises and nor was there any real frightening moments. The movie is OK. The movie will keep you tense with the musical scores and the clichÃ© unexplained-noises-investigations-in-the-dark. But in the end many of those tense moments were met with disappointment."
"'Let\'s not say awful but rather dreadful to describe this 2011 film. If everyone lives but to 26, look at all the money that would be saved by not having to pay pensions, social security,Medicare, etc. As ridiculous as that statement is, that\'s how ridiculous this entire mess of a movie becomes.People try desperately to by time. What an existence. Those who buy their way into life, they never age. When you run out of time, as shown on your hand, (you\'d think that everyone in the film had been in a concentration camp by the numbers stamped on their hand)you simply drop dead.Of course, our hero rescues our heroine and takes her away from her boring existence to start robbing banks, the main one owned by her father. No, they\'re not exactly Bonnie and Clyde, but that\'s just what is needed to give credence to this abominable film.'"
"I wonder how many times the word 'time' is mentioned in In Time. It's a lot of times, I'm sure, but I didn't take the time to count. Maybe next time.Starring Just-In Time-berlake and Amanda Seyfried (whose name doesn't really lend itself to any clever time-related puns), this film has a very intriguing premise - that time is a commodity that can be bought or sold, allowing the rich to live indefinitely while time runs out for the poor.Sadly, writer/director Andrew Nichol fails to do the idea justice, his film spending most of its running time being little more than one long chase, as his photogenic leads try to bring down a big-time time magnate, while Timekeeper (i.e. cop) Raymond Leon works around the clock to call time on their antics. It'll only be a question of time before you'll be picking holes in the plot, Nichol having clearly not spent enough time ironing out In Time's wrinkles.4/10, just for keeping me amused for most of the time with its incessant use of the word 'time'. Best line of dialogue: 'Time'."
"'This movie is fine if you don\'t think too much. First of all, there is the fundamental premise that one can use time as currency. Who decided that at 25 years of age the denizens of the future, would die unless the begged, borrowed, or stole time. We are never given that explanation but all people have a sort of countdown clock on their forearms. Those who have accumulated time become hunted by those who wish to steal it. There is also a set of sectors where people have as much time as they want. Everyone stops aging at 25 and either dies or maintains that age (hence mothers may be 100 years old and look just like their 25 year old children). Also, a grasp of the wrist of another person can transfer time. Justin Timberlake is given a huge cache of time by a suicidal man and sets out to avenge the death of his mother, who has succumbed before she can get reloaded. He takes a spoiled young woman with him and they go around blowing up the system. They are pursued by a sort of latter day Javert, who has dedicated his miserable life to being a timekeeper, arresting those poor souls who are just trying to live. Anyway, it\'s all pretty absurd, unless you look at it as a parody of our own grasping society and our social classes. Pretty far fetched, even if disbelief is suspended.'"

"With Henry Selick as the director, you know, the man behind Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, I expected a special treat when I watched Coraline especially in 3-D. Don't get me wrong, I did like the images that were presented throughout the movie in the rare stop-motion animation style in an era where everything else that's animated is usually done by computer. And there were interesting characters that made one want to get involved for the whole picture. It's just that after a while, there seemed more style and not enough substance to really keep you involved in the story with your eyes and ears thinking awesome the whole time but your heart wondering if there could have been more to the characterizations. In fact, since this was based on a novel, I'm sure there were some cuts that had to be made to make a certain running time. But like I said, while there wasn't enough intensity to make this truly thrilling, Coroline still was pretty exciting at certain points and many young children watching this will not get bored when the climax comes. So on that note, I am recommending Coroline for animation buffs and anyone who doesn't mind if their under-12 children holds on to them for a while..."

"I was interested in seeing 300. After seeing it, did I like it? Sort of. Starting with the good things, it is visually, technically and stylistically amazing with wonderful costumes and sets. The battle sequences are superbly shot and quite realistic, and the music and acting(the protagonist played by Gerard Butler is very charismatic) are decent, as is the direction. Plus there are some compelling parts in the story, and the script has its moments. However, 300 is not very well paced, in fact for me it was quite slow and pedestrian in places, while there are one two many clichÃ©s and stereotypes, one or two them I agree bordered on offensive. Overall, it was an okay film but it didn't wow me. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"'This film tells the story of an FBI agent who is given a chance to volunteer to work for a mysterious group of agents to take down a drug lord in Mexico.Sicario tells a story of agents going into Mexico and carry out attention seeking operations abroad. The film lays out events plainly and in chronological order, but yet there are a lot of pieces missing and hence I have a hard time fully understanding the story. What I get is that Emily Blunt\'s character does not fully know what she is doing, why she is in the team, and she also disagrees with what the team does. She has a lot of questions about the operations, and frankly I have the same questions. As a result, the film is not able to fully captivate me, even though the plot is thrilling and adventurous.'"

"SICARIO (2015) *** Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal, Daniel Kaluuya, Jeffrey Donovan, Raoul Trujillo, Julio Cedillo. Absorbing yet gradually paced look at the ongoing war on drugs at the US/Mexican border where Blunt's gung-ho yet continually over-her-head/need-to-know mission with an elite government task force has her sinking into a moral quagmire of Just What The Hell Is Going On Here paranoia and conceit. Brolin provides some weathered charm as her blind-leading-the-blind comrade-in-arms while Del Toro gives his best performance since winning his Oscar as a varying shades of grey op whose still-waters-run-deep demeanor has a chilling effect. While the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan enters Michael Mann territory of on-the-job stresses involving life and death with enough ballast, director Denis Villeneuve's somewhat glacial pacing does tax the nerves when it's not nerve-shredding with its peppering of well-executed violence."
"Knight and Day is a romantic action comedy film starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.The film is directed by James Mangold.The plot follows the adventures of Roy Miller (Tom Cruise),a spy on the run, and June Havens (Cameron Diaz),a car restorer.He is seen watching Havens, and he bumps into her a couple of times as they go through security at Wichita Airport. While she is making her way back home to Boston from Kansas after picking up spare parts for her deceased father's car that she is restoring for her sister as a wedding gift. Even though she has a confirmed reservation for her flight, she is told at the gate that it is overbooked.The movie follows their adventures across the globe as both run from their perpetrators.The movie was pure fun and nothing more.It was a joy ride as we see a new roles for Cruise and Diaz in comedy.It is also worth mentioning that the chemistry between them seems lacking. I prefer them in together in Vanilla Sky and future drama films rather than this comedy. A 6/10 rating is decent for this film."
"I wasn't expecting the remake to Nightmare on Elm Street to be as good as the classic original, but I was expecting a decent enough film. As a remake and on its own terms, this Nightmare on Elm Street is a mess. Is it the worst remake out there? Not quite, Psycho and Wicker Man were worse. But it is among the most pointless, at least to me. This time round, the story is over-simplistic, the characters shallow and dull and the script jumbled. And apart from one, the acting is terrible, especially from Kyle Gallner. The editing in general could've been tighter while the effects lack clarity and distract from the atmosphere rather than enhance it. Speaking of the atmosphere, it seemed bland here, the nail-biting suspense and build ups seem very subdued and I don't think I remember being shocked by any scene from this movie. The only redeeming quality I feel is the efforts of Jackie Earl Haley. Robert Englund's performance was iconic and wonderfully creepy so Haley had big shoes to fill, and while he is a little too small for the role his makeup is believable and he does make a valiant attempt with his characterisation. All in all, pointless and messy. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
"'As Long as Corruption and the Savage Exploitation of the Weak and Virtually Helpless People are Extorted and Preyed Upon there will Exist, at Least in Fiction, The Vigilante.

So in this Reel World there is The Equalizer.Hollywood has Often been Called the Dream Machine and that\'s About All the Folks Can Do is Dream On. So Let the Dreaming Begin. It\'s a 60 Year Old Denzel Washington, Sporting His Aging Well, as the Titular Hero. Antoine Fuqua is the Director and the Character is Brought Back to Life from the TV Series (1985-89).The Film\'s Style is Not Ramped Up as Some of These Tend to be, but is a Slow Cooker even when it is Dispensing with a Multitude of Macho-Looking Bad Men with More Tattoos than Brains. The Movie is Not as Good as the Genre Gets but it is Passable in a Dream Time Kind of Way and the Catharsis is Present and that\'s what the Doctor Ordered, for it Seems Like that is the Only Cure for a Disease Infesting the Planet, The Evil That Men Do. Long Live the Fictional Vigilante.'"
"It follows breaks the mould of modern horrors, by lacking gore, blood and the usual set of rules. Instead this film moves at a slower pace, and relies on storytelling and the dying art of suspense. A quite unusual storyline, which sees some unknown being torment it's victim perpetually, with only them able to see it, with the victim followed day and night without any let up. The only way to escape the grips of the being, to sleep with someone and pass the curse on, or so the theory goes anyhow. A pretty clever story with lots of twists. Well acted with some decent characters. The film has one help of an accompanying soundtrack, which is straight out of the eighties, big and brash, I loved it, worked so well for the film. Some great moments, most notably the beach scene, slow and very deliberate. If you've watched Torchwood, you'll know why I was reminded of an early episode.Really good film 8/10"

"'Ghosts are real. Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) has known this since childhood when her mother died and her spirit warned her, Beware of Crimson Peak. As a young woman, she\'s trying to publish her ghost story only to face sexism. English baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) has come to America seeking investments from Edith\'s father Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) for a clay-mining machine invention. Carter distrusts the failing aristocrat and his sister Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain). His investigator Holly finds something damning and he pays Thomas to leave his lovesick daughter Edith. Carter is murdered and Edith marries Thomas. They go back to England but Dr. Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) is suspicious as the Cushing fortune is liquidated to the Sharpes in England.This is a beautiful Gothic horror from Guillermo del Toro. It is simply gorgeous. On the other hand, the story lacks thrills or scares. There is no real mystery since the Sharpe siblings lay out their cards early on. It\'s also unlikely that Carter wouldn\'t reveal the secret to his daughter. All of it takes away the tension. The Sharpe mansion looks beautiful in a haunted manner. The story needs some reworking to inject more thrilling tension.'"
"Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his powers comes responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong. The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield. A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films."
"One thing this movie about college level a capella singing competition demonstrates is that the actresses involved are multi talented from the control freak played by Anna Camp to the lovely Brittany Snow and of course Anna Kendrick. They can sing dance whatever. But Anna Kendrick as a the lead wasn't quite right. She is better in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick's face can't express different types of emotion, eg anger sadness happiness - it's all the same showing a bit of teeth like a beaver. The girls are the stars here. The leading boys are rather dorky and forgettable. Breakout comedic star Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy provides comic relief.The writing isn't that good some scenes could have been funnier. But at least it isn't as hyper and freakish as Glee. Some rather surprising negative stereotypes shown but overall it's quite a feel good pleasant movie."
"'First things first: I have not seen any episodes of the original TV series this is based on. So no comparisons to that from me. This might have been a good thing from what I hear. But let\'s get back to this movie, that would\'ve faired worse if Captain Jack ... I mean Johnny Depp wasn\'t in it. My niece who watched it with me, said she could spot Capt. Jack mannerisms. I hope that does not spoil the movie experience for you, but I guess this is the curse or the bad side of having created a great character.Still that is not the weak point of the movie. Not even the weirdness, which I thought was nice mostly. But the movie itself is just not funny enough. It is pretty silly, but unfortunately not in a good sense. There is a scene where my niece went That letter looks like ... and while she was kidding I assume, I was still thinking Kids these days. But apparently Tim Burton thought the same thing ... He played right into that and it just doesn\'t work. Best scenes are in the trailer, the rest can be forgotten (including one very dark moment at a camp fire). Not as bad as his Planet of the Apes re-imagining, but still far away from his best efforts'"
"This is a comedic low brow 'The Big Chill' played for laughs and trying to make some points about parent and kids and relationships and material things are not important starring some rich Hollywood actors.The death of their old basketball coach causes some of the winning basketball team of 1978 to reunite. Adam Sandler is a rich Hollywood agent with a hot wife, Salma Hayek, spoilt kids and a nanny. Kevin James has a 4 year old who still drinks breast milk, Chris Rock has a wife who works whilst he is a stay at home dad, Rob Schneider lives with an older woman and has 3 kids from previous relationships who turn, two of them simply to provide eye candy for the audience.We have some gross out jokes such as urinating in a water-park pool, the dead coach's ashes being thrown over food, a boy breast feeding etc. Some spoilt brats too busy texting and wanting the finer things in life on demand.Over the weekend the kids enjoy the simpler things in life and learn to get along with other kids and grow up a bit. The adults too learn to value their loved ones but in a slight story some of the 'issues' come out of the blue.Still it is sporadic fun, watchable and Steve Buscemi pops up to provide the biggest laughs."

"I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good."
"Let me state right off the bat that I like both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I loved them both in Wedding Crashers. That was a very funny movie. This one, not so much, and because it's rated PG-13 and not R, there isn't as much raunch as in WC. Actually, this one is supposed to be even more of a nice vibe between comedy and sweetness than WC and I actually liked that. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I didn't find much that was funny during many of the beginning scenes. It did pick up much near the end and overall, The Internship wasn't too bad. Part of me wouldn't even mind seeing it again if asked. Just don't expect a non-stop laugh-getter is all I'm sayin'..."

"'Adventurous animated feature; CGI enhanced and at times constructed with visual brilliance. Shrek, Nemo and even Cars fear not; MONSTER HOUSE is just not THAT good; but nonetheless a hoot to watch. The photography is better than a lot out there. Some of the humor may actually go over the heads of the prepubescent throngs with eyes glued to the bright and colorful screen. It helps to have well liked characters. DJ(Mitchel Musso)lives right across the street from an old house owned by Mr. Nebbercracker(Steve Buscemi). DJ and his friend Chowder(Sam Lerner)lose a ball to the crotchety geezer, who has a heart attack before the boys can get their ball back. The house takes on a life of its own, gobbling up the ball...just an appetizer before gulping up innocent animals and foolish trespassers. A new friend in the neighborhood Jenny(Spencer Locke), yes...a girl, joins forces with DJ and Chowder trying to convince anyone who will listen to the unlikely story of the freaky activities of the Monster House.

"A failed attempt to make a dark Movie that smacks of Hollywood hokum. All the best Actors in the world cannot save this phony, artificial, and turgid study of some very serious character flaws and professional responsibility from becoming an unbelievable, shallow and failed attempt.It all comes off as superficial renderings and it's trek to the psychological and sociological implications of alcoholism, drug addiction, prostitution, and marital dysfunction are all like empty pamphlet prose and well meaning. but slapdash, TV Documentary intervention shows. The whole thing rings untrue.Nothing well directed here and the parading of recognizable name Stars in and out of the Film do nothing but draw unwanted attention. The placing of some great Classic Rock to heighten the mood and then abruptly fading out after only a few seconds is an abomination and signs of a Hack.These are only some of the irritants in this overrated dud and clearly illustrated that the Writer and Director have no grasp of the material. Adding to all this, the pathetic and pat ending, from the trial forward, is unforgivable."
"'\'The Lobster\' is genuinely innovative, at times hilarious, but overall, its abstract. There\'s really nothing here that seems offensive, but I don\'t know what it wants to be. At best, its Funny, but Fk\'ed Up!\'The Lobster\' Synopsis: In a Dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.I liked \'The Lobster\' to an extent. I liked the bleakness of the near future & the absurdity of its characters. Its a violent story, but a world fumed by havoc. But, overall, I didn\'t understand what this film was trying to say. Sure, its about human dependency, but why the graphic nature & why such an unsatisfying end? I was puzzled once it ended.Efthimis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos\'s Screenplay has some great dark humour, but is confused & overstuffed for the most of it. Lanthimos\'s Direction is well-done, as the bleak mood is correctly maintained. Cinematography & Editing are top-class.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell slips into the character & performs with admirable conviction. Also, his overweight appearance adds to his part. Rachel Weisz is ever-marvelous. John C. Reilly is beyond brilliant & is also the film\'s biggest highlight. His lisping man is a marvel. Ben Whishaw is okay, while LÃ©a Seydoux oozes menace.On the whole, \'The Lobster\' is a very weird film.'"
"'It was the recent ad campaign for the sequel that brought Hotel Transylvania to my attention (much to the delight of my five-year-old), but the movie never really gets above eh. It has the usual stale kids\' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it\'s a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it\'s short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there\'s an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).My kid liked it, so the movie\'s got that going for it. But for entertainment that offers multi-generational appeal, I\'ll have to look elsewhere.5/10'"

"The original 80s Transformers cartoon series was all about shifting toys from shelves, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to find that Michael Bay's prime directive for this live-action blockbuster also seems to be making money through selling stuff.Transformers has been designed to leave kids longing to reenact its bad-ass auto-bot battles via Hasbro's new range of authorised action figures, whilst giving adults the urge to load a top-of-the-range Apple iMac, Hewlett Packard laptop, an X-Box, and a crate of Mountain Dew into the back of a brand new GMC TopKick truck.But blatant product placement isn't the only thing that Bay mercilessly bombards the viewer with: he also pummels his audience into submission with an onslaught of complex CGI effects, endless loud explosions, awful dialogue, rapid fire editing, cringe-worthy moments of comedy, and lots of shouting from Anthony Anderson as an irritating gluttonous hacker. Plot development and logic are almost non-existent.Granted, for many people the sight of giant alien robots transforming into vehicles and battling each other will be entertainment enough (even I can appreciate an awesome heavy-metal smack-down), while others will welcome the sight of a sweaty Megan Fox bending over a car to fiddle with the engine, but for a movie costing $150 million, I expect more than what is essentially a visually impressive two-hour long advert for kids' toys and luxury goods."
"'Get past the hype; and you still have an intense piece of Sci-Fi from Director Michael Bay. Great F/X and sound. The Earth is the chosen battleground for two races of intergalactic robots, the Autobots and the Decepticons...the battle is for the possession of a cube shaped talisman, hided somewhere on Earth. These metal aliens are able to change into various objects like cars, trucks, boom boxes, aircraft and such..and supposedly these visitors have been among us for quite some time. The spoils of victory is the survival of mankind and the chance for the enormous mechanical victors to return home...the planet Cybertron. This big budget blockbuster stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel and Bernie Mac. Another Spielberg success.'"
"'In the first place, I consider it a blasphemy to remake a Wes Craven movie, even one as disgusting as The Hills Have Eyes. In the second place, the idea of nuclear tests turning people into bloodthirsty mutants - had they used it in the \'70s - could have been one of the many movies involving fear of the government (along with The Parallax View, Three Days of the Condor, All the President\'s Men and Capricorn One).So, they not only remade a Wes Craven movie, but they used it as an excuse to show gratuitous violence. I usually really like slasher movies, but I found nothing entertaining about this one. It was just plain gross. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levine should have known better than this. Avoid it.As for anything about nuclear tests and their effects, just watch The Atomic Cafe.'"
"'My 17 year old neighbor warned me, she had seen this movie at the theater with her boyfriend and she told me to stay away, it isn\'t a very good movie. Well, it was a free rental from my public library, so what the heck? The premise is interesting -- radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing from 1945 to the early 1960s caused a sub-race of mutants that are very, very mad. And love to kill things and eat them raw. A family heading west on vacation stops at an out of the way gas station and are told of a shortcut that turns out to be their undoing. The main of the movie is to see if they and their dogs will survive in the rugged desert hills against these mutants. Hint -- they don\'t all make it.The movie uses blood and gore for shock value, a number of times. The best thing about the movie is that I was very glad when it was over.'"
"A true thriller. Driver(Ryan Gosling) is one of those quiet guys that doesn't shy away from excitement. Multi-talented; well, let us say that Driver is well skilled. A Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic by day and quick moonlight getaway man. His life isn't mundane, but a bit isolated. Driver comes to the aid of a troubled neighbor Irene(Carey Mulligan)and her young son. The relationship begins showing some promise, until Irene's violent husband is released from prison. Driver's skills will soon be needed. A high price will be put on vengeance and survival. This story line is smooth as silk lubricated with rocket fuel. Some scenes are gruesome and the violence is, well violent. Gosling is outstanding. Mulligan is fine as the mousy love interest. The cast is rounded out with better-than-average performances from Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks. Kudos to director Nicolas Winding Refn."
"Based on the Alan Moore/David Lloyd strip of the same name (which first appeared in top British 80s comic, Warrior), V for Vendetta is a thoroughly entertaining adaptation which will most likely appeal to fans of the source material, but may leave others expecting summer blockbuster style action a little bemused.V (Hugo Weaving, who remains masked throughout the entire film), is a freedom fighter in the near future determined to bring down the bully boy fascist government that is controlling England with fear and hate. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded. Although I fear that the appeal of the movie will basically be limited to fan-boys, I do hope that others seek this one outÂthey might be surprised by how good it actually is."
"Everything about this film is excessive. Even the length, but that's forgivable considering just how good, all the time, this is. From the beautiful snowy opening that manages to combine magic and menace, to the thoughtful and anguished ending, this is one hell of a ride. The violence is truly awful yet impressively awesome in its magnitude while the invasive and uncompromising scenes of sexual depravity cannot but help to convey an appalling ambiguity. As I suggest, the length would normally inhibit me but I can assure anyone similarly put off, this is that good, bad and really weird you will not object. Oh, and some way into this extraordinary film I realised that there was an ultra dark humour working here too. Just to make things that little bit harder to comfortably digest."
"'A secret agent (Byung-hun Lee) tracks a vicious murderer (Min-Sik Choi) who killed his fiancee. I SAW THE DEVIL takes the serial killer tale and turns it upside down (and inside out!).If you\'re expecting another psychopath vs. The police / cat and mouse story, this movie will be a surprise. ISTD uses this premise, only to expand on it, resulting in one of the best revenge films ever made. You might even catch yourself feeling -sort of- sorry for the killer!Unlike most such films, this one goes a long way in showing the ultimate price of vengeance. Both protagonist and antagonist are relentless, leading to a finale that is as thought-provoking as it is visceral. If you love movies like LADY VENGEANCE, OLDBOY, etc., then you\'ll probably enjoy this...'"
"I didn't think much of the first HUNGER GAMES film but nonetheless I was interested to see how this sequel, CATCHING FIRE, held up. The answer is that it's even worse than the first film, a pointless retread of the first film's storyline that bears more than a passing resemblance to the two Japanese BATTLE ROYALE movies.Once again an ultra slow pacing and ultra lengthy running time combine to make this a near unwatchable slice of boredom. It's incredible that in the whole first hour and a half of the film absolutely nothing happens other than to set the scene and the mood. It becomes instantly apparent that more care was taken with the incessant costume changes and scenery rather than the calibre of the script or the acting, because both are truly mind-numbing.Eventually the action kicks in towards the end of the film, but it's all as uninteresting and CGI augmented as you'd expect; the 12 certificate just isn't right for a film with this subject matter. Jennifer Lawrence remains a bland and wooden presence as the protagonist, and Josh Hutcherson is even worse; at least newcomers like Jeffrey Wright and Sam Claflin bring a little charisma to their parts. In addition, one of the most unforgivable things about CATCHING FIRE is that it has no ending at all, just a plot development that leads to the next in the series. It's a real cheat."

"This is a prequel/sequel/reboot/rework to John Carpenter's 1982 classic horror The Thing. There is the big reveal twisting the story to loop it around. They could have played with this a lot more than what they actually did. It's convoluted but I'm willing to buy it. In fact, it added something interesting. Not the same for the FX.The aliens are now almost all CG. That's a big problem since the original had some of the most iconic real FX. It's a spit in the face for fans to replace it with CGI and it doesn't look good anyways. Going inside the saucer is a big mistake. This stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton, Eric Christian Olsen, but nobody really stands out. This is a good idea but executed without understanding the appeal of the original."
"I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?"
"'Yes, Attention Spans seem to be getting Shorter, but what about Memory Loss or the Inability to be Aware of what has been done and Better. So many Critics and Fans of this Movie have called it Original. Really.Are They Completely Ignorant of the Sci-Fi Genre, The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits or Countless Movies that have Explored this Subject. This is about as Unoriginal as it gets. It is Recycling to be Kind or a Rip-Off and Parasitic at Worst.The Film has a Good, Clean, Semi-Attractive Look but the Story, Acting, and Droll Style becomes Tedious as the Movie Drones On. There are Patches of Interesting Things but as a Complete Piece of Work it is just too Familiar.The Predictable Ending, the Inordinate Amounts of Tilted Heads and Close Ups, and the Uncomfortable Sex Scenes Destroy any Appeal that the Film is Building Upon. Joaquin Phoenix, Thankfully, Sports a Mustache to Cover His Scar and that\'s a Good Thing because it can be a Distraction at times, but here there are So Many Extreme Face Shots that it would have been Horrifying.Highly Overrated Movie that is Not Deep, Not Romantic, and Not Technologically Interesting. The Film tries to be All these Things and Barely Manages a Blip of Intrigue Concerning its Conceits. Worth a Watch but Stop with the This is so original. Accolades. it is Anything but.'"

"Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure."
"Okay but nothing special.The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation. The only attempts at character development - the love story - felt weak, and were quite dull and tedious.This said it is entertaining enough to keep you watching. Not a must- see, but it's okay."
"'I set my hopes quite low before watching this, and even then was disappointed. Dull and unoriginal. Nothing good about this at all.Avoid.'"
"The predictable film where an unknown virus spreads like wildfire throughout the world with the usual havoc resulting among the populace.We see the usual in such things-brave people, who are willing to risk their lives in search of a cure, those ready to exploit the situation such as the drug companies, people panicking while debate rages how much the people should be told. Of course, the president is hidden underground and various U.S. cities are quarantined. What else would you expect from this Irwin Allen-like disaster film?I don't have to tell you about the predictable ending. Imagine, the near beginning, when Gwyneth Paltrow, a victim of the virus, was cheating on husband Matt Damon and the Disease Control commission has to inform him of this. Terrible.The ending credits thank the Disease Control Commission. I say no thank-you to this routine rip-off film Jude Law, as the cynical reporter, has the best idea in that everything stinks-that sure includes this picture."

"Jaguar Paw leads a hunting party in the jungle with his father. They encounter refugees escaping from an unknown danger. Their unprepared village is attacked by a Mayan hunting party. Most of the adults are enslaved and brought to the city. The land is suffering from drought and plague. The male prisoners are being sacrificed. There is a solar eclipse just as Jaguar Paw is about to be sacrificed. The men are given an opportunity to run for their freedom. When Jaguar Paw escapes, the Mayan warrior leads a chase to avenge his son who is killed by Jaguar Paw.The first half of this movie is absolutely harrowing and brutal. It is powerfully shot by director Mel Gibson. The little kids are heart-breaking. His escape and journey has a few too many coincidences. I buy the jaguar as some kind of prophetic sign just like the solar eclipse. However, he doesn't need to rescue his wife and kid just in the nick of time. The final image also doesn't need to be that. It seems to suggest something that isn't quite warranted. All in all, it can't be denied that this is wonderful filmmaking."
"'I was immediately disappointed, the movie is in full color and yet it was set in the 1500s Mayan territory, I know they had not invented color cinematography yet, it should have been in black and white.Add to that the spoken Mayan language of the characters had English subtitles, I don\'t think that is authentic, how would the Mayans have known the English language in the 16th century?The movie focuses on Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw, with a young son and a wife who is pregnant. When their small forest village is raided at night to capture women for slaves and men for sacrifices, Rudy hides his family in a deep pit and vows to return to save them. So that is really what the whole story is about, can Jaguar Paw escape and save his family? I enjoyed the last approximate one-third of the movie the most, the extended chase through the forest.The movie is loaded with graphic violence, and according to experts on Mayan culture not particularly authentic, but hey, it is a movie for entertainment. One reviewer called it a Game of Thrones for the Mayans.There\'s even a scene from Field of Dreams, where several men run into a cornfield to try to disappear. Plus a line from Midnight Cowboy, as in Hey, I\'m walking here as a Mayan escapes a falling tree.Overall a very mixed bag, I\'m glad I watched it, on Amazon streaming movies, but frankly it is mediocre.'"
"This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film.However despite it's long running time The Half Blood Prince element feels rushed and the Harry and Ginny relationship forced. Even the wonderful ending of the original book is underplayed.Yates manages to bring a lightness of touch to quite a dark installment but stays true to what will come in the future films. I didn't initially like this film but now, seeing it as part of the overall saga am convinced it is one of the strongest."
"I don't speak Klingon, I know nothing about the technical specifications of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and I can't recite the complete history of Starfleet. Hell, I don't even know what the correct term for a Star Trek fan is (is it Trekker or Trekkie? Beats me!). I do, however, have an affection for the original TV series, having watched it as a youngster in the 70s (at teatime, after school), and I really wanted to like this film.Oh well...Beyond some clever casting (the majority of the actors assembled here convincingly playing younger versions of the Enterprise's original crew) and the inclusion of some nerdy details designed to appease die-hard Trek fans, this is a failed exerciseâanother seriously flawed and over-worked piece of mainstream Hollywood nonsense. The film's unnecessarily complex and confusing time-travel story is riddled with irritating contrivances and plot-holes big enough to fly a Romulan mining craft through, while the rapid editing and an over-reliance on 'everything-including-the kitchen sink' CGI effects only add to the chaos.If this is the standard of film-making we are expected to endure, I can only hope that this rebooted franchise will not 'live long and prosper'."
"Romantic comedy starring Anna Faris playing her typical character in this rather dull and unfunny film. There's a smart, funny, observant comedy- drama to be made about the role our romantic pasts play in determining our futures. Faris and Evans have frisky chemistry until a dire, endless third act separates them for the most arbitrary reasons. Both of them play their part well as it shows, however the rest of the cast suffer. When What's Your Number? works at all, it's a testament to the charm of Faris. She delivers a joyously unashamed performance in a flailing, sputtering rom-com that gives her and the rest of a supremely overqualified cast ample cause for embarrassment. Though many scenes could have been better as it became a bore watching the final product unveil. The trailers for this film made it seem like such a funny comedy but once watching the film, it was not that funny. A few chuckles but not much else to offer. Also predictability is very evident."
"My track record with Disney cartoons is erratic to say the least. As a child I saw a few of the early ones as and when they came up, Snow White, Pinnochio, Bambi, then a long gap. As far as I recall the last one I saw was The Little Mermaid in which I recall a couple of half decent numbers, Under The Sea being one. When Frozen was released this week in the UK it garnered money reviews from about half the critics, some of which praised the score, so I thought what the hey. It didn't exactly live up to those reviews, at least not in my book, and the score certainly contained nothing to equal Under The Sea but nevertheless it was well done and on the whole entertaining. The Elsa character just about justified the title of Snow Queen but Hans Anderson would have been hard put to recognise any of it as his original story. Kids, of course, won't worry about provenance and there are some adults who'll find it easy to take."
"'Very Thin Urban Crime Thriller that is Weak, because it simply attempts to be more than it is. Even the overall Template of the Town given much Script Time falls Short of Endearing its Charm and it all seems to have a Patina of Plastic Overlay. The Buddy bits are Not Convincing or realized and the coupling of the Criminal and the Victim as Lovers seems Forced, Facile, and Artificial. It is a Movie that draws attention to what it is not rather than what it is. An Unsuccessful effort at a Multi-Layered, Sentimental yet Hard Boiled Gangster Tale of Family, Friends, and the Futility of an Environmental Entrapment.Some Stylish and Exciting Action Sequences Saves the Film from Wispy Indifference.'"
"The story as it is, did not offer me anything new. Nor was there any very clever writing, that I could spot. But it's still more than a decent effort by the makers. They chose the actors carefully and the location even more so. Sometimes the location can become a character itself and that is the case here. Even while I haven't been there myself, I can feel the weight of the town.Predictable it may be, not really having a big story or anything quite great to say either, this thriller will entertain you. If you let it that is. The flaws are there and very apparent. But I didn't feel that they were as big, as to actually driving the entertainment value of the movie down. You might feel differently of course, but try to enjoy it if you can."
"'Deja Vu all over this place. The list of Movies that are the Inspiration, to be kind, are ones that make the A-List of most Sci-Fi Fans. So here we go again and again, and once more, again just to be sure.It is quite Ironic that these End of the World Films can make an uninhabitable Earth look so Cool as to be Postcard worthy. That does make for a more pleasant Experience. But beneath all that, to be considered it must have a Story that tickles the Mind and makes Wonders of the Imagination. But here there are twist and turns, revelations and redirections that were better served Decades ago by Rod Serling and Stan Lee. This is so familiar that we feel, as the Movie unreels, that We are visiting an old Dear Friend, that is no Wiser with Age.Overall, this is a watchable wannabee that tries to make its mark in the New Age, but borrows way to much from the Old School and makes it look like a wrinkled old Story with a face-lift. All smooth and shiny but suffering from Post-Operative Artificiality. This is really a good looking Clone of a Clone of a Clone. It is real, but is it? A Soul cannot be manufactured.'"
"At first I thought maybe this would have like a very original script. It featured James Caviezel so it couldn't be bad, right? WRONG! This is the lamest Beowulf adaptation since forever... and I have seen a few.Imagine that The 13th Warrior was an alien from space, Grendel was a monster from space, the vikings are like small snacks for aliens and in the end the vikings win.However, none of the intelligence of 13th Warrior was present, nor the ingenuity of Christopher Lambert's steam-punk film, nor the philosophy of the Grendel book were present in this one. The acting was poor, the script was ridiculous, and whatever John Hurt and Ron Perlman were doing in this movie, they didn't do it right. The monster effects and design were decent enough, all 5 minutes of them.I mean, you have an Alien like monster, you have at least three decent actors and a great story like Beowulf with its myriad adaptations and reinventions. And what do you do? A poor-man's remake of Alien 3 with James Caviezel doing his Jesus routine (getting beaten all movie, then almost rising to heaven).Bottom line: stay as far away from this. Yuck! Phooey! Phuthew!"

"'My summary line might be a bit out of touch, but it was the first thing that came to my mind and I just put it there. The movie itself is anything but light (you won\'t be able to find too many funny moments in this, though the direct and dry responses by Benedicts character do help with that a lot), telling a true story, about someone who had to overcome a lot of obstacles.It might be easy for those who know the real person or to others who observed better than me, to see one of the biggest dilemmas of our central character is. There are a lot of course (not being able to take no for an answer, unable to work in a team and so forth), but I\'m talking specifically ... and a thing he might not be able to work on, even if some try to make you believe there is always a choice. Putting this all into the mix, might feel too much for some, or not nearly enough to create real tension. But the movie is very well made personal journey through a difficult time ...'"
"'maybe, I am too old for a new beginning. but the enthusiasm for the new part of Star Wars remains low. not ignoring its admirable virtues - young actors giving life to new characters, meet with old friends, beautiful cinematography, presence of Max van Sydow, a seductive new character and a mysterious one. but, out of the small lovely gifts , essential is a big problem - the film has not a story. its story. pieces from the other parts of series are puts together. all is well known and the promise for another eight parts not could save very much.sure, it is only the beginning. and the target is a new generation. but the first detail looking for in the case of Star Wars is discover the roots of events. in this case , maybe, the roots are reduced at the humor demonstration. or at shocking solutions as the death of Han Solo. but,expecting new parts, you must hope the better.'"
"'Having grown up with G.I. Joe cartoons on TV, I just had to see this movie. And I must say that I am left with mixed feelings.First of all, this is a splendid action movie with lots of cool stuff going on. Lots of shooting, martial arts, explosions and all that makes for a good action movie.However, there is very little G.I. Joe feel to the movie. Sure they have the same names as the ones in the cartoons (and comic books), sure they have the gadgets, but something is missing. That whole real American hero feel is lacking from this movie. And that is what drags this movie down.The cast is good, lots of good performances here. But at times the dialogue is halting, coming off a cheesy or clumsy.Watch it for what it is; a good action movie. Forget that you have seen the G.I. Joe cartoons (or read the comic books). With that out of your head you will be thoroughly entertained by the movie. If you go into this movie with G.I. Joe in your heart, you are in for somewhat of a disappointment.I give my rating based on the action movie aspect of the movie, having decided to overlook its lack of the true spirit of G.I. Joe.'"
"From the hilarious minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Coming of age. Normal...somewhat maybe. Awakening and most definitely remembering for three socially inept teenage boys. Seth(Jonah Hill), Evan(Michael Cera)and Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Piasse)have an outrageous night like no other. There friendship is pretty much full blown dependency and Seth and Evan are upset about going to different colleges. Plus there is the content...virgin thing to worry about. They rely on Fogell to help in scoring some alcohol to take to a wild party. This mission seems to be a failure from the get-go. A panic-driven night will supply enough humiliation to last a life time. Your mind will have you doing the outrageous...just trying to get 'some'.Funny, vulgar and a riot. Time to go in demented mode and enjoy. Also in the cast: Bill Harder, Martha Macisaac, Emma Stone and Seth Rogen."
"OK, I cannot believe that Beerfest could ever be beaten. This is the absolute worst movie of all time.I don't know how anyone can think this was funny. There wasn't one laugh in it. It was more of a documentary on what is going to happen when NASCAR fans and reality show fans reproduce. I know that's cold, but they might find some humor in this.You have to be misogynistic, love fart jokes, and think that someone getting kicked in the balls is a hoot. What's up with that.Luke Wilson has made three movies that I know of with Will Ferrell. It has definitely screwed him up. He should buy the rights to this and destroy it."
"'In 2005, the Private Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is an ordinary man with an average IQ. He is invited by Officer Collins (Mike McCafferty) to participate of a classified program named Human Hibernation Project to hibernate in pods for one year with the whore Rita (Maya Rudolph). However Collins is arrested for participating in a prostitution ring and Joe and Rita are forgotten in the pods. Five hundred years later, Joe wakes up and finds that the society is absolutely dumb. But he is arrested since he does not have any money or identification. In the prison, he is submitted to an IQ test and soon he learns that he is the most intelligent guy in the United States. President Camacho (Terry Alan Crews) invites him to join his government and help him to resolve the problem with the crop. In return, he would give pardon for his faults. Joe requests the support of Rita and the lawyer Frito (Dax Shepard) that will show him a Time Machine. Joe tries to solve the crop problem and then return to his time.Idiocracy is one of the funniest and most intelligent comedies that I have recently. The storyline is perfect and I am afraid that one day, we will reach this dystopia with the actions of demagogue and populist governments. This movie should be mandatory in classes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Idiocracia (Idiocracy)'"
"Actually it's not really American actors playing all those roles, but I tried something witty with the summary line. Something witty is also what Russell is trying to do and it's not his first time. If you consider Three Kings and I (heart) Huckabees and what he has delivered the past few years you can't help but notice a director getting better by the minute (movie).It's not easy to juggle a movie about con artists, especially when it feels like it's build entirely on something that really happened (which apparently isn't the case, which makes this even more intriguing). But whatever the case and however you feel about some of the actors, this is brilliant. For one I do love Jennifer Lawrence, but the character she is playing could not be more despicable and appalling in my eyes. So while I'm still very fond of Lawrence herself, she (and Russell) actually made the impossible possible! I kind of hated her.There is a reason why there was Oscar buzz and nominations and what not. I know I myself get sometimes tired of buzz like that. But Russell is one to look out for and I for one cannot wait for his next movie. Whatever it is, it will be good ... whether I like it or not"
I should have known when this movie started with a deer peeing into a guy's mouth that Grown-Ups 2 was setting a pretty low bar for comedy. At least the first movie had some sort of story. This sequel just throws a bunch of loosely related gags onto the screen and doesn't care if it makes any sense or if they're actually funny. It's insulting that they thought audiences would enjoy this half-baked cash grab.
"Grown Ups 2The best part of being a grown up is that you can buy alcohol for your under-age girlfriend.Thankfully, the adults in the comedy are married to fellow grown ups.Desperate to relive his childhood, Lenny (Adam Sandler) moves his wife (Salma Hayek) and children to his Connecticut hometown.Reunited with grade school buddies Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock) and Higgins (David Spade), Lenny plans to make this summer the most memorable.But for that to happen, the gang must endure a childhood bully (Steve Astin), rowdy frat boys (Taylor Lautner, Milo Ventimiglia), an estranged son (Alexander Ludwig) and angry wives (Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello).The unwarranted sequel to the awful original, Grown Ups 2 foregoes plot for the sake of puerile pranks perpetrated by formerly funny comedians.Besides, growing up doesn't mean you have to stop being a kid, it just means you can't be tried as one.Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
"The sequel comes with very little plot. Our foursome all have their child issues. David Spade suddenly has a long lost son so he doesn't miss out on the fun. There is an 80's theme party with a ridiculous townies vs. college boys fight.The humor is still crude, but perhaps a bit less than before as I found it tolerable. The film mostly relies on one liners and insults as is typical in a Sandler production. This film also highlights the talents or lack thereof of many Hollywood larvae including the Sandler clan, Patrick Schwarzenegger, and Paulina Gretzky. Team Jacob fans can watch Taylor Lautner in an uncredited role as Fratboy Andy. My how they have fallen.Will work as a rental. No hurry to rush out and see it.Parental Guide: Brief male rear nudity. 1 f-bomb. No sex. Sex talk and general crudeness including urination, feces, and fart humor. Razzy nomination"

"Mike Flanagan's OCULUS gives our thoughts something familiar to focus on and then the small details turn things a bit askew. This movie is slow burning and moody. A couple of young adults, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites)and his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) are still mystified by their patents death. It has been a decade and Kaylie is more of a hands-on thinker, while her brother is the typical skeptic. She is strong in her belief that an antique mirror is to blame some how for her parent's demise. She is determined to prove it. A haunted mirror; this is enough to have you brace yourself and let your skin tingle.Other members of the cast: Katee Sackoff, Rory Cochrane, Garrett Ryan, Miguel Sandavol and Kate Siegel."
"Well, a friend of mine told me to watch this flick. Because it had so many good reviews and a good score. Was I disappointed at the end of this horror. It was to be honest a rather slow movie. For me before things really go awry I had to wait almost 45 minutes. And even then it just wasn't scary. Don't get. me wrong. The idea was okay and the way it was shot was also sublime but the story just couldn't get my attention.Maybe it was the CGI used for the whitening of the eyes that made it laughable or all the possessed ones towards the end that made it a bit ridiculous that made me almost stop watching it. Again, the story was okay but too slow and laughable effects to really say this was a good old horror. Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) gets released from a mental hospital. Eleven years earlier, his parents (Katee Sackhoff, Rory Cochrane) get a mysterious mirror. His father supposedly tortured and killed his mother. In the present, his sister Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) rediscovers the mirror. Tim has only fragmentary memories of the incident. Kaylie aims to prove the murderous supernatural nature of the mirror. Michael Dumont (James Lafferty) is Kaylie's boss at the auction house and her boyfriend.This movie has great moodiness. Much of it is due to the cold look and the vibrating sound design. Gillan is great. There is real tension about memories and reality when Tim disagrees with Kaylie. It's an old fashion horror like a ghost story told by the camp fire. It is expertly revealed. Everybody including the kids are great. The last act does get a little muddled as it tries to ramp up the excitement while trying to wind down the plot. It would have been great to have Gillan continue as the lead as the franchise inevitably continues."

"It's 1979 Lillian, Ohio. Joel loses his mother in a steel mill accident. His father Jack Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is a deputy sheriff. His friends want to make a zombie movie for the summer. They get Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning) to be the romantic lead. Alice is not happy to be driving without a license with the deputy's son as the sound man. They are filming by the railroad when a train derails. They promise Alice to keep it a secret from her troubled father (Ron Eldard). The train turns out to be a secret military transport. While the kids continue their filming, the Air Force does the cleanup but strange things keep happening.J.J. Abrams has made a good film. He's using a lot of that lens flare that he loves so much, but the train crash looks good. The kids' acting is paramount to this and they do an acceptable job. It would be nice if they had a bigger presence. Elle Fanning is like a giant to these kids. I didn't mind that as much as her monotone voice. It's a minor distraction. Other than Elle, none of the kids have a big enough presence. Maybe they're too normal or too new. There is good and bad about that. This has both the innocence of an earlier times and the tension of a creepy sci-fi thriller. It strikes different cords. It's a bit of Goonies and a bit of Close Encounters."
"'During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.I do love the inclusion of the Walkman, the Soviets and other period things, especially the music. While I did not live in 1979, I appreciate period pieces of the 70s and 80s (Ti West\'s Satanic Panic film nailed this.) I also like that at times, the film has the sensibility of Goonies. I wish the whole film did, because these were the stronger scenes. The monster part was less interesting, actually ,than the childhood adventures.Roger Ebert summed it nicely when he wrote, Super 8 is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of film-making, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action. Abrams treats early adolescence with tenderness and affection.'"
"Teenagers in 1979 Ohio, filming a Super 8-mm movie for entry in a competition, witness a derailment at the train station; assuming the kids have the incident on film, a hard-nosed colonel with the U.S. Air Force is soon on their trail, but he knows more than they do. Boys' adventure story-cum-monster movie from writer-director J.J. Abrams, who is slavishly faithful to producer Steven Spielberg's homey touch throughout. The scenario never jells and, although the production is elaborate, the narrative is scattered to the winds. The kids, leftover Goonies, have obviously been cast for their physical differences (one short, one tall, one with braces, etc.), but their personalities are one-dimensional on film; they're generic (much like the picture itself) and fail to generate interestâbut I wouldn't blame the young actors, it's just not there in the writing. ** from ****"
"'. . . the names of serial killers or mass shooters, unless they\'re Islamists. Instead, they run One Shining Moment-type music (like at the end of the March Madness Title Game) over a victims\' photo collage as soon as they can get their paws on some pictures. But this artificial Grief Porn doesn\'t change the fact that there\'s never been so much as a made-for-TV or even a direct-to-video feature film made about any previously anonymous victim of either a mass killing or a serial slayer. The Krays, on the other hand, have had at least TWO feature films playing on the Big Screen (including current release LEGEND) to carefully detail their sordid gangster careers and all the people they killed. The nationwide Family Video chain in America has carried multiple flicks about John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Ted Bundy because that\'s just what U.S. citizens crave in the way of family entertainment. Anderson Cooper and Fox News do Americans a great disservice in making us wait five or ten years for the mass and serial killer details we have a right to learn for our own protection. Someone\'s going to make a killing when they give Americans the All-Crime, All-the-Time channel they so desperately need and crave!'"
"That's My Boy finds Adam Sandler on auto pilot, for this represents him not giving a care in the world about his fans or anyone remotely interested in watching a decent comedy. Sure this has fans, and it's not my want to chastise people's personal preferences, especially with what makes them laugh, and certainly making light of serious issues doesn't have me signing up for the next PC Brigade march, but this is pathetically played.It was a colossal failure at the box offices, and it deserved to be. Sandler and his writer, David Caspe, blend edgy offensiveness with base juvenile comedy, throwing erection and sperm gags together with incest and statutory rape was always going to be tricky to successfully pull off, even more so when Sandler and co seem to think shouting loud makes scenes more funny. It's just that it never comes off as a funny whole, just a series of mind farts dotted alongside a potentially warm bonding between estranged father and son thread.Next to this Little Nicky looks a masterpiece! It's a tough film for Sandler fans to defend, and I have been one in the past, but when Vanilla Ice sending himself up is a highlight then you got problems. Whilst Susan Sarandon and James Caan should look in the mirror and ask questions about appearing in this... 3/10"
"'And his brand new invention is acting. Although you could argue the point that playing oneself might not be considered acting, I can\'t really tell, because I don\'t know who the real Vanilla Ice is. What I can say is that he almost steals the entire movie from established actors. And he\'s not shying back on making fun of himself. In a good way that is. Sandler and Samberg on the other hand sound way better on paper than they are on screen.Don\'t get me wrong, compared to Jack and Jill (or some of his/Adams other lame comedies) this looks like a masterpiece! But the trailer did suggest more fun than you actually might have. Some odd cameos (Adam always gets whoever he wants to or at least it looks that way) that I won\'t spoil are fun and the tone gets set pretty early on. The R-rating is there for a reason and it touches a nice subject matter. Of course you won\'t get too deep into the whole thing (no pun intended), but it makes for awkward (=fun?) comedy time.It\'s really predictable, but if you let yourself enjoy it (and you will know if it is for you right off the bat!), you will have a good time watching it'"
"Good lord, Adam Sandler so much looked like and sound like a trashy messed up grease ball! I can't tell you how many times that I thought he was on drugs, because seriously that man had such energy to play this character! Andy Samburg's character looked super cute in his tuxedo! I was thrilled to think he managed to have gotten Ciara's character. They just were made for each other. Thank god he didn't end up with his crazy fiancÃ©. She was so annoying! It was disgusting to think she cheated on her brother on their Wedding eve night. At least Donny was right the first time!I was so happy to see Ice-T, his 'Ice Ice Baby' was always stuck in my head every time he appeared. Man, I wish he was my uncle. He is awesome!This movie was alright but definitely, don't show the kids this!"
"'I was amazed by this horror movie. Americans would not have made better. No lead character. No super female hero who finally punishes, destroys all the bad guys before getting away. The movie begins with characters who rapidly die, and continues with other ones who also disappear in an orgy of violence, sadism and unbearable sequences of brutality and torture. For the actor and the spectator...You\'ve understood. That\'s not for the sissies. Many people will consider it as too much.But as I told about FrontiÃ¨res, when you go to see a horror film, it\'s not necessarily for laughing; it can also be for feeling dizzy.'"
"Anna and Lucie (Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi) are friends on a mission. They are out to face and destroy the demons from Lucie's childhood of abduction and unbelievable trauma. Unfortunately, the pair have unwittingly embarked on a journey into an unknown world of terror, torture, and utter despair.MARTYRS appears to be straightforward enough, especially during the first half. Then, secrets are revealed / unveiled, plunging everything into a hideous nightmare of hopelessness and agony. MARTYRS is a bleak descent that never lets up. Once its aperture begins closing, it chokes out all light. Still, the underlying idea is ingenious. The title comes into play in an unexpected and astonishing way.Is this film disturbing? Certainly, but in a different way than a movie like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Though there is extreme violence and gore, it is not gratuitous, and is arguably essential to the story.The truly unsettling aspects of MARTYRS are more psychological / pathological, mixed with a definite philosophy and even a profound spirituality. Far deeper than most horror films, this transcends the genre. The ending is the very definition of ambiguity and bitter irony.Is it grim? Oh yes, but for good reason. Anna and Lucie do not deserve their fates. They are caught up in something beyond understanding, and so are we. This is horror at its extremity. A masterpiece in blood..."
"THE GUEST (2014) **1/2 Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williamson, Joel David Moore, Ethan Embrey. Interesting-to-a-point thriller with stranger-in-town Stevens (uncannily resembling a very young Mel Gibson) who claims to be the friend of a dead soldier and infiltrates his family with charm and deceit unbeknownst to them of just how seriously dangerous he is as a threat to their lives. Menacingly charming Stevens does all the heavy-lifting of the touch and go script by Simon Barrett and Adam Wingrand's collaboration with steady assured direction with able support by Monroe as the shrewd teenage daughter, Meyer her younger bullied yet smart brother, veteran character actor as the out-of-sorts father and a nice return by Kelley as the blinded thru grief mother too trusting to a deadly fault. While the strengths play in large favor of its lethal lead the final act borderlines a slasher film with an incredibly eye-rolling plot point of just what really is making the homicidal hero tick."
"Though the satire is heavy handed at times, there is still enough to get some really good laughs from Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux's salute to blood and guts war films.I think Stiller and Theroux got their idea for this film from The Three Amigos. If you'll remember three Hollywood silent western stars are transported to Mexico which if you'll remember was in one anarchic state during the teen years of the last century. What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups. What to do is set them down in total isolation in the jungle with cameras and explosive devices.Unfortunately that part of the jungle is now the turf of some nasty drug dealers who are intrepid actors have to do some real battle with. Especially after they capture one of them, Ben Stiller, and the ransom they demand from the producers ain't forthcoming.The best gag in the film is Tom Cruise and the hilarious portrayal he gives in an unbilled role. I can't say more because that is the whole point of the joke. Tropic Thunder could have stood some improvement, but I laughed pretty good in the theater. The film is also politically incorrect as all get out as you will discover in Robert Downey, Jr.'s part."
"This has Ben Stiller written all over it and I for once don't really mind. Lewd and crude and funny enough to crack a rib or two. Some cool action shots with rapid fire comedy. Three of Hollywood's biggest and temperamental stars are in the jungles of Vietnam shooting a war movie when everything gets too damn real. Tugg Speedman(Stiller), Jeff Portnoy(Jack Black) and Kirk Lazarus(Robert Downey Jr.)along with supporting actors and crew find themselves invading a real poppy processing location thinking they are still shooting the movie. Comedic lines fire off as rapid as automatic weapons. I personally am impressed the most with Downey Jr., who's character has his pigmentation dyed to play the role of a black soldier. The rotund Black handles most of the real crude stuff. A heavy soundtrack features the likes of: Creedence Clearwater Revival, Buffalo Springfield, The Rolling Stones, Edgar Winter and Enigma.Also starring are: Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte, Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel.If there is a show stealer it is a well padded and made up Tom Cruise playing the movie's producer. Pee your pants hilarious. TROPIC THUNDER also has wall to wall cameos...to mention just a few:Jon Voight, Lance Bass, Jason Bateman, Alicia Silverstone, Kevin Pollack and Mickey Rooney."

"'This film is about a young art student killing his insomnia by doing a supermarket night shift.The movie review I read compared this to Amelie from Montmartre, so I had great expectations. While it does not exactly fall short of my expectations, it does not quite reach it completely either. The film is artistic, and many shots are imaginative. The most striking shot is the one where Ben falls from the phone to his bed. There are many jokes that work, such as the artistic value of a bag of spilled peas, and the silly moves by the Kung Fu guy. I really liked the dialogs, and the time freeze shots. If the nudity is toned down a little bit (the stripper scenes), then this would be an even better artistic film.'"

"'Adam is a history professor who is shocked to see a film with an actor who looks just like him. Because of this, he tries to contact the guy...only to have the man\'s wife think Adam IS Anthony. So, apparently they not only look identical but they sound identical as well. Where does this go next? Well, I guarantee 100% you won\'t guess if you\'ve never seen the story!!To me, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most unusual and interesting actors today. So often he picks strange non-mainstream projects that are incredibly good, such as Donnie Darko, Source Code, Night Crawler and Prisoners. Because of this, I often seek out his films as I know they will be treats.Unfortunately, while Enemy is certainly unusual, and that is a plus, the film itself didn\'t work all that well for me. This is because the film lacked energy and instead of action and excitement, the film nearly put me to sleep. Even worse, the music really helped lull me to semi-consciousness!'"
"Intriguing and original plot...that, unfortunately, goes nowhere.The story of a man who spots someone identical to him in a movie. Puzzled and bored he tracks him down. Intrigue ensues...This initial setup gives Enemy a very interesting start. The intrigue continues throughout the movie. Unfortunately, however, it appears that the writer hit upon a great and original plot...and then didn't know what to do with it. The movie ultimately goes nowhere, ending bizarrely and anticlimactically. It starts as a Christopher Nolan movie, ends as a David Lynch movie. (Thankfully, at least it doesn't have the length or pretentiousness of Lynch's last few movies).Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a good performance in the lead role. The two identical people don't have the same personality, making his performance even more impressive, as he had to play two different people.Having written and directed the excellent Incendies in 2010 and directing the even-better Prisoners in 2013, Denis Villeneuve can be forgiven for missing the mark for once. Still one of the more exciting directors to emerge in the last few years."
"'David (Shiloh Fernandez), his drug-addicted sister Mia (Jane Levy) and his friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) travel to an isolated cabin that belonged to his parents to spend a couple of days together. Mia promises to stop using drugs and Olivia, who is a nurse, promises to help Mia in her abstinence. They discover a hidden basement with witchcraft and the Book of the Dead, and Eric reads it and unintentionally summons an evil force. Mia, Olivia and Natalie are possessed by evil and Eric reads the book trying to learn how to destroy the demon.The Evil Dead (1981) is a classic horror movie by Sam Raimi and his debut and beginning of his successful career. Despite the low-budget, Sam Raimi made a scary movie, using an original camera work and simple scenario.Evil Dead (2013) is a stupid and gore remake with awful situations. Why four friends would bring a drug-addicted to the middle of nowhere instead of to a clinic? Why should they live the car keys and a shot gun close to a person in crisis caused by abstinence of drugs? The corny relationship between David and Mia is also awful. The movie is never scary, but boring and disgusting with excessive gore and mutilations. I was deceived by the IMDb Rating. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): A Morte do DemÃ´nio (The Death of the Demon)'"
"'it is not easy to define it as a good or bad movie. because it is only part of a trend. for YA series who are the same in their essence. for the themes who are the same manner, style who defines each. few young actors. and a challenge. nothing new from Jules Verne to our present. maybe, only the ambition to say a story for generations far by classic stories. the result - a cold, not very convincing film about old values , references to Lord of Flies and technology as ingredient of an obscure dark utopia. a film almost decent. but untasted, conventional and far by credibility.with precise target, it is not surprising to not be the best choice for high expectations. because , like the adapted series, like many others series for young people, it is only a surrogate.'"
"'It seems that Hollywood is always looking for the next franchise film series aimed mostly at young adults. Following in the wake of the Harry Potter films, other series were quickly put into production to see if they could be the next billion dollar franchises. Some, such as the Golden Compass simply fizzled whereas Twilight and The Hunger Games hit pay dirt. In light of these big bucks, it\'s not surprising that Maze Runner would make it to the screen, since it\'s just the first of three books--three books which seem strongly inspired by The Hunger Games...only a bit gloomier. And, given that it\'s already earned about three times its cost just here in the States, it\'s not surprising that the sequel is due to be released next September.So is the film any good? Well, it looks nice. Other than that, no. It\'s violent and nihilistic without the interesting social commentary or originality that you get from the Hunger Games films. Instead, it\'s just ultra-violent and nasty--with scores of teens being killed for our entertainment. Plus, in the The Hunger Games films you have plucky and likable characters with some depth, but in The Maze Runner they seem much more flat and ill-defined. In other words, they\'re mostly just there to be killed or survive but little else. Overall, it\'s a film with little depth, lots of nasty mayhem and a cast of cute boys meant to appeal to the same folks who love Twilight.'"
"Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power."
"'This film tells the story of the people in Sin City, and their violent and corrupt ways of life.I wondered what a graphic novel was, it turned out it is a film with a lot of narration like a novel has. Instead of describing with a scene, they describe with words. It\'s an interesting concept, but the story doesn\'t work for me. The violence is so over the top that it made me laugh. The scene of a man with an arrow through his body is completely hilarious, and I\'m not even sure if that\'s the intended effect.The black and white effect with some specks of color may be cool at the time of release, but by now I have seen it all before so I am not as impressed with it as I expected. One thing I was very impressed with was Jessica Alba\'s dancing. I knew she could dance from the film Honey, but this time she can really dance amazingly.Sin City will appeal to some, but not to me.'"
"'Sleeping Beauty is a well-known classic fairytale by the Brothers Grimm perpetuated through several generations. Maleficent rewrites the tale but is not a bad movie; on the contrary, has a good story, screenplay, performances and special effects. Unfortunately it shows the present absence of new ideas from the writers that need to destroy or remake what does exist and is excellent. When it is a classic like Sleeping Beauty, the procedure is very sad for those that have spent their lives worshiping the wonderful fairytale. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): MalÃ©vola (Maleficent)'"
"'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button left me with mixed impressions. Brad Pitt\'s role as a man aging in reverse poses the questions of mortality and lost love. I got the feeling that the idea of Benjamin\'s approaching his eventual passing mirrored the hospital scenes as Hurricane Katrina bears down on New Orleans, leading to the destruction of the Crescent City and the end of its festive reputation. The idea that Benjamin starts out looking old, rejuvenates to the point of looking middle-aged, and ends up looking like a baby makes me think of something else. There\'s a certain period of his life where Benjamin can lead a normal existence, due to looking his age. Meanwhile, he has to spend both his youth and old age in nursing homes. He ends exactly as he started. Maybe the implication is that old age is, in a way, a return to childhood.As for the story itself, I guess that it didn\'t impress me as much as it could have, just since it seemed similar to Forrest Gump and The World According to Garp, and also Youth without Youth, about an elderly man who gets struck by lightning and starts aging backwards.Overall, I recommend the movie, although it\'s not one that I would have thought to nominate for Best Picture. Also starring Cate Blanchett, Taraji Henson, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, Jared Harris, Elias Koteas and Tilda Swinton.'"
"'While the big headlines might be taken by the Oscar nominated lead actors (and also Oscar winner, regarding Jennifer Lawrence), the other good news is that De Niro finally had a role he could relish in again. And a role we as viewers would actually like to see him in too. There have been a few lesser roles he played over the past couple of years. And while he is never able to completely disappoint, you won\'t remember him for a movie called Freelancers and others in that vain.But back to the leading couple. A couple that is really so far apart, that you know what that ultimately means for them. But Bradley Coopers character has a lot more going on than that. There are relationships that went wrong and it\'s really tough sometimes to watch him destroying himself or at least attempting to. A very good movie, with great dialog'"
"MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011) ***1/2 Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates, Aiden Brody, Michael Sheen, Mimi Kennedy, Kurt Fuller, Carla Bruni, Alison Pill, Nina Arianda, Tom Hiddleston, Yves Heck, Corey Stoll. Splendid return-to-form Woody Allen comedy about a harried writer (Wilson never before so good and nuanced!) dreaming of living in the past â The Golden Age of the '20s â while vacationing in Paris with fiancÃ©e McAdams discovers he actually can at midnite (!) Allen has concocted a potently funny valentine to The City of Lights with his conceit of hobnobbing with the likes of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein et al as a balm to his neuroses with lush cinematography by Darius Khondji and again Wilson's bittersweet, low-key comedic tour de force. Make a reservation now for the year's most sublime comedy!"
"'Set in 1994, Jennifer Aniston is Sarah Huttinger, about 30 and living in NYC. She is traveling home to L.A. for her sister\'s wedding, and bringing her fiancÃ©e Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) with her. This will be Jeff\'s first chance to meet her relatives. One of those relatives is her deceased mother\'s mother (\'don\'t call me grandmother\') Katherine, played capably by the always good Shirley MacLaine.The premise for the movie\'s story is that when back home, Sarah hears some gossip which leads her to believe that her real father is an old friend of her mother\'s, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner). Seems that her mother, grandmother, and Beau were the real people that The Graduate was based on. That perhaps, when Sarah\'s mother disappeared for a few days before her wedding, she became pregnant with Sarah.No, it isn\'t a great movie, but it is enjoyably entertaining.SPOILERS. Beau admits to having slept with grandma and momma back in 1963, but some years earlier he had been injured in a soccer game, kicked in the jewels which rendered him sterile. Turns out, it was Sarah\'s father who had done the kicking! Sarah\'s father was her real father after all, but now Sarah had alienated Jeff by unwisely sleeping with Beau herself, in a moment of great weakness. In the end, Sarah asked for forgiveness, and it looked like she and Jeff would get married after all.'"
"'I can not believe that a lucid person can like this flick, unless a fan of Jennifer Aniston, or Kevin Costner, or Shirley MacLaine, or Mark Ruffalo. The plot is one of the most silly and ridiculous I have ever seen in a movie: Sarah Huttinger heard a rumor that her grandmother might have been the real Mrs. Robinson that inspired the successful movie The Graduate. She decides to investigate the truth and finds that the man that had sex with her grandmother, had also with her mother and in the end she meets him and completes the fate of the women of her family also having sex with the guy. Is it funny? Have I missed some point about this dysfunctional family of whores? This rumor has no humor, is an awful lack of respect with The Graduate and a great disappointment. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Dizem Por Ai (It is Told That)'"

"'In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government. Amity is the cheerfully peaceful farm workers. Candor is honest. Dauntless is the wild brave protector. Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don\'t belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she\'s Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It\'s something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is I don\'t buy this world. Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don\'t buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It\'s not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue.'"
"'Picture this: a post-apocalyptic closed society maintains a series of social strata, but then one young person doesn\'t conform. Sounds like The Hunger Games, doesn\'t it? Well, Divergent also uses this story. I had never heard of this series before the first movie got released. Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind The Hunger Games and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person\'s faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).So, this franchise doesn\'t come across as anything original. I wish that someone would film Kim Stanley Robinson\'s Years of Rice and Salt.'"
"'21 Jump Street was a late 1980s/early 90s action based cop show featuring Johnny Depp. A department of youthful looking cops who can mingle amongst young people.The film version goes for laughs with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing mismatched buddies who get recruited by the newly constituted Jump Street because of their youthful looks and go undercover in High School to break a synthetic drugs gang.On paper the film does not sound much, an old forgotten TV series being revived, starring two actors who outside of the USA would not cause much of a stir, Tatum being widely regarded as Mr Wooden.However the synthetic drug must have been put in these guys coffee as both Hill and Tatum give terrific performances.Tatum shows a talent for light comedy and has signs of a personality which have up to now remained hidden.The script is consistently funny and makes you laugh, the direction is very much spot on. The film does not outstay its welcome and even better, they bag star cameos from an original 21 Jump Street member or two.'"
"'Stark\'s experiences during the alien invasion of New York are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence.Todd McCarthy wrote, After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... that benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. This is spot on. Black brings a sensibility to the table that is perfect for Tony Stark, and recalls the days when Black was writing witty banter for Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.'"
Ben Whittaker (Robert De Niro) is a 70 year old Brooklyn widower and a retired executive from the phone company. His son's family lives out of town. He tries to fill his days of leisure. He spots a flyer advertising internships for senior citizens. It's a fast-paced fashion internet commerce site run by Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway). It's been a hectic 18 months for the married mother of little girl and she is reluctantly forced to use Ben as her assistant. Her husband Matt gave up his job to be the stay-at-home dad. Fiona (Rene Russo) is the company masseuse. Ben befriends everyone until Fiona starts to find him indispensable.Nancy Meyers gets a bad rap as the rom-com has become a passe genre. This is not a rom-com but it is a friend-com. De Niro is a little too perfect as the magical old guy with all the answers and lessons for the young ones. This movie is a bit too neat and clean with the characters. Hathaway is the driven multi-tasking internet executive. The characters may be stock but the actors make them breathe. Some of the side characters have some fun. The big twist (not that surprising) does not really raise the drama although Nancy is trying to say somethings. It all combines to create a nice pairing of these two great actors.
"'I think that the timing of the release of Megamind hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, Despicable Me, which came out shortly before Megamind made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that Despicable Me stole Megamind\'s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.So what\'s my verdict? Well, frankly I think both films are about equally good but have a slightly different audience. Despicable Me is clearly marketed more to kids and has cuteness as its advantage. The minions from Despicable Me are magnificent and adorable. It\'s also a tad formulaic--but not bad at all despite the predictability. Megamind, however, is more a film for teens and adults--as cuteness is not really something I\'d associate with the movie. It also has a few more surprises and a more adult sense of humor. My wife and oldest daughter preferred Megamind while I preferred Despicable Me--but we all agreed that both were really nice films.I could say a lot more about the film, but since it\'s now out on DVD and already has a ton of reviews, I\'ll pass. Suffice to say it\'s well worth seeing and is excellent entertainment.'"
"To all shy freshman out there: You're certainly better off being introverted, especially after you see this rather odd film.Taken under the wing of two seniors in high school, our hero is a withdrawn young lad who craves for attention and is involved with his friend, better commonly known as his diary.This is certainly not your coming of age film. Dylan McDermott, as the father, and Ms. Cusack, who portrays the mother, have relatively little to do in the film.A wallflower would not have this kind of life. At least, our hero develops somewhat of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, though it is quite weird, which best describes the entire film.After the other two graduate and go off to college, our hero breaks down and we soon can guess what really happened to his aunt and what she had down to him.His course of therapy in the film is minimized. It would have been better to focus on the problem that drove him to an institution and to see his cure develop. Instead, he is cured too quickly."
"Mostly a trite and clichÃ©d high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit clichÃ©, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it)."
"The Chronicles of Narnia is based on the novels by author C.S. Lewis. The four Pevensie siblings are evacuated from London escaping the blitz. They discover a magical wardrobe which is a gateway to Narnia.It's been a long time since I read the books. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. The big complaint I have is the annoying, dumb, bickering, whiny, and unlikeable kids especially Edmund. It makes it hard to root for them. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) looks like he's always on the verge of an evil plan. Lucy (Georgie Henley) is a yappy little thing. And the two older ones (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell) can't stop bickering.Tilda Swinton overplays the evil White Witch early on. She is so evil that it becomes unreasonable that Edmund couldn't see. It is idiotic. She would be better off playing nicer at the start. The good part is the world of Narnia. It does the job. It has the feel of a slightly magical otherly world that is still reminiscent of the real world. The CGI looks good. With all the different creatures, they look realistic enough."
"Tale of children sent away to avoid the bombings of World War 11 England only to find utter mayhem in an enchanted land.Coincidentally, the children are supposed to be the ultimate liberators from The White Queen. The latter, played by Tilda Swinton, is as eerie as my high school chemistry teacher. She holds a sword like a true clod.Jim Broadbent, a fine actor, is utterly wasted here as the man whose house they have gone to only to find a rear closet whose back door reveals this land in turmoil.It's almost like a David and Goliath tale with modern Hollywood technical achievements."

"'It\'s always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn\'t really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It\'s not real? Isn\'t a movie not real by definition? So if you really criticize something about this movie, let it be the story (or parts of it), that just don\'t work out quite as well. But as with most thrillers, the movie picks up pace, so that you don\'t have time to think about a few things, that really shouldn\'t be happening. But again, starting to pick too much on those things, why go watch the movie in the first place? I knew what I was going to get and it was more or less what I expected. I was kinda surprised to see that many nationalities on screen. Woody H. was quite funny, although not fully used (imo). So despite quite a few things that didn\'t work (always in the context of the movie), you can have some fun with this.'"
"'Readers of the Suzanne Collins novels we not overjoyed to have Mockingjay to be split into two parts; but that is movie business. Squeeze every drop out of a product you can. Dragged-out and anti-climatic, but yet loud, lavish and albeit entertaining. The main thing in common to quantify success is Miss Jennifer Lawrence.My favorite and probably best sequence in MOCKINGJAY - Part 2, features Katniss(Lawrence)and a selected band of rebels tromping through subterranean sewers of the capitol, when they are attacked by ghostly white and slimy lizard mutts. Katniss is warned not to trust anyone. The whole intent of this episode is to conclude the revolution by dethroning and killing the tyrannical President Snow(Donald Sutherland). The finale may be a tad bittersweet and less fulfilling than hoped. But the Hunger Games have ended.Credit Peter Craig and Danny Strong for the adapted screenplay and kudos to director Francis Lawrence. Jeniffer Lawrence earned and deserves any and all accolades thrown at her feet. She is THE HUNGER GAMES. An astounding supporting cast features: Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Jullianne Moore, Mahershala Ali, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci.'"
"Gothel uses a magical flower to remain young. The king's men discovers the flower and uses it to cure the sick pregnant queen. The queen recovers to give birth to Rapunzel with the golden hair. Rapunzel's hair turns out to have the same property as the flower. Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel raising her as her own daughter, keeping her hidden away in a tower, and using her hair to keep young. The king and queen launch lighted floating lanterns every year on the baby's birthday. As she grows into a teenager, Rapunzel pines for the outside world. Bandit Flynn Ryder is on the run from the authorities. He tries to hide in the tower, and Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan. She makes a deal to release him if he guides her to the floating lights that she sees on her birthday every year.I like the story, and I like the two lead characters. They're cute and funny together. The animation looks pretty. I just wish they have a comedic third wheel that isn't a voiceless chameleon. I wish they have a good comedian to bring some outlandish joking around. I also wish the tunes were catchier. Little kids should be singing it in the car to annoy the parents. They've got a singer in Mandy Moore, but they don't have a good song for her to sing. Nevertheless, it's pretty fun little comedy."
"'John Carpenter directed this low budget classic horror film.Carpenter also provides an irritating slasher style soundtrack that is louder than the dialogue.The film opens with a young boy called Michael killing his sister in Halloween. It then goes forward 15 years when Michael has escaped his mental hospital.Hot on his heels is the psychiatrist, Doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance) convinced that Michael will kill again.Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the young babysitter who along with her friends are being stalked by Michael.Carpenter builds tension slowly along with some gratuitous topless scenes of teenage girls. He creates a creepy atmosphere with the Halloween paraphernalia.The television is showing the movie The Thing from Another World, a movie Carpenter would go on to remake. More importantly he has a genuine heroine in peril in Jamie Lee Curtis.The killings are horrific but less bloodthirsty than modern movies. In Michael Myers he also has an indestructible killer, The Boogeyman who never stays dead. Handy for all future sequels.'"

"'In a full moon night of a Friday, 13th, the instructors of Camp Crystal Lake are murdered, one by one, in a night of terror. In the end of the story, a convincing explanation clarifies what have happened. This cult movie was very original and spooky in 1980. Placed basically in one location and with unknown young actors and actresses, it was indeed a successful low budget movie, copied many times in other films. Today I have just watched it again, now on a recently released DVD, and it is still good to see. I regret the sequels, since the story is very well resolved in a credible way without supernatural. This way, it is much more terrifying and could have stopped right here. My vote is seven.'"

"I often struggle with Jack Nicholson, finding his distinctive off-screen persona so evident in his acting that it's hard to for me to accept the bloke as anyone but himself. Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a characterânot even for the Joker.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the man calling the shots behind the camera was one of the finest film-makers to have ever livedâStanley Kubrick; if anyone could get a convincing performance from Nicholson, it was going to be Stan. With an unforgettable central turn from its star and flawless direction from Kubrick, The Shining is one of the best horrors of all time, offering stunning camera-work, unsettling music, iconic visuals, and scene upon scene of unbridled suspense and terror. In fact, it's so scary that I find I can even overlook (pun intended) Shelley Duvall's freakishly large eyes and scary teeth, and that's saying something!"
"'it is his movie. and that fact is obvious in each scene. in tempo, in manner to build the fear, in the outdoor scenes, in the indoor scenes. more than a horror, a not most expected adaptation, it is a film by a clockmaker. each detail, each dialog, each line of terror, the expectation itself are the result of carefully manner to use the book in the best form as tool of personal vision. Jack Nicholson is the cause to remind this horror again and again. but his performance is only the top of a film who has strong, deep roots in social tensions. and that fact does it more than one of the most impressive adaptations of Stephen King.'"
"'Well, everybody knows that The Rocky Horror Picture Show is probably the ultimate cult classic; at this point, RHPS isn\'t even really a cult movie anymore, due to its prominence. The plot (or whatever it is) of course has Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) going to a castle run by the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a transvestite from transsexual Transylvania. Mostly, the movie seems like a big excuse to be weird, and they do just that to great effect. And who ever would have guessed that Susan Sarandon, now known for serious roles, could do such a cool job singing? So, was RHPS trying to tell us anything? Who cares? It\'s just so neat that you just have to sit back and enjoy. And enjoy you will, even if you think that nothing good came out of the \'70s (I, for one, don\'t hold that opinion).'"
"'Despite my score of 3 for The Rocky Horror Picture Show, I am NOT saying it is a film to avoid. If you have a theater nearby that allows audience participation (a MUST) or if your local community theater is putting on the play, by all means go! After all, this is a great story to watch with friends and the participation portion can be a lot of fun. But, on its own, it\'s a film that shocks but isn\'t particularly good. A few of the songs are nice but the plot just leaves me flat and the acting, at times, is pretty amateurish. No masterpiece...but it can be fun if seen with like-minded friends.'"
"'....but it would not be Ian Fleming\'s saga for long.The first four films used to follow the novels -with the exception of thunderball which ,although close to the book,actually came from an original screenplay:hence its remake in 1983-,then the following episodes only kept the titles...And when there were no more titles ,the script writers had to invent new ones ,Ã\xa0 la Ian Fleming (Goldeneye,etc).The first four Bond were arguably the best and it\'s always interesting to compare them with the books,which we cannot do anymore from you only live twice onwards.At the time ,the writers were timid self-conscious guys;they did not dare to include the crabs scene:Honeychile \'s naked body is handed over to big crabs!Two years later,they would not be afraid to show Jill Masterton \'s golden girl scene ,even if that scene was only told by another character (Tilly Masterton)in the novel.Dr No is still tentative ,but compared to what the saga became later,it is commendable stuff.'"
"'My summary line is true in so many ways - not just with the very (in)famous scene that kicks everything off. And why does it happen? Of course because of a missunderstood call to begin with - but the other one is Quarantine rules broken! Now if you read this during the 2020 pandemic ... yes I know quite disturbing and eerie. Also fodder for memes - at least for one that I have seen with the complete crew of the Nostromo.If you have issues with closed space, get paranoia and have problems with technology getting ahead of us ... well the movie will not do much to relieve you from them. Claustrophobia can be quite draining - but the set design here ... not even thinking about the low budget, this has aged quite well. What hasn\'t aged to well are the communication devices (same is true for the sequel). But that is really a small part of the whole experience. The special effects are amazing, the not seeing the Alien suspense much also works.This is a classic and something that while I\'ve heard people call boring, is quite the opposite. Edge of your seat and a cast that is superb, an amazing script and many things just working for it. There is a reason this spawned so many sequels and it is also just great to have a female lead that is as strong as it gets.'"
"'Halloween 2 (2009): Dir: Rob Zombie / Cast: Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris, Sheri Moon Zombie: Starts off where the first film left off just as the original Halloween 2 began where the original Halloween left off. Director Rob Zombie takes a different path by going ahead a few years and using only the first act to reference the substantial hospital scenes in the original Halloween 2. This is effective because in the original sequel, Myers is reduced to a zombie like stalker in hospital corridors. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis survives the attacks from the previous film but unlike Donald Pleasence, he turns the character into a fame seeker selling his book about his encounters. This adds some humour as well as critical reception when he is accused of exploiting the murders. How Loomis is ultimately dealt with is another lame and graphic encounter with Myers. Scout Taylor-Compton as victim Laurie Stroud is given more to do. The Sheriff finds her that night and after extreme therapy she is living with him and his daughter Annie. She discovers her birth right before she ultimately visits a Smiths Grove. Brad Dourif plays the Sheriff while Danielle Harris plays his rebellious ill fated daughter. Sheri Moon Zombie appears briefly as mother Myers leading a white horse about. Visually well made alteration of the original sequel. Score: 4 Â½ / 10'"
"'Rob Zombie at the helm, writing, directing and co-producing this follow-up to his 2007 HALLOWEEN. The story isn\'t much compared to the original franchise; but it is brutally violent and grisly. Special effects are first rate for being gruesome. This film just seems to be a lumbering mess. Zombie\'s wife Sheri Moon Zombie reprises her role as Deborah Myers. Its that time again to trick-or-treat in Haddonfield, Illinois, where psycho Michael Myers(Tyler Maine) left unexplained carnage. Mean Mike breaks out of the institution, not before he leaves a bloody mess. He has urgent needs to return home to finish up on some family business. His sister(Ms. Zombie) is still there as well as his surviving victim Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton). To capitalize on the infamous holiday, Michael\'s doctor Samuel Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is in town to plug his new book. As expected Halloween will once again be bloody.I\'m not real fond of the White Horse aspect nor the visions of little Michael and his mother; they could have been left out entirely. Plus the F word was way over-used. And the actress playing Laurie is so bad and irritating, you could care less how long she survived. Also starring are: Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, with smaller roles for Margot Kidder, Howard Hesseman and Bill Fagerbakke.'"
"'Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in The Departed, he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem.The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction.The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor.The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops.The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.'"
"Disconcertingly glum 007 entry with George Lazenby attempting to fill Sean Connery's shoes as the super-smooth secret agent (this was his only James Bond outing). Bond falls in love with a troubled Contessa while tracking nemesis Blofeld (Telly Savalas) from the Swiss Alps. The action sequences are nicely spread about by director Peter R. Hunt, whose work unfortunately goes slack for the romantic drama. One simply fails to believe James Bond in this affair of the heart--and when he chats with old friend Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), it seems absurd that she should treat him just as she always has (maybe it's the job and not the man she's secretly smitten with?). Certainly there are unusual ingredients here for a 007 adventure, but it doesn't quite click. Terrific music score by John Barry, fine cinematography and amazing stunt work. As for Lazeneby: he's down-to-earth and handsome enough, but bland. ** from ***"
"'My mom said that when The Exorcist first came out, she thought that it was the scariest thing that she\'d ever seen (The Shining later overtook it). When I saw the 2000 re-release...well, let\'s just say that you don\'t know intensity until you\'ve seen that version! Since everyone knows what happens, I\'ll just talk about a few aspects. Nowadays, it\'s a little shocking to us that the opening scene happens in Iraq. Fr. Karras\' (Jason Miller) first name is Damian, which was later the boy\'s name in The Omen. I believe that it was around the time when this movie came out that Ellen Burstyn was active in the campaign to free Rubin Hurricane Carter from jail. Linda Blair later spoofed her own character in Repossessed, co-starring Leslie Nielsen. Anyone hungry for pea soup?'"
"'This movie was a treat to the eye, and that was about where the hype ended for me. The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at.The story, the plot, the characters? Well, they were taken straight out of a how to make a Hollywood action movie book. There was nothing here that haven\'t been seen in a bunch of other movies. Actually, Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the Battle for Terra animated movie. Everything in this movie is clichÃ© and seen countless other times. I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie, but once you sit down and watch it, you will go hmmm, I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else...Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone, this movie would be a top score, but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks - it needs depth and a solid story. This is where Avatar fell apart.And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda. That was just hilarious! Overall, the movie takes you in for a thrillride of spectacular colors and effects, and provides mediocre entertainment story- and plotwise.I was left with a sense of disappointment from this movie. It could have been so much more than a mediocre thrillride.'"
"'This movie was a treat to the eye, and that was about where the hype ended for me. The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at.The story, the plot, the characters? Well, they were taken straight out of a how to make a Hollywood action movie book. There was nothing here that haven\'t been seen in a bunch of other movies.

'I like the bit with the man and the golden gun that he had'
"'Premonition had all the elements for being a great thriller, but it ended up as a somewhat mediocre mess. The jumping around days part was interesting, but it was ultimately the director who killed the potential of Premonition.Normally I do like the performances in movies by Sandra Bullock, but she was way off in Premonition. I didn\'t buy into her performance as a woman who had just lost her husband and the father of their daughters. It was like she wasn\'t fully there mentally, and that absent performance weighed down on the movie in overall. Julian McMahon did a good enough job as the husband and father.I was disappointed with the mediocrity of the movie, because I must admit that I had expected much more from a movie with Bullock and McMahon in the lead roles.The movie was also a bit shallow. The part with the affair in the making was just brought up briefly and then brushed well clear off the table. The characters could have used a bit more depth and background.All in all, not an overly impressive or memorable thriller. This is not a movie at the top of the recommendation list if you want to watch a good thriller.'"
"'Jittery, solemn melodrama, a would-be thriller, casts Sandra Bullock as a businessman\'s wife and the mother of two who seems to be living a tumultuous week out of sequence: one day she\'s being told her husband has perished in a car accident, the next morning she wakes to find him in the kitchen. It\'s nearly impossible (and useless) to pick apart screenwriter Bill Kelly\'s shuffled format when that format is the film\'s entire agenda, however certain sections of the movie simply do not gel (Bullock being accused of hurting her daughter and dragged out of her home by an imposing psychiatrist--she doesn\'t know what happened, but that doesn\'t mean everyone else should be in the dark). There\'s a bracing quality to the theme of the picture--do we attempt to stop fatal events from happening if we have an inkling of their outcome?--but that nearly gets lost here, mostly due to the writing; Kelly has created a group of stony characters who enter and exit rooms in a flash without proper communication. Good acting and technical values, but frustration builds instead of suspense. Premonition feels blunted, and one can sense director Mennan Yapo\'s indecision, particularly at the final gate which is just a passel of former scenes. **1/2 from ****'"
"For many 'The Holiday' has joined the ranks of Christmas classic's in terms of films. I wish them well with this but for me this is an average film that is made marginally better by an all-star cast, who seem to be having a better time than the audience.It's trying to be like 'Love Actually', it's trying to be sweet and romantic, but in the end I just didn't buy into Jack Black's character, or the one played by Kate Winslet.It has it's moments, but for me they are far and few between in an overly long film that could've been over and done with in 90 minutes tops.But it's Christmas, we are kinder to films that are trying to entertain us. Even if this one tries too hard."
"OK, let's get the gripes out of the way first: Vaio, Google, Telegraph - product placement has rarely been so shamelessly placed in your face as it is in this romantic comedy that would have you believe it is a throwback to all those romantic comedies from the vintage years of Hollywood. Second gripe - Cary Grant was born in Bristol, a city in the county of Avon, some distance from the county of Surrey.The good things about this movie are that Kate Winslet, as always, is a hugely likable character (it's just a shame she felt the need to slim down about ten years ago); the sub-plot involving Eli Wallach's ageing scriptwriter, which is easily the most interesting strand of the film; and the fact that Jack Black is only 90% as annoying as he usually is and Jude Law acquits himself quite well as the romantic lead.Women will probably love this film; it's unashamedly, unrealistically romantic with a happy ending. Men will probably hate it - there's not an explosion or fist-fight in sight..."
"'In the Ian Fleming novels, James Bond was not super-human nor did he run around with tons of ridiculous gadgets. He was more a spy and assassin--not a guy with amazing powers. While I loved DR. NO and FROM Russia WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER is a sad film for me because it ushered in a trend in Bond films that I disliked--ridiculous gadgetry that got in the way of plot. Sure, it was fun watching Oddjob throwing his metallic hat, but it also was pretty stupid if you think about it. Additionally, having Goldfinger use a laser on Bond was just dumb. Like Dr. Evil\'s son suggests in the Austin Powers film, why not just put a bullet in his head and be done with it?!?! If you take away all the gadgets, the rest of the movie is very good and very exciting. Thanks to a long film with lots of twists and turns, it felt like a real adventure--very escapist and satisfying.By the way, in the book, Pussy Galore was clearly a lesbian and Bond was so hyper-manly that he somehow got her to change her sexual orientation. This aspect was cleaned up since audiences in 1964 were not ready to see a lesbian major character. In the film, it\'s only hinted at and Ms. Galore seemed like she was more hard to get than anything else. Wow,...what a name for a character!'"
"A musical score and song generally can make or break a film. Such is the case for From Russia With Love. This 1963 film has a haunting theme which can never be forgotten.Sean Connery, always fabulous as the sexy James Bond, is at it again. He is just masterful in the role of the darling British Agent up to his neck in intrigue and usual suspense.Acting kudos must go to veteran actress Lotte Lenya, widow of legend Kurt Weill, for her performance as a major player in the evil organization of Spectre. As Rosa Klebb, Ms. Lenya was the embodiment of evil. She'd sell her soul to the highest paying devil. As wicked and ugly as they come, who can ever forget her knife in the shoe final scene climax. She takes a bullet to the chest and collapses against that wall in true Hollywood fashion."
"In memory of Sir Sean Connery, I and Mom decided to watch this-the second James Bond film and one considered a favorite of Connery as well as a few others associated with the series. My mom had mentioned seeing this before when she lived in the Philippines but when watching, she didn't remember any of it! I remember some of the scenes-like on the train-when it showed on ABC during the late '70s, but then the TV screen was green-tinted so it wasn't very clear as it was when we watched part of it on DVD and the rest-because the DVD stopped for some reason-on Amazon Prime. I'll just now say this took some time but gradually, this film got more exciting as it went on toward the end. Especially when that fight with Bond and Rosa Klebb was going on! So on that note, From Russia with Love is still a great James Bond flick!"
"'Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.As two magicians, one\'s mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman\'s wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show The Nanny. Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don\'t run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening.'"
'I like it when they said. I have a bad feeling about this'
"'Some movies just confuse me. They have fabulous reputations but I find them difficult to like due to their excessive and pointless violence. Well, I may just be out of touch, since this movie is in the top 50 on IMDb ratings. However, I also worry that this film and other ultra-violent films like SCARFACE (the Pacino version) are adored by so many. We live in a violent world--that\'s a fact. And, I wonder how much of that violence is either exacerbated by it or it encourages good people to become desensitized to violence or even find it exciting. I hope to think I am better than that.Now I am not saying that there weren\'t some really good elements to the movie and it was very well made. But, the film is so thoroughly soaked in violence and human waste that the good is grossly overshadowed. Just because the people De Niro kills at the end are bad guys doesn\'t mean it is entertaining or less offensive. Regardless, these sort of films are not something I enjoy.'"
"Teenagers Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) and Danny (John Travolta) have a summer romance but that seems to be how long it will last. Then they discover that they now both attend the same high school...Good musical-drama. Basic plot, but the movie is made by the music. Catchy, and keeps the story moving along.Decent performance by John Travolta. Olivia Newton-John is weak and unconvincing in her role though. Supporting cast is solid, though casting in general is a major problem. Who thought casting 20-somethings as teens when they don't look anything like teens would be a good idea? Doesn't help the plausibility."

"'it could be the best motif to see Grease. a so familiar song is the right invitation to discover a legendary musical. the second - Sandy and Danny couple. who remains inspired image of the high school love story. but Grease is more than a nice film. or, only, a legendary one. it is example of smart story, wise use of clichÃ©s and admirable music. and this is the start point. for see one of the most fresh films. because it preserves the spirit of a period. and reflects the feelings of an unique age. because it is a film about vulnerability, courage, entertainment and joy. a story. who seems be perfect.'"
"John Travolta is coming off his Vinnie Barbarino persona. He mugs for the camera. He plays the dummy too often. He is totally a child of peer pressure. I end up thinking, I don't really give a damn if the two of them ever get together. Does anyone else care. The movie is lightweight, but it never takes itself seriously anyway. It's a series of really great songs and interactions, primarily among the hoodlum element of the fifties (who seem to be the standard bearers of that time, even though most kids weren't part of that culture). The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter). I was surprised that Travolta is a pretty decent singer."
"'You must have heard the raves...the best Sequel of all time, well, Star Wars Fans may disagree but it is a valid argument. This surpasses a Great Film with an even greater Film. It is certainly broader in Scope and even more lavish in its Production. The Flashback New York Scenes are a standout.The warm, rich Cinematography remain and the sharp Characters with a wider palette to add even more richness to proceedings. It is more edgy and is less likely to linger with Portrait like introductions to already known participants. There are more interesting themes here like the expansion to Las Vegas, and the formation of the Family\'s Patriarch and sensibilities, and the Senate Hearings.This one moves quite a bit faster than the original because it has much more to say. It says it and then some. Michael\'s descent into internal Madness is not a pretty sight and the Inheritor to all that is Corleone becomes a very unlikable Tyrant and shows virtually no signs of Humanity as the Modernity of events that take place have no place for that sort of thing.'"
"The movie was far better during the first hour when we see a very good boy, his poor widowed mother, both of whom are taking care of bedridden grandparents. They're caught up in this business of finding the golden ticket to the chocolate factory.As far as I'm concerned, the picture deteriorates with the boy finding one of the 5 tickets and his visit to the chocolate factory with grandfather Jack Albertson and some of the most obnoxious other children who get what they deserve at the visit.The tunes are delightful and was that really Jack Albertson singing? The film goes to show you that kindness is ultimately rewarded and selfishness does not go unpunished.The ending in itself proves that chocolate factory owner was sly, but a real child himself at heart."
"'James Bond (Sean Connery) heads to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme.Of all the James Bond films, this one has one of the less-notable Bond girls. After passing on Julie Christie and Raquel Welch, we end up with Claudine Auger as Dominique Domino Derval. The character of Domino is interesting, but Auger is hardly well known. (Though fans of Italian horror may recognize her for Mario Bava\'s Twitch of the Death Nerve.) Sean Connery is the definitive Bond, and this film shows us why. He is smooth and chats up the ladies in ways that no other Bond has. Sorry, Roger Moore. But it is the case.'"
"The fourth Bond film sees the criminal organisation SPECTRE trying to pull off its greatest coupÂ to steal two nuclear weapons and hold the west to ransom. To do this one of their agents is given plastic surgery so that he looks like a NATO officer who will fly aboard an RAF Vulcan bomber. The plot probably would have worked but for the fact that Bond just happened to be undergoing some enforced relaxation at the clinic the work was done at and saw the real officer dead. The only lead is his sister Domino; she is in the Bahamas so that is Bond's destination. Here he finds her living with Largo; Bond is sure that he is involved but proving it won't be easy.This Bond film is filled with all the thrills one would expect; underwater fights, explosions, a pool full of sharks, several beautiful women and some great one-liners. The numerous undersea scenes were great particularly impressive was the final confrontation between Largo's men and the US forces summoned by Bond's CIA friend Felix Lieter. Sean Connery was once again great as Bond and Adolfo Celi was good as the villain Largo and Claudine Auger did a decent job as Domino."
"'There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.'"
"I never quite understood why the old pirates got so ticked off at the town. It was through their own bumbling that everything happened. Then, of course, we have the old legend and the festival and people who can't see their hands in front of them (fog joke). Of course, most of us wake up every morning thinking that the pea soup stuff we see occasionally has as its consequence making the drive to work uncomfortable, even dangerous. We don't know that eye patch and peg leg are in there working their many charms. I don't mean to be harsh, but a good ghost story needs proper exposition to provide us with a palpable threat. The foundation is hokum and it just didn't work for me."
"Both US and USSR are developing miniaturization technology. Dr. Michaels (Donald Pleasence) is attacked riding in an American military convoy. He, agent Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd), pilot Captain Bill Owens (William Redfield), surgeon Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch) are gathered for a special mission. Soviet defector Jan Benes developed technology to shrink indefinitely for the USSR while the US can only do it for 60 minutes. Jan Benes is in a coma after a failed assassination attempt and the group is miniaturized in a special submarine to destroy his brain clot.The start is a little slow and maybe that's why there's an action scene at the beginning. While the movie is old fashion, it is filmed expertly with energy. The first act has a lot of exposition work for the actors to get thru which does slow it down. The methodical miniaturization process is not quite thrilling enough. Once the sub goes into the body, the adventure begins. These are top notch special effects for its day. The designs are good. The submarine does restrict the action to some extend. Nevertheless, this is an old fashion sci-fi classic and it introduced Raquel Welch to many hot-blooded males. I would definitely help rip off those attacking cells for her."
"At the time of release, I was crazy about FANTASTIC VOYAGE. Seeing it again, years later, there are lots of reservations but it still deserves a huge amount of credit for the overall originality of the plot wherein a group of scientists are turned into microscopic size in order to be injected into the body of a Czech scientist whose brain must be saved from a blood clot.It's an inside look at the lungs, ears and other assorted arteries of the upper body as the scientists attempt their mission in a one hour span because after that they revert to normal size. Needless to say, what they thought might be a ten minute salvage operation turns out to be much more perilous and time consuming. Once inside the body, the story evolves in real time, so the suspense is heightened.Some nifty players do their best to make it all seem convincing and, on the whole, they do a creditable job. That includes RAQUEL WELCH, ARTHUR KENNEDY, DONALD PLEASANCE and STEPHEN BOYD. Unfortunately, the story moves a little too slowly, a factor which modern audiences will probably find detrimental to this kind of tale.Summing up: May not be quite as satisfying for today's audiences who have seen everything in the way of science fiction, but in its time it was considered quite original and won Oscars for art decoration and special effects."
"Fantastic Voyage boasted great special effects for its day. It also is a neat fantasy thriller being a race against the clock with a saboteur on board.Agent Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd) has been bought in fo a secret mission. Jan Benes is a scientist who has been injured while escaping from Russia. He has a blood clot on the brain.In order to save Benes life. American scientists will miniaturize a nuclear submarine, inject it into Benes' body and fix the clot. They have 60 minutes to do this before the submarine returns to its normal size.Grant is warned that the surgeon Dr Duval might also be an assassin. Once they get inside the body, it is a bumpy ride and nothing seems to go according to plan.Director Richard Fleischer manages to stay on the right side of camp. The film takes a while to get going but once inside the body, it is a nicely crafted and well paced movie with lots of suspense.Raquel Welch is suitable eye candy. The special effects as the submarine goes through the bloodstream has a psychedelic touch. It is just a shame that the villain is a little too obvious."
"'NATIONAL LAMPOON\'S ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) **** John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, John Vernon, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst, Donald Sutherland, Karen Allen, James Widdoes, Bruce McGill, Sarah Holcomb, Verna Bloom, Otis Day & the Knights, Kevin Bacon.  Classic comedy about college life circa 1960s that made Belushi a superstar in his most memorable and iconic role: \'professional\' undergrad/uberslob frat pig Bluto Blutarsky, the hard-drinking, frantic and fun-loving heart and soul of Delta House, a broken-down fringe fraternity sect out to make Dean Wormer (Vernon perfectly square-jawed authoritarian s.o.b.) resort to placing them under double secret probation resulting in their ultimate retribution: TOGA! TOGA! TOGA! Fast and furiously funny and directed with breakneck elan by John Landis, nostalgic and crazy with some memorable moments including: shooting an R.O.T.C.  horse in the dean\'s office; Hulce\'s angel and devil arguing over a drunken opportunity; Belushi\'s advice to Furst after his frat brothers demolish his older sibling\'s prized car: My advice to you is...start drinking heavily; Belushi\'s film vault moment: the food fight of cinema history; the dean\'s credo: Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life; and my personal favorite lines: And For God\'s sake tuck in those pajamas! by the neo-Nazi Niedermeyer to Flounder and Nothing\'s over! Was it over when the German\'s bombed Pearl Harbor?! by Bluto in his rousing the frat rats to war with Omega!'"
"A diamond smuggling investigation leads James Bond (Sean Connery) to Las Vegas, where he uncovers an evil plot involving a rich business tycoon.While this is not the greatest Bond film, and some have said it is a sad farewell to Sean Connery, it does have its moments. For one, we have Q as a thief. I suppose being a spy agency's gadget man gives you some leeway, but I don't think you are supposed to steal from slot machines! As far as Bond girls go, Jill St. John is probably on the top half of a list running from best to worst. Strangely enough, I know her more as a mob moll than a Bond girl. Which makes the film's setting in Vegas all the more interesting."
"Ever since Mike Myers mercilessly mocked You Only Live Twice in Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, it's been impossible to take this particular Bond adventure seriously; but to be honest, the film was always pretty ridiculous in the first place, stretching plausibility further than ever before in an effort to up the ante in terms of crowd-pleasing spectacle.The basic plot is solid enoughâSPECTRE steals US and Russian spacecraft in a bid to start a war that will turn Japan into the world's leading superpowerâbut the excess of silliness on display virtually turns this into self-parody. A giant lair, complete with monorail, hidden inside a volcano; a ninja army; Little Nellie, a stupid looking auto-gyro that proves unbeatable in an aerial battle against four regular helicopters; Bond posing as a Japanese fisherman: all a far cry from the rawness of the first two Connery movies (no surprise then that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, author of many a classic book for kids).As a fan of all things Japanese, I enjoy the setting, the karate, and the women, and Blofeld's piranha filled pool is a cool touch (every self-respecting megalomaniac should have one), but its not at all surprising that You Only Live Twice marked the end for Connery as Bond (at least for a while), the star being replaced by George Lazenby for the secret agent's next adventure."
"'Albert R. Broccoli sneaked into George Lucas\' backyard--outer space--with director Lewis Gilbert on the eleventh James Bond epic Moonraker, the absolutely most outlandish 007 thriller ever made. Basically, Moonraker was an overblown version of Goldfinger with an audacious battle sequence at the end with Space Marines storming a space station established by the ambitious villain. All Bond movies are essentially alike, being stitched together with episodes from other Bonds. Hugo Drax steals a space shuttle on loan to the United States from Britain and M dispatches 007 to investigate. The pre-credit sequence where Bond performs a free-fall without a parachute is one of the best in franchise. Later, when Bond is strapped into the gravity simulator, he emerges looking pretty wiped out. The scene is the most realistic of any Roger Moore Bond. The gondola scene in Venice is rather far out and goes over the top later when Bond\'s gondola becomes hovercraft. Jaws who had menaced Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me returned but he was no longer a villain as he joined sides with 007. Moonraker ranks as one of John Barry\'s best orchestral scores, especially the bits during the theft of the space shuttle at the beginning. The riff on The Magnificent Seven in South America is cool as well as the monastery that serves as a training ground for spies. One of Q\'s coolest gadgets is the sleeping sombrero clad fellow who turns out to be shell concealing a machine gun. Lots of fun!'"
"'Apart from the terrible VIEW TO A KILL, I think this is the very worst Roger Moore James Bond film. Most of the blame was on the insistence in having Jaws reappear in this film. Although there were many Bond fans who loved him and he was tolerable in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, he was an embarrassingly stupid character that demeaned the series. I have read all the Bond books and I understand that in most cases the movies only borrow the titles from the original books, but in this case the entire spirit of Bond is gone and the thrust in on gadgets, a stupid villain and sexual innuendos like calling Bond\'s love interest Dr. Goodhead--wow, what a surprise he actually got some nooky from THIS lady. In general, the movie is like a Bevis and Butthead interpretation of Bond.'"
"'CASINO ROYALE, a 1967 spoof of the whole James Bond spy genre, has to be one of the messiest films ever made. A troubled production leads to a very troubled picture in which new meaning is brought to the phrase scattershot. This is a film filled with extremely broad comedy, touches of surreal humour, and a general lack of both cohesion and coherence so that for most of the running time you\'re wondering what the hell you\'re watching.The storyline only loosely follows that of the Fleming novel, despite the misleading title. Orson Welles has a few scenes as Le Chiffre, for example, but what happens to him is totally out of left field. Meanwhile, we get a storyline involving a past-his-prime David Niven as an elderly Bond who recruits various newcomers to the fold, including a poor Peter Sellers. An appears-in-anything Ursula Andress is the crumpet, while the supporting cast in this bloated production is packed with cameoing stars like Deborah Kerr, John Huston, William Holden, and even one Woody Allen playing \'Jimmy Bond\'.CASINO ROYALE has an episodic structure that is generally hard to watch as most of the supposed funny bits are anything but. The stuff set in Scotland is completely interminable, for example, although things do pick up a little for the more traditional climax. It\'s still one hell of a mess though, worth watching only so you can wonder how they got it so wrong.'"
"An unintentionally hilarious disco dancing scene featuring scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis is the improbable highlight of this early '80s slasher, which gives some idea of just how disappointing Prom Night is as a horror movie, the film achieving nowhere near the level of carefully crafted scares to be found in Curtis's classic genre outing Halloween, nor delivering the exploitative thrills of its far more gory contemporary Friday the 13th.Just about as formulaic and predictable as the genre gets, Prom Night sees a killer bumping off a group of oversexed teenagers who were responsible for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. Who could the murderer be? The weirdo working as a handyman at the high school? The disfigured sex offender originally blamed for the girl's death? The dead girl's father (played by Leslie Nielsen) Or someone else? Seriously, it's not hard to figure out who killer is, so the film doesn't even work as a whodunit. No atmosphere, very little splatter (a decapitation is the only decent death; the rest is too dark to make out), the barest minimum of T&A, a simple to solve mystery, and Jamie Lee grooving it up on the disco floor: hardly the stuff that nightmares are made of.4.5 out of 10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"'This movie begins with a young girl named Robin Hammond (Tammy Bourne) venturing into an old building to join some other kids playing hide-and-seek. However, when the other children discover that she has joined them they decide to have a little fun by scaring her. This results in her accidentally falling out of the building and to her death. Scared that they might get in trouble with the police all four of them swear never to tell what happened and run back to their homes. Six years later each of them are now seniors in high school and on prom night they each receive a strange telephone call that none of them know how to interpret. And then the killings start. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this was one of the first of the films that helped start the slasher craze of the 80\'s along with Halloween and Friday the 13th. Yet, although it was certainly popular when it first came out, it seems to have lost its vitality since then. Even so, I liked the performance of Eddie Benton (as Wendy Richards) along with the way the mystery of the killer was kept until the very end. In any case, I rate this movie as about average.'"
"Little kids play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent and cause the death of little Robin Hammond. Six years later, Kelly Lynch, Jude Cunningham, Wendy Richards and Nick McBride are in Alexander Hamilton Senior High School hiding the secret of that day. Mr. Hammond (Leslie Nielsen) principal of the school, his wife and their kids Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Alex still mourn the lost. Some creep is calling the four kids and threatening their prom night. Nick is going with Kim to the prom. Meanwhile the police suspects sex offender Leonard Merch killed Robin and hounded him to a fiery crash. He turned catatonic but has just escaped from the mental hospital.This is a Canadian B-movie horror. It's not completely horrible as some other low budget productions of that genre. However one would be kidding to claim this to be a good movie. It does have Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. That's the good part but everybody else is at least a step down. The police part is a waste of time. Overall, there isn't anything interesting. The other kids aren't compelling. The dialog is really clunky at times. It may be only my problem but I suffered through some bad lighting. There are whole sections of near total darkness. The disco is pretty cheesy. This is a generally inferior product."
"I saw it when it came to America in 1980 and was almost banned in Boston. I had just turned 18 and was curious so I went to see it. YUCK!!!! This movie was truly sick. Castration, disembowelment, mutilation, beheadings, bestiality, necrophilia are all shoved in your face. I could care less if it's historically accurate or not...whatever it is, it's revolting! This theatre was packed when I went. During the movie many people walked out...in disgust I'm assuming. I had to leave after the two hour mark. There was a bad taste in my movie (from the movie!), my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. That should tell you something.The only saving grace in this is that they got some respected actors who, despite the material, give good performances The late John Gielgud is in the first 10 minutes and then killed off (a wise choice), Peter O'Toole is killed off after 40 minutes (another wise choice). Poor Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren (who admits she did it just for the money) suffer through the entire film. They give two great performances...much better than the film deserves.A total piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs!"
"Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away. And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas."
"'The original and probably the best of the series dealing with the anti-Christ child who reeks havoc on the lives of his parents, presidential aspirant and ambassador, Gregory Peck and his lovely, but troubled wife-Lee Remick.As the child gets older, the woes of his parents worsen and why not. He was destined to destroy them to move closer to his ultimate goal of world control.As the sinister governess, Billie Whitelaw is excellent is conveying the emotion of an evil woman.The ending is quite predictable. Nobody allows a child to get stabbed to death under Hollywood standards.While adequate for the part, Peck seems uncomfortable when not acting in films of social consciousness. This film is more like social horror.'"
"At the time of its release, PRETTY BABY attracted a lot of controversy for its subject matter and matter-of-fact nudity of pre-teen Brook Shields (Violet).Now it would probably not get made at all -- which is a shame, because it's a solidly written and directed drama.The late Louis Malle, who also directed the amazing BLACK MOON, approaches the subject of child prostitution without judgement or moralizing.\nThe film's effectiveness comes from a script that does not burden any of its characters with explanatory dialog. Most of the dialog heard is of the incidental kind. Characters do not pause to explain situations or pontificate. Malle captures glances, body language, reflections and uses the non-verbal to tell his very human story of a New Orleans cathouse.Susan Sarandon, as Violet's prostitute mother, turns in a fine performance as a woman in denial of her reality. Keith Carradine, who plays a photographer who falls in love with Violet, delivers a perfectly tuned performance with little more than than a dozen lines of dialogue. Also worth nothing is the beautiful performance of Francis Faye as Nell, the cathouse madam. She brings a sharp gift for irony to her role.Brooke is very, very good, too, and this was the performance of her career."
"'Wholesome woman leaves Austrian convent and goes to be governess for a captain\'s children right before the Nazis take over Austria. Go figure! As it was, I spent most of The Sound of Music throwing out the sort of comments that Mike, Servo and Crow hurl at the grade-Z movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie The Sound of Mucus - I thought to myself: So that\'s the guy from \'The Return of the Pink Panther\', \'Dragnet\', \'Dolores Claiborne\', \'The Insider\' and \'Syriana\'? As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her Mary Poppins role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.For the record, one of the Simpsons comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry? Anyway, TSOM isn\'t terrible; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century. I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise (RIP) for West Side Story.'"
"I was slightly disappointed considering Dario Argento's reputation. It is said SUSPIRIA may be the best Italian horror flick. The story line is not really clear at times and definitely not obvious. Special effects are pretty gory and the music is really good and sets a scary atmosphere. The opening sequence is a bit mysterious, but makes sense when the finale plays out. To be exact, the final fifteen minutes or so are the best of the whole movie. The sets resemble nothing I've seen before. Shadows usually nurture fear.An American dancer enters a renowned European ballet academy to waltz into an eerie situation. A secret door is opened and leads to the discovery that the staff is a wicked coven with intentions of gaining converts. It is sensed the newcomer must be eliminated and become part of the ever growing body count. Starring are: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Alida Valli, Flavio Bucci, Udo Kier and veteran actress Joan Bennett."
"'The gruesome granddaddy of all films living dead, the original Night of the Living Dead still devours its successors. With this one, George A. Romero produced the horror equivalent of Citizen Kane. His black and white photography, and direction, is outstanding. And, Mr. Romero\'s excesses are in check; every indulgence seen on screen gratifyingly fits the mood of the film. Karl Hardman, John Russo, and Russ Streiner are certainly most valuable players. The non-acting approach of heroic Duane Jones (as Ben) and the cast is effective, and refreshing. Influential and inspirational, the film\'s anti-Hollywood and/or low budget flaws have been rendered irrelevant.

"'What has all the fuss been about with this movie? Can somebody tell me? This was not scary. It was just stupid, with no-name fair actors, at best. The dialog is laughable; the special-effects are too dated to be taken seriously in 2008 (actually, by the 1980s, too). Some films get get reputations early on and all the national critics follow like sheep, giving you the same unwarranted hype about how great a film is, and this Night Of The Living Dead is a perfect example of that. A horror movie is supposed to raise a few hairs on the back of your neck, not put you to sleep. These zombies look like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin - maybe that\'s why it\'s gotten rave reviews.Trust me, this is a total waste of time.'"

"'Superman is not exactly a pinnacle in film history, but is a great film never-the-less. There is so much to like about this film it boggles the mind. First off, Marlon Brando playing Jor-el in the way only Brando could. Second, you got Gene Hackman as one of the major bad-asses of comic-book adaptations. Even parents (who might be reluctant to watch anything with their kids) will want to take a look-see at Brando, Hackman, and Christopher Reeve as the man of steel which many baby boomers remember to be their child hood hero. In fact, there are many who do consider this the best super-hero film ever made. Its way up there for me, as it is a well done, with some great action and good actors. A+'"
"An airplane crew takes ill. Surely the only person capable of landing the plane is an ex-pilot afraid to fly (Robert Hays). But don't call him Shirley.With a cast that includes Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack and many others, how can you go wrong? You simply cannot. And of course by now everyone knows this is a winner -- if you have not seen it yet (you have had over thirty years, folks) you need to make this a priority.Although I am generally a fan of the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks, there is plenty of wit in this. For every crude sexual joke, there are just as many clever puns and plays on words. A real range of humor styles that appeals to a broad audience."
"My 15-year-old friends bought this DVD, so we watched it together. Totally sophomoric humor, I enjoyed some of it but overall it is just too stoopid to be funny as a movie. I thought Kareem Abdul Jabbar (formerly Lew Alcindor) as co-pilot was one of the better actors here. The scene, played up big in trailers, where the nose of the large airplane goes through the window, into the terminal. That isn't an airplane at all. It's actually a full-scale mock-up of Jimmy Durante's nose.  Its best rating is somewhere in the 3 to 5 range.SPOILERS follow -- in a cross-country flight passengers choose between meat and fish for dinner. Turns out the fish meals were tainted, everyone who ate them get deathly ill, including the pilot and co-. A former avaitor who became scared during a battle is a passenger, he is pressed into service to try and land the plane. Instantly forgettable movie."
"A sniper (Andrew Robinson) is hunting the city of San Francisco. He calls himself Scorpio demanding a $100k ransom. The Mayor (John Vernon) plays along agreeing to pay despite Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood)'s objections. While having lunch, he witnesses a bank robbery and takes down the crooks. He has the nickname Dirty Harry because he hates everybody. Chico Gonzalez is his new partner with his old one still in the hospital.The investigation meanders a bit early on. He goes off in different directions. He even gets to go talk down a jumper. First he berates him and then he knocks him out. Non of it matters because Dirty Harry is such a compelling new character. He's a movie icon for the ages. He's the gruff inappropriate police detective and a terrific role for Clint Eastwood."
"'Police officer Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is on the trail of a vicious killer who snipes his victims from high rooftops, and holds the city hostage. If he is not paid, the killings will continue. How do you stop a man with such a motive? This is probably Eastwood\'s best-known role. Sure, he is also the man with no name for Sergio Leone, but can you picture him any more clearly than with magnum, asking if you\'re lucky? This is also a great role for John Vernon who plays The Mayor. Perhaps better known as the dean in Animal House he really came through strong.I have to give the film credit for making this, so soon after the Zodiac Killer... I\'m sure the fear was still fresh for many in California. Scorpio is somewhat less scary than Zodiac, but his methods are so unpredictable, anyone\'s a target if they go outside.The Internet Movie Database also recommends the Bird With the Crystal Plumage if you like this film. I do not see the connection, but love that film, so I\'ll go ahead and recommend it here, too.'"
'I like the bit where he asked the punk if he felt lucky'
"'A wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder.This plot is simple yet extraordinarily complex in its own way and incredibly effective. What comes out of it is one of the most influential films of all time, and arguably Hitchcock\'s best (though others, including Rope, could claim that honor).James Stewart is an impressive lead, and this is likely the finest role for Grace Kelly in her relatively short Hollywood career (before getting swept off to Monaco). Raymond Burr? Very subtle, as he is among the bigger stars here in a surprisingly small part.'"
"While many movies around that time, made sci-fi movies with evil aliens that tried to invade the earth (Danger from above stuff), this movie dared to be more philosophical. And it succeeds in doing so. The message is there, the acting is good (not only for a sci-fi movie) and it doesn't hammer the message into your head. It's stoic and it's slow moving, it doesn't have frenetic action, but it stays with you, even though it's not flawless.The movie is really good and it really wasn't necessary to make a Remake ... but the went ahead and made one in 2008. While they said they'd make an update on the whole thing, the Original is still the one to look out for!"
"Much-celebrated, well-acted drama has Bette Davis in now-famous role as Margo Channing, Broadway actress with a heart-of-gold who takes in devoted fan Anne Baxter, unaware the neophyte has designs on her life. Boozy and bitchy, and written with a cleverly poisonous pen, but not especially interesting once all the pieces have fallen into place (with at least thirty minutes left on the clock). These pompous, dryly decadent people do a lot of emoting and sounding-off, but we don't learn much about what's going on under the surface. Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz doesn't so much see this story as a chess-board as he does a gossipy cocktail party. Despite the film's multiple Oscars, it can leave one with a chilly, hollowed-out impression. **1/2 from ****"

"This is a beloved film by many, but I'm afraid it's not my thing.That is not to say that I couldn't admire the quality of the writing and the performances being given, but cinema is subjective, and I didn't enjoy this film."
"'Nineteen seventy-eight saw the release of the first two movies that dealt seriously with the Vietnam War: Coming Home and The Deer Hunter. The latter portrays some Russian-American friends working in a factory and going hunting before shipping off to Vietnam.I guess that this movie\'s biggest problem is its approach to the war in general. Whereas Apocalypse Now directly condemned the US occupation of Vietnam, this one mainly focuses on the Americans getting killed there. Also, when it came out, there were complaints about how it portrayed the North Vietnamese: cruelly taking the Americans prisoner and making them play Russian Roulette.As long as one understands the approach that this movie is taking, then it\'s good. One really interesting aspect is the contrast between the children and their immigrant parents: while the parents remain very religious - and the men drunk - the children are getting very much into popular culture and such things. Overall, a good movie as long as you understand it, although I would have given Coming Home Best Picture. Great performances from Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale, George Dzundza, and John Savage.'"
"'Important, Vibrant, and Clunky...Loud, Choppy and Amateurish...Ambitious, Influential, and Insufferable. The First Part of the Mad Max Trilogy was a Huge International Hit but Viewing it Today seems Tame, Albeit Adventurous. It Reeks of Film Student Excesses with a Similar Lack of Restraint. The Sound Levels Waver Inconsistently and Much of the Dialog and other Sounds are Mixed so Badly that it Reminds at Times of Early Porno.But it has Guts and Glory. Not Edited very well or Wholly Coherent, the Total Package does Deliver a Limited Rewarding Experience. It is Roughly Made but it sets the Standard for Itself so High that it Only Occasionally Reaches its Lofty Goals.A Drive-In, Grindhouse Perennial the Movie made Mel Gibson a Star and Started a Post Apocalyptic, Dystopian B-Movie Trend. The Sequel, The Road Warrior or Mad Max 2 (1981) is Probably the Movie Director George Miller wanted to make in the First Place and is a much more Accomplished, Professional Film All Around.Heavily Flawed but Nevertheless Made its Mark and is Considered a Cult Classic.'"
"Way over produced and exaggerated, this overrated Movie has a number or funny bits and some bouncy Music, some of it by real Soul and R&B greats, but it is also filled with so many car crashes that it wrecks the momentum. There could easily be 45 minutes cut in the form of unnecessary big budget, obligatory scenes and this would be a more enjoyable Musical/Comedy. As it is, there is so much that is disjointed and destructive that it literally collapses onto itself with over indulgence and unrestrained tomfoolery.Worth a view for the better parts, but be prepared to endure endless repetition, mostly of the vehicular nature. Aykroyd and Belushi were naturals on SNL and other projects, but this big production didn't do them any favors in the creative department because they were buried in so much rubble."
"'A village has been hounded by bandits who come in to steal their rice and barley. Sick of it, they decide to hire a samurai to protect them before the next raid. Soon, the number grows to seven... and the bandits have a heck of fight on their hands.Akira Kurosawa is a master, both in writing and directing. Some have compared this film to Orson Welles\' Citizen Kane for its greatness. And surely, we have seen many, many directors and films who have expressed their admiration -- sometimes in words, sometimes by imitation.The film has been said to be the first where an assembled group of men go on a mission. That may well be true. I find it even more impressive that Kurosawa was able to make such a production so relatively soon after World War II, when Japan should have been struggling with recovery. Indeed, the filming quality is not up to American standards for 1954, but he more than makes due with what he has.I really need to see the film again to get a fair assessment of it, but I enjoyed it greatly and think it needs more exposure.'"
"'This film is about several actors filming for a failing Hollywood war production in the middle of a real war zone.I did not find this film as funny as people claim. Many jokes fall flat. Jack Black makes exaggerated shouts and moves all the time, which is annoying rather than funny. The Simple Jack joke was not funny, it\'s just plain silly. I find it hard to believe that Simply Jack happens to be the only film the Vietnamese drug lords have seen. Isn\'t that too much of a coincidence? Having a child to lead a drug gang is in fact sad. References to Jennifer Love Hewitt and Lance make bring a small giggle, but that\'s it. I think this film had so much promise with the interesting idea and a stellar cast. But unfortunately it did not work for me.'"

"'CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is the most shocking movie in its sub-genre, mostly due to its realistic depiction of mutilation, disembowelment, rape, etc. In addition to this grisly, disturbing fare, there is also unflinchingly REAL animal cruelty of the first order. Animal lovers are wise to avoid watching these graphic, arguably unnecessary scenes.As for the movie itself, it concerns the recovered films from a lost crew of documentarians who ventured into the Amazonian rain forest, never to return. Once viewed, their films make it clear that what happened was an example of vile depravity at its most extreme level. It\'s also obvious that the lost filmmakers went missing for good reason.This movie leaves a mark, asking the question: Who are the true savages?.CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST was ahead of its time in that it was principally a found footage film, years before the ballyhoo over THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. In HOLOCAUST, this footage is essential to the story.Director Ruggero Deodato certainly captured unbridled perversion and defilement like never before. Though there have since been movies that go beyond his effort, few are as visually arresting...'"
"Truly a terrible film is this 2005 colossal stinker. At first, while viewing the film, you think it's basically a trilogy of 3 stories in a horrible urban environment.Bruce Willis, as the cop with the heart condition, appears briefly and is resurrected much later in the film.You can never recognize Mickey Rourke from his battered, broken face on screen.The violence in the film is unbelievable. Women come off as predators of the worst degree.The plot is extremely thin and basically non-existent.Certainly, more should have been spoken about with regard to the corrupt senator."
"I resisted seeing this when I was in high school. You know. All that singing and dancing (and nobody slaughtered). I also noticed some of the girls were reading those books and I wasn't about to be seen at the theater. Time passed and one night it was on TV (many years ago) and I found the artistry, the storytelling, and every aspect of this to be mesmerizing (I even liked the kids and I usually can't stand kid actors). Of course, it's Julie Andrews grabbing hold of the role and taking it to the house. She is cute and caustic and fun. But the person who shows what a huge talent he is is Dick Van Dyke. It came to my attention that the guy never had any dancing lessons. There are two showstoppers at least where my jaw dropped. The Disney animators were able to put him into scenes (way ahead of the advent of CGI) and allow him the freedom to do the most marvelous things. This is a very long movie for a musical comedy. But it doesn't matter. There is love and sadness and all kinds of emotions portrayed here. Feed the birds!"
"'As the number of us who actually remember the types of gangs portrayed in this movie dwindle, it\'s easy to dismiss it as outdated--even humorous. What one needs to do, however, is consider it on its own merits--some of the most sophisticated music ever written for a musical (Leonard Bernstein). The choreography, gang posturing in your face rhythms, the dancing is breathtaking. Again, nothing is as dated as slang, but, as with Shakespeare, it was the language of the time. Those of you who find it amusing, take a look at current slang 20 years from now. Performances are pretty good although I\'ll never understand how Richard Beymer was selected for such a major role (his filmography is pretty limited) especially since they dubbed in his singing. Natalie Wood works OK but it\'s hard to imagine her a Puerto Rican. The Latins generally outperform the Anglos, but they probably have more to be angry about as characters. There is great tension in the music. When I first got a record of this I listened to it so often I could recite every word of every song. It\'s a fine musical. And, of course, there\'s Officer Krupke!'"
"'Early Wes Craven effort shows off the young filmmaker\'s burgeoning interest in everyday horrors. Craven, working on an extremely limited budget, creates a familiar scenario with ordinary people and then throws sadism, humiliation and murder into the mix (he did this again a few years later with The Hills Have Eyes). A drive-in variation on Ingmar Bergman\'s The Virgin Spring, the film concerns two free-spirited young girls out to score some drugs but instead being abducted by escaped convicts. Craven has the germ of an interesting concept--allegedly based on a true incident--and he manages to mount the dread and terror effectively enough, but the movie is garbled and sludgy, not to mention depressing, with vapid, disgusting villains. Still, it\'s watchable until the revenge-laden second-half, which is so poorly written and executed it mitigates any real interest in the outcome. An almost-immediate cult success, Last House spawned many imitations (House by the Lake, I Spit on Your Grave, Mother\'s Day), but the movie lacks even the smallest semblance of class. * from ****'"
"Teenage boy Mike (a credible and likeable performance by Michael Baldwin) suspects that the weird tall man mortician (a splendidly sinister turn by Angus Scrimm) at a mysterious funeral home is up to no good, but can't convince his older brother Jody (an engaging portrayal by Bill Thornbury) that something is amiss.Writer/director Don Coscarelli not only does a masterful job of creating and sustaining a supremely surreal'n'spooky gloom-doom atmosphere, but also cleverly blends elements of horror (the infamous silver sphere in particular is a startling sight to behold in action!), humor, and science fiction into an extremely unique, surprising, and hugely enjoyable whole. Moreover, Coscarelli also offers a rich exploration of basic adolescent fears and hang-ups pertaining to death, loss, sex, and fear of abandonment that gives this film a substantial amount of additional depth and resonance.Most importantly, the protagonists register well as sympathetic everyday folks who find themselves caught up in an otherworldly situation that's way beyond their ability to initially understand or effectively cope with. Reggie Banister lends sturdy support as easygoing ice cream man Reggie while Kathy Lester makes a favorable impression as the lovely (and lethal) Lady in Lavender. The spot-on creepy score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave further enhances the overall eerie mood. Totally deserving of its stellar cult classic status."
"'Here\'s another cult favorite that I was really, really anxious to view after reading a bunch of favorable comments about in review books. What a disappointment! Of the positive things I had read, eerily filmed and fascinating appealed to me most. I found neither. Did I expect too much?How a film this slow moving could be a cult favorite with today\'s audiences is beyond me. I don\'t believe it\'s true. I did appreciate some of the photography but the story dragged in so many spots that it took any enjoyment away from any good visuals. One of the reasons the secular-dominated critics might have liked this was that the main character went to work as a church organist, but was not a Believer. I\'m sure that part resonated with them. Otherwise, what\'s to like in this film? I\'m sorry, but this is way overrated.'"
"Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) is a drama critic and author of anti-marriage books. He marries neighbor Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane).

It turns out he is a crazy serial killer as well.It's a wacky broad black comedy. The comedy works best with Cary Grant. Priscilla Lane isn't quite up to his level. The aunts are kind of fun.

"That's entertainment.That, and one of the most influential films for me in my life, in films and just in general. Only a handful of pics have the same emotional and visceral impact seeing it at 26 the way it did when I was 12. In fact it's even deeper now some of it; when Jake confronts Joey in 1958 in the parking garage, this time seeing it, after seeing the scene countless times, it got to me and a few Jack-tears welled up. But not crying, whaddaya want, ya basterds.I could go on about how it's got the greatest boxing scenes in any movie. I could go on about Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are the B's-and-E's of movie acting at the time. I could go on how Scorsese's influence of the Clash made the movie that much better, if only subliminally. But hey, why go on. You should just see it. Preferably on a big screen where every PUNCH and EDIT get to you in Scorsese and Schoonmaker's kinetic, pile-driving cinema."
"It can be debated that this is the best boxing movie of all time. Never the less, Martin Scorsese delivers a masterful story based on Jake LaMotta's book. We get to see the rough, raw and rowdy story of LaMotta's(Robert De Niro)rise to the middleweight championship and his self-destructive exit from the glory and limelight. Great boxing scenes and unabashed emotional acting make this movie the masterpiece it is. De Niro is at the top of his game and probably plays one of his most memorable characters. Cathy Moriarty plays Jake's wife and kudos to Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother. Notable support from Nicholas Colasanto and Theresa Sadana. This sad, but triumphant film should not be missed. You get the punch for your bucks with this one."
"Right at the start of the movie, there is a disclaimer. What we see is not something that would ever happen. It says a lot about the state of mind people were in back then. Though if you consider how fast peope are in believing stuff on social media right now, you wouldn't have guessed that we evolved ... I reckon we haven't.But it also says a lot about the movie and how it can be perceived and what attention to detail this has. Certain things and mechanisms really seem to be taken from what actually happens or coild happen behind the scenes. Bureaucracy at its best ... or worst I reckon. But with amazing actors to boost! And a triple does of Peter Sellers. There may not be any fighting in the war room, but there is also no love lost there.Funny, intelligent but also over the top, while simultaneously also feeling like it could be real. It's the end of the world as we know it ... at least on film and not reality of course ..."
"'2012 is a science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich. It stars John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson, among others.Disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012. When a global cataclysm thrusts the world into chaos, divorced writer and father Jackson Curtis (Cusack) joins the race to ensure that humankind is not completely wiped out.He attempts to bring his children, Noah and Lilly , ex-wife Kate Curtis and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman to refuge and attempt to escape the heightened change in the elements. The movie provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.It is basically a total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-plus hours.'"
"An impeccably-made slice of Cold War satire, Kubrick's well-remembered black comedy is a sharp and snappy affair with the kind of production values and direction to dream for. An absurdist situation gives the famed director a chance to explore all kinds of character comedy, with the knives kept sharpest for the American military. The performers on show don't put a foot wrong, although of course the real merit goes to Peter Sellers who convinces in no less than three widely different performances. There are some wonderful lines and situations on show here that you'll remember for the rest of your life."
"'I\'m probably not the best judge of films like this because I just don\'t care about zombie flicks. There\'s something iconic about the original Night of the Living Dead that couldn\'t be duplicated in this sequel; part of it could be the use of iconic black and white in filming NOTLD, part of it could simply be the attempt at exploiting a formula that worked in the past. There was hardly even a story here, as it was all about four people trapped in a shopping mall knocking off the undead, and doing a poor job of it in many cases. I couldn\'t count the number of times I would have used a handgun or a rifle to dispatch a zombie only a few feet away that the principal characters allowed to walk on by. And not too quickly either I might add. Gosh but these zombies were slow. In the future, I think I\'ll take my zombie cinema in the way of pictures like Shaun of the Dead, that is, with a great big heaping of satirical fun. Not to mention deadpan humor, although I just did.'"
"'In her engagement party, the indecisive nineteen year-old Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is proposed in a gazebo in front of the guests by the snobbish and arrogant nobleman Hamish (Leo Bill). Before giving the answer, Alice sees a strange rabbit and escapes, falling down through a hole in a magic world called Underland. After drinking and eating magic potions to reduce her height, Alice meets animals that can talk and the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Alice helps the good White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to defeat her evil and tyrannic sister Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and returns a more confident teenager. Alice in Wonderland is a visually astonishing movie with a deceptive story. The lead character is confused and indecisive and her change in the end is at least weird. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Alice no PaÃ\xads das Maravilhas (Alice in the Wonderland)'"
"'Deliverance is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey, turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman. It\'s about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who\'re spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. Up there, they\'re faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I\'ve ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you\'ll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important movie as well. John Boorman\'s best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies. Just think about the terrific Duelling banjos musical score and, of course, the unforgettable homosexual squeal like a pig rape scene. All the actors deliver (haha) perfect acting performances. Especially Jon Voight. A must see motion picture!!'"
"No scratch that. Chinatown is actually my personal favourite of Roman Polanski's movies. It is a wonderful movie, as well as an affectionate and inspired homage to film noir, with a lot to love about it.Roman Polanski's direction is superb. He always directs with such precision in this movie and it shows loud and clear.The production values are terrific. Chinatown does look ravishing, the costumes, detail, scenery and cinematography are all exemplary.I am a big Jerry Goldsmith fan, since seeing The Wind and the Lion and hearing his amazing score for that. His music score up here is up there with his best, it doesn't feel hackneyed or generic in any way, it really shows a master at work.The script is brilliantly organised. In fact along with Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve I think Chinatown has one of the best screenplays ever written.The story is never less than compelling. It is a wonderful story thet has just the right amount of intensity without being too convoluted and paced really well.The acting I also can't fault. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances and he is terrifically supported by a ravishingly beautiful Faye Dunnaway and a truly terrific John Huston.Overall, a wonderful movie and one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Spoilers herein.Polanski is worth watching no matter what he does. Sometimes, the film is relatively free of context, like the nearly perfect `Ninth Gate.' But watching those take work because you have to cocreate the world.Sometimes the film is set in the context of a genre where the metanarrative is about how it sets within the genre. `Rosemary's Baby' was great because it played with everything that came before, adding great portions of architectural evil and fey vulnerability.Noir revolutionized film. The detective was our representative in the story, unravelling the order of the world. Noir turned that on its head, directly referencing what came before. The noir detective was still our avatar but was swept up in the world he was trying to understand. Everything happens TO him, not around him.Now Polanski does a Welles and Nicholson does a Brando. Both are techniques of self-commentary at the same time as commenting on the genre. Both are both IN the films and OF film, but until `Chinatown' they had never been attempted at the same time. This film changed the world. Huston was along for the ride.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"'I was a senior in high school in 1962 when Kubrick\'s Lolita was in theaters. I did not see it back then. Now, having lived for an additional 4 decades, I can appreciate it more anyway. The genius in Kubrick\'s direction is to let us, the audience, see clearly what is going on, while the players cannot. Sue Lyon played the coy Lolita so well, but when you read her biography and see that she had a series of short, failed marriages after this film was made, you have to wonder if her performance was so good because she was playing a character not far from herself. But the real star is Peter Sellers, playing Clare Quilty. Overall a fine movie depicting how unreasonable and blind obsession can cloud the thinking of otherwise reasonable and educated people. Here it was a man, but we certainly have not cornered that fault.After viewing this movie, I read Nabakov\'s book. It is much more revealing (no surprise there) as to how Humbert made an elaborate justification in his mind that is was OK for a man in his late 30s to have a sexual relationship with a girl in the 10 to 14 year old range, finally having one with Lo when she was 12. It of course is much more explicit in describing their passion and activities. Now I too am a bit surprised that the book was ever made into a movie.'"
"'a good adaptation. and, more important, the most seductive. because the mystery is the basic spice. not faithful to the novel but seductive demonstration of the talent of Kubrick to explore a sensitive theme. Peter Sellers is the master and James Mason does his the best as Humbert in a film who explores in great manner the sensuality and ambiguity of a relation who is presented by inspired allusions. short, one of films who must see. for atmosphere. for performances. for music. and for the force of the first scene. because it is not only a film by Kubrik. it represents a key to his universe, and, in same measure, for the period.'"
"'Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes! and This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!! are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor\'s trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!'"
"George Taylor (Charlton Heston), John Landon, Stewart and Dodge are astronauts on a near light speed spacecraft. After around 18 months in hibernation, they crash land on an unfamiliar planet. The year outside is 3978 AD around 2000 years after launch. Stewart is dead. The three survivors escape the sinking craft with almost no supplies. Primitive humanoids with no language steal their supplies and clothing. They are also raiding a corn field. Then they are set upon by a hunting party of apes.The apes don't show up until 35 minutes. When they do show up on horseback, it becomes movie history. The story is compelling to the bitter end. Charlton Heston has his John Wayne swagger. He is the big American iconic superior man. Sci-fi had an interesting run in the 60s and this is definitely part of it. Then there is the ape makeup. That's the biggest danger of this movie. It could have gone terribly wrong. However for its time, the makeup is done very well. The mouth moves a little. The main ape characters can show some emotions. This is a well made sci-fi icon."
"'This is an average film masquerading as great. I\'m not blaming Blake Edwards or the stars--after all, they were just making a picture. Instead, this movie is the ultimate personality cult picture. In other words, people are SO OVERWHELMED with Audrey Hepburn, they glomp onto a picture and act like it is one of the best pictures ever made. For movie poster collectors, they saw the value of posters from this little movie skyrocket to astronomical heights (it is currently one of the most valuable posters from the 1960s) due to the rise of this cult.The sad thing is that this isn\'t one of Ms. Hepburn\'s best pictures. Better films such as A Nun\'s Story, Love in the Afternoon or Sabrina are superior when compared side by side. My assumption is that those who fuel this cult probably never saw the movie or never saw her other films.By the way, even if I am way off in my attitude towards this film (since so many love it), you\'ve gotta admit that the movie deserves to lost a point or two because of the insane casting of Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi--a Japanese man!!! Not only was this stupid, but highly offensive and insensitive.'"
"'Jaws was one of the most frightening pieces of cinema ever created. It is a combination of sight, sound, and terror. It has some truly epic scenes and some absolutely memorable lines. So the producers have the gall to create a sequel that is about as bad as a movie can be. Everything that was startling and exciting in the original is lost here. There are people getting themselves into ridiculous situations because of their base stupidity. We have a helicopter attacked by a shark. If I had my way, a real great white shark should have shown up, eaten the cast, munched on the director and producer, and ended the movie with a huge burp. No script. No believable plot. No nothing.'"
"As good an actor as he is, ROY SCHEIDER cannot reprise his role in the first JAWS and be half as effective if the script and director are not up to the challenge of producing a first rate sequel. Putting Scheider through the same paces again in Amityville, with the John Williams music looming over the soundtrack whenever appropriate, is not enough. There are no new elements to the story of shark attacks--and, in fact, it all seems just as mechanical as the shark itself that is shown once too often.Some of the shark scenes are effective, particularly the opening scene with the divers and the one with the girl on water skis, but the moment the film hits dry land the story hits rock bottom and drags on and on until the next incident. The presence of a few familiar faces doesn't really help. Missing are Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and the gripping story that made the first movie so terrific. As a replacement, we have some annoying teen-agers who've been warned not to go sailing just yet, one of whom is Scheider's son.As sequels go, this is barely fair...but the fright factor is not strong enough this time to prevent you from going into the water again."
"When I critique a film, I usually begin with a synopsis. That is where my problems start with David Lynch's Eraserhead: what with not having a conventional narrative, it doesn't lend itself to being easily synopsised.So let me say that it appears to be about a strange man and matters and characters concerning his strange mutant offspring although any or all of it may be fantasy.I must say initially that I suspect that the movie is very close to showing on screen exactly what David Lynch intended: I can't imagine these images or events being accidental or unintentional.I must then go on to say that I don't like it very much. Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way, although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me. The images are unpleasant and unappealing. The main character doesn't invite me to identify with him. I don't understand what Lynch is trying to do, as a result of which I can't engage with the movie on any level except visual and, on that level, Lynch seems to have set out to ply me with a disturbing visual experience which I didn't enjoy.So I have to say that while I admire Lynch's ability to capture something which is, at best odd and, at worst, twisted, it wasn't really my thing."
"David Lynch's first movie. Surreal, pretentious, meaningless nonsense. Was interesting for a while, but then just degenerated into nonsensical, random imagery.Only thing I learned from this is that David Lynch didn't start making pretentious crap with Lost Highway - it started with his first movie."
"Unlikable misfit factory worker Henry Spencer (a nicely deadpan portrayal by Jack Nance) lives in hellish squalor in a shabby apartment with his glum girlfriend Mary X (the pretty, but shrill Charlotte Stewart) and their grotesque constantly mewling mutant baby.With its jarring sound design, bleak industrial landscape, hypnotically gradual pace, funky old school practical special effects, and potently brooding gloom-doom mood fraught with dread, decay, and despair, David Lynch's debut full-length feature possesses a surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's uniquely its own singularly warped thing. Better still, the grim dream-like world presented herein proves to be so vivid, aberrant, and strangely convincing that once seen it's impossible to forget about. The interesting array of colorfully quirky secondary characters rates as another substantial asset: Allen Joseph as cranky plumber Mr. X, Laurel Near as a sweet and cheerful swollen-cheeked gal who lives in Harry's radiator, Jack Fisk as the badly scarred man in the planet, Judith Ann Robets as a seductive and predatory neighbor, Neil Moran as Henry's stern boss, and Darwin Joston as browbeaten desk clerk Paul. The striking black and white cinematography by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell offers a wondrous wealth of startling and bizarre visuals. A fascinating one-of-a-kind oddity."
"'A common theme in Alfred Hitchcock\'s movies was chaos: collapsing innocence in Shadow of a Doubt, getting drug into a murder plot in Strangers on a Train, the possible murder in Rear Window, the shower scene in Psycho, or the avians\' unexplained killing spree in The Birds. But more specific than simply chaos, is getting falsely accused of something, as happens in North by Northwest. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an executive who gets mistaken for someone else. When he tries to avoid involvement, they set him up by murdering someone at the United Nations. Now he\'s on the run, and can trust only Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).Almost as famous as the crop-duster scene is the Mt. Rushmore scene. The way that one might interpret that scene is not what happens there, but what the monument itself represents. It shows past presidents, as if to represent the highest authority, as the UN scene might have been doing.Another interesting scene is the auction. If you look at how Eve is dressed and how she is seated, you notice that she is sort of like the colorful halfway point between two drab points, represented by two men (maybe that\'s just my interpretation). And of course Eva Marie Saint was one of Hitchcock\'s icy blondes, much like Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren.Once again, Hitch proved himself to be a master director.'"
"Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away.This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one.The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything."
"If there is one thing I've learned in life that is: if it sounds to good to be true then it usually is. A big beautiful house in the country for an amazingly low price... what's the catch? Oh, it's just haunted that's all. I'd have to put Amityville Horror amongst the top scary movies. I know that I am far from an authority on scary movies (they are usually 3rd or 4th on my list of genre when renting a movie) but I have seen enough horror films to know a good one, and Amityville Horror was good. Even better is that although the movie was made in 1979, I didn't even see it until 2006 and I still liked it. I usually judge scary movies by how much it can startle me or frighten me without excessive blood and gore. Amityville Horror really gave me the feeling that the house had an ominous presence. George Brolin did an excellent job in his role, and I liked that it was never revealed what exactly was in the house."
"George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced.Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that."
"'British Colonel, and shameless exhibitionist, T.E. Lawrence, stationed in Cairo during the first World War, is sent by the military into the Arabian desert to locate a reclusive prince; living amongst the soldiers and bandits, he uses his flair for adventure to his advantage, leading an army in the war between the Arabs and the Turks. Sprawling, of course, but also imposing epic drama from director David Lean, with a nearly four-hour length that can be self-defeating. It\'s a film that should be seen on the big screen to get the full effect, although Lean\'s staggering grandeur tends to dwarf the plot, which is hardly a study of T.E. Lawrence and more a commercially-viable action picture. The performances are solid and intense, and there are many memorable sequences, but it\'s far more exhausting than moving. Visually it\'s always exciting, but we don\'t sense the broiling hot sun, or the winds whispering over the dunes. It\'s too much a tableaux. For a director like Lean to slaver over a project for so many years, Lawrence of Arabia should be a passionate document. But it doesn\'t ache, it doesn\'t bleed--it\'s a stunningly shaped rock, an unmovable one. **1/2 from ****'"
"'ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is a wonderful example of what can be achieved with a talented director on a very low budget. My only criticisms are  the plothole of having the gangs hiding so they aren`t discovered by police patrol cars ( I thought that`s what the gangs would have wanted - a toe to toe war with  the pigs  ) , the ending which is something of an anti-climax but knowing the budget this is understandable . John Carpenters best film and his best score Dum dum dum du du dum , dum dah dah du du dum'"
"In 1930 Long Island, the Armstrong girl Daisy is kidnapped. During the media circus, the family pays the ransom but the girl is found dead. Five years later in Istanbul, various people board the Orient Express. Famed detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) encounters his friend Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the line. Other passengers include American widow Mrs. Harriet Hubbard (Lauren Bacall); American businessman Samuel Ratchett (Richard Widmark), his translator Hector McQueen (Anthony Perkins) and English manservant Beddoes (John Gielgud); Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller) and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachel Roberts); Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi (Michael York) and his wife Elena (Jacqueline Bisset); British Indian Army officer Col. John Arbuthnott (Sean Connery); teacher Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave); timid Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman); car salesman Antonio Foscarelli (Denis Quilley); and American theater agent Cyrus B. Hardman (Colin Blakely). Ratchett tries to hire Poirot claiming to be in danger. Later, he's found stabbed to death.This production is overflowing with acting masters. It can be overwhelming to keep track of the numerous characters and the various clues. It is a master class of acting and mannerisms. It is a little slow and old-fashion considering its over two hours running time. It is classic whodunit. Overall, it is impeccably made by director Sidney Lumet."
"Samuel Ratchett(Richard Windmark)asks Poirot(Albert Finney, having a field day as the sleuth)to be his bodyguard after receiving several death threats. He is later found dead and Poirot discovers quite a secret..Ratchett is indeed a notorious gangster Cassetti, the mastermind behind a kidnapping gone awry with the end result being the death of little girl Daisey Armstrong. Everyone on board is suspect as Poirot, with help by Signor Bianchi(the wonderful Martin Balsam)and Dr. Constantine(George Coulouris), will pursue the truth through a complex investigation that gets muddied when clues of a possible killer emerge as a concierge suit(a missing button from the suit is later found with a key to all the rooms hidden in the pocket)is found as well as the dagger. Through a collection of testimonials from each passenger on board, Poirot puts together his case.This film, as slickly directed by Lumet, does show the viewer little cues before and after the murder takes place who might've possibly done it. The opening set-up with the Armstrong family is a bit elusive, but after you watch the interrogations, Lumet allows you to understand what that opening montage of clips and such means. This cast is simply awesome, definitely the best I've seen assembled and that alone is novelty to re-watch this over and over. I consider it one of the all-time greatest entertainments. A good old fashioned mystery to escape into for two hours."
"'In 1930 a baby of the Armstrong family is kidnapped and held for ransom (this is obviously a reference to the Lindberg baby). The ransom is paid, but the baby is killed. Cut to 5 years later. Detective Hercule Poirot Albert Finney) is traveling to London on the Orient Express. An avalanche stops the train and a passenger (Richard Widmark) is found murdered. Who did it? Poirot has to question the all star cast to find out.This is a very big budget film. The sets and clothes are beautiful and the all star cast is having fun with their roles. Well-directed by Sidney Lumet too. Still this isn\'t that good. The movie is far too slow for its own good and I was getting bored by the end. The plot is (I thought) needlessly convoluted and Poirot\'s explanation at the end goes on forever. Also I thought the final revelation of who the killer was was more than a little unlikely.Still it is fun to watch an all star cast play suspects. The acting is pretty good--no one is bad. The standouts in the cast are Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Wendy Hiller and Ingrid Bergman (winning an Oscar). This led to Death on the Nile (which is much better) and Evil Under the Sun (good also but it bombed). So I give it a marginal recommendation for the cast alone.'"
"'As I sit here thinking about this movie, I am realizing that this is one of the few comedies I wouldn\'t mind if it were heavily edited first. In other words, if all the funny moments (i.e., all the stuff with Rodney Dangerfield) were shown and the rest of the film pitched in the trash, I DON\'T think that would be so bad. That\'s because despite it\'s achieving cult status, this isn\'t all that good a film--with sloppy direction, an annoying performance by Bill Murray (who is capable of so much better), a worthless story about some teenagers (and I HATE most teenager movies from the 70s and 80s) and a rather wooden performance by Chevy Chase. Hmmm,...now that I think about it, apart from Rodney Dangerfield and, perhaps the cute groundhog, there isn\'t a whole lot I loved about the film. A sub-par film saved by genuinely funny dialog between Dangerfield and Ted Knight.'"
"'a state more than a place. a space of truth. and its bitter price. the fascination of a trip in the traces of self define. words as stones. looks as veils to cover the reality. the girl. and the ash of desires, temptations, fears , memory, humanity limits and pride. at first sigh, only Tarkovski. as a king and magician and master . in fact, like each film made by this great director,Stalker is the film of the viewer. like a mirror. like a large cage. like a dialogue with himself. and this change everything. and this does the film more than a masterpiece. maybe a cathedral. or a tower. or a room in the lights and shadows of a presence escaping to any definition. because it is only a confession. about small things, about faith, about purposes, about hope. and the Christianity as echo.'"
"Director Philip Kaufman's remake/follow-up to the 1958 suspense classic is unnerving and unsettling...but also unsatisfying. Alien pods are replacing human beings with robot-like replicants, and Kaufman does a great job at setting the scene: following believably eccentric San Franciscans through the city as mysterious flowers begin popping up all over the place! Curly-headed Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are very companionable co-stars here, and Kaufman's energy-level starts high, but the film seems to get weighed down with its own minutiae. W.D. Richter's screenplay is hectic and muddled, and the picture scrambles around for an ending. Kaufman is vigilant that his version of this story will not conclude happily (as the studio-mandated original did); that's fine, but his conception, while at times admirable, is also dispiriting--and ugly instead of scary. **1/2 from ****"
"'This is an old classic available on nearly every old horror film multi-pack in various restored conditioned.A party is being held and 5 strangers are invited to spend the night with a reward of $10,000 in 1959 dollars. It is hosted by Vincent Price and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) is set up as the Final Girl except that formula didn\'t exist. Special effects include doors closing by themselves, still used today in found footage films. It also has a floating head effect using a black background, common in 50\'s films. The sound track would be considered over-the-top camp by today\'s standards, but how else can you make this stuff scary? The feature includes Elisha Cook Jr., who would later defend Capt. Kirk when he was accused of neglect in the death of Finney. He always creates a great character. TV star Richard Long had the classic slick Brylcreem hair of the era with a big part on the left side, a style I was forced to wear until adulthood...scarred for life. Worth the flashback.'"
"The movie is about a strange rich guy (Price) who pays five seemingly random people to come to a party in a haunted house where seven people were supposedly murdered. Each is told if they stay the night, they will receive $10,000 in the morning. However, soon after this, murders begin occurring and everyone is terrified for their lives. The film does have a somewhat interesting twist at the end, though otherwise it's a haunted house film. It does try very hard and William Castle threw practically everything into this film to make it entertaining--except a decent script. Sure, it's fun to watch, but also pretty brainless--with lots of dumb plot devices and holes. For example, the home that all the people are in has a vat of acid in the basement under a trap door! Huh?! And, later, someone trips into it! Pretty clumsy, huh?! As far as the acting goes, it's not especially inspiring. Price is amazingly restrained in his performance--and I really wished he'd acted with a little more energy. Most of the rest of the actors were okay, though Elisha Cook should have been a tad embarrassed for his over-acting--he really was quite silly.Overall, the film is mediocre and very skip-able unless you are a huge Price fan."
"'Despite getting up in years, foul-mouthed ice hockey coach Paul Newman (as Reggie Reg Dunlop) still plays with his young team. Unfortunately, the Charlestown Chiefs are big losers. Then, they start to play rough. Violent antics end their losing streak and Mr. Newman\'s brawling icemen are suddenly bruising for the championship. They\'re also filling the stands with blood-thirsty fans...With outrageous comedy, writer Nancy Dowd and director George Roy Hill capture the sport well; there is a lot of truth here, satirical and otherwise. Newman receives his main support (more or less) from closet exhibitionist Michael Ontkean (as Ned Braden) and their possibly gay manager Strother Martin (as Joe McGrath). As a boozing neglected wife, Lindsay Crouse (as Lily) is a stand out. Especially noteworthy are the hilarious Hansons (Jeff Carlson, Steve Carlson & David Hanson).******** Slap Shot (2/25/77) George Roy Hill ~ Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin, Lindsay Crouse'"
"'Like Bull Durham, the sport takes second fiddle to a bunch of intrigue. It\'s about aging players, greedy owners, manipulation, on and on. Paul Newman decides he has to take action to make sure his team manages to draw. In the small city where they play, there is a mill. The people who work at the mill are the fans. The mill is going to close, which will render the place a ghost town. This moves into an anything-for-a-laugh hockey movie with some totally unforgettable characters. When the Carlson brothers show up and goon hockey starts, we are amazed at the way the whole game becomes nearly surreal. Don\'t take this seriously.'"
"'I had to shake my head watching the outdoor NHL hockey game on New Years Day this year (2008) at Buffalo. In between periods, NBC announcer Bob Costas reminisced about his favorite sports movie. It was this one: Slap Shot. Although I did enjoy this movie 30 years ago, I can\'t say I echo Bob\'s sentiments today, but I laughed along with him when it came out in 1977.It seemed that films in the \'70s were either outrageously good or ridiculously sleazy regarding language, sex, or irreverence. Most tended toward the latter. Many movies - like this one - had tons of overdone profanity, As for sports movies, none was more profane than this one which, in essence, was a real takeoff on goon style of hockey. Kudos for that, and the NHL finally woke up 30 years later and cleaned up its sport.After not seeing this in over 20 years, I was shocked it looked and sounded so seedy with almost every sentence seemingly having a cuss word!. It sounded like slob-like Animal House mentality on ice skates. However, I do admit there were a lot of funny scenes and I\'ll always remember the Hanson brothers, along with Oggy Ogglethorp. If hearing the Lord\'s name in vain constantly doesn\'t offend you, you\'ll get a lot of laughs out of these characters, on and off the ice.'"
"'On their way to a vacation destination, the Carter family, led by the self-assured patriarch, Big Bob Carter (Russ Grieve) find themselves lost in a desert wasteland. Their truck / camper disabled, they do what they must to find help. Unbeknownst to the Carters, another family is nearby... watching and waiting for dark.THE HILLS HAVE EYES is Director Wes Craven\'s savage statement about modern life. The Carter\'s are soft, civilized, and oblivious to danger. Not even Big Bob\'s background in law enforcement, nor his big gun are of much use against the terror they face. Stripped of their safety and security, they will certainly die unless they can revert back to a more primitive state. When the killing starts, it\'s sudden and violent, including sexual assault.Harrowing and shocking for its time, Craven saves the most powerful parts for last, when the remnant of the Carters are brought into a full-on, vengeful rage. So much for civilization under extreme stress. This is a brilliant commentary on what we are capable of when dire circumstances dictate.Co-stars Dee Wallace, as well as Michael Berryman in the role of his career...'"
"'Usually, we think of Wes Craven\'s movies as really cool. The Hills Have Eyes would likely be the one that splits people. An absolutely disgusting story of an all-American family getting stranded in a desert inhabited by cannibals, the movie leaves nothing to the imagination. There may be points in the movie where you have to remind yourself that it\'s only a movie; some of the scenes they really could have done without.Still, if we accept this as a cheap \'70s exploitation flick, then it\'s not bad at all. But I must warn you, only watch it if you have a very strong stomach. And yes, that\'s Dee Wallace (aka ET\'s mom) as Lynne.'"
"'You know how everyone describes Steve McQueen as cool? Well, The Great Escape shows why. As Capt. Virgil The Cooler King Hilts, trying with several other POWs to escape from a Nazi camp, he tunnels his way to coolness. Of course, he isn\'t the only character. There\'s visually impaired Flight Lt. Colin The Forger Blythe (Donald Pleasance), action-ready Flight Lt. Bob Anthony The Scrounger Hendley (James Garner), flippant Flight Officer Louis The Manufacturer Sedgwick (James Coburn), Flight Lt. Danny The Tunnel King Velinski (Charles Bronson), and others. Obviously, the setting didn\'t look too realistic (one would expect a POW camp to be a little dirtier than the one here), but either way, this is a cool movie.'"
"The lives of a Texan family over the course of about 40 years. There are multiple story lines dealing with death, marriage, racism, alcoholism, etc etc all beautifully directed (try to see it on a big screen or letter-boxed) and well acted. Despite its 3 1/2 hour length, the film is never dull. Elizabeth Taylor is just great as the mother of the family; Rock Hudson is a little stiff, but has his moments; James Dean is perfect in what was to be his last role; Dennis Hopper is interesting as their son (he's so YOUNG!). This movie never seems to have gotten the recognition it deserved. Why not?Well worth seeing again and again and again..."
"'Greetings again from the darkness.  Just attended the Dallas screening of the new digital version from Texas Instruments new digital projection system.  The colors literally jump off the screen.  Specifically, the scene where Rock Hudson and Paul Fix are in the car and Liz Taylor rides by and stops to wave to dad, the black coat on her steed just shines like fresh paint.  This has always been a controversial film - too long, can\'t understand James Dean, too many racial elements, etc.  I love the film and appreciate it\'s many elements.  Real life for the 3 stars was remarkably unforgiving, but during this film we see each in their prime.  Liz was probably the most beautiful woman in the world, Rock Hudson at his most virile and James Dean acting playful and parodying his media image at the time.  So very sad that we were not able to see what this man could bring to film as he matured.  Fresh faced Dennis Hopper giving no indication of the decades of drug abuse that lie ahead.  Chill Wills provides the comic relief and most of the best one liners.  Mercedes McCambride exemplifying a woman\'s fear of not being needed.  Carroll Baker as the innocent, bright eyed youngster being used as a pawn and the pain associated when she realizes. So many great moments that the faults fade away.'"
"'Considered in Some Circles to be the First Slasher Movie.But this Type of Declaration is Fraught with Opinionated Opportunism.It is the One-Film that Created the Holiday Horror Movie.No Holiday is more Sacrosanct then Christmas and is why Bob Clark Changed the Original Title from Stranger in the House.The Movie is quite Accomplished Artistically Apart from the Usually Uninspired Creation from Low-Budget Band Wagon, Bottom-Line Imitators.The Atmosphere and Look of the Movie has a Colorful Quality and Takes Advantage of Holiday Trappings and Festivity.Alcohol Plays a Prominent Influence On-Screen and even has Margot Kidder (who insisted of drinking real alcohol during filming) Dispensing Drinks to a Minor.The Film also Includes Lewd and Profane Dialog.The Contemporaneous Real Life Serial Killings had Authorities and Other Overly Pius People Loudly Voicing Protests.Overall, the Movie does Deserve Accolades for Delivering its Low-Budget (around $600,000) Horror-Show with Style and Cutting-Edge Cinematic Ingredients that would be Imitated Ad-Nausea for Decades.With an Attention to Detail, for the Artistic Flourishes and its Trend-Setting the Movie is Essential for Horror Buffs. For Others its...Worth a Watch.'"
"Of course, for any moviebuff, any western movie buff, especially any feminist in the action film genre, the absence of Barbara Stanwyck can be noticed. It would have been the prefect film for her, any role here - McCambrige or Crawford's one - would have fit Stanwyck like a glove. If you think about MAVERICK QUEEN, FORTY GUNS, CATTLE QUEEN OF MONTANA or THE FURIES, you'll see what I mean. But those four latest westerns are in a bit lesser scale than this one, which is a pure masterpiece. Ben Cooper's physique reminds me Audie Murphy, but maybe not the character though."
"'A strong willed female saloon owner (Joan Crawford) is wrongly suspected of murder and bank robbery by a lynch mob, when she helps a wounded gang member.I can see why this western has something of a cult status. Certainly an outlaw who has a guitar strapped to his back rather than a gun makes for an interesting character. And it asks that age old question: can a leopard change his spots? Can Johnny Logan become Johnny Guitar? Joan Crawford leads the film, apparently because she helped produce it. For the life of me, I never figured out her appeal. Her acting is good but no great. She is no joy to look at. And from what I understand, she was more or less a terror to everyone around her. How did she ever get to be as big as she was?'"
"'For a movie which attempts to portray a mostly accurate portrayal it is curious to me they used his erroneous name of John, his real name was Joseph Carey Merrick. Still it is a very well made movie, in the 1880s England ordinary people did not know what to make of his deformities.I watched it at home, the 2-disc Criterion edition that I found at my local library. The second disc includes several interviews, including with John Hurt and director David Lynch.Good movie, should be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. Merrick died at age 27.'"
"Eyes Without A Face stars Pierre Brasseur as renowned French surgeon Docteur GÃ©nessier, who tries in vain to restore his daughter Christiane's beauty after a car-crash leaves her horribly disfigured. With the help of his devoted assistant Louise (Alida Valli), the doctor abducts young women, grafting their faces onto Christiane, with little success.Highly regarded by many horror connoisseurs, director Georges Franju's macabre mad-scientist classic benefits from a truly cruel villain in Docteur GÃ©nessier, who not only mutilates innocent girls, but isn't above tormenting one victim's father (by denying him the right to his daughter's body at the morgue), and treating Christiane like a guinea pig in his experiments. Eyes Without A Face also features some impressive early gore (albeit in black and white), with the surgical removal of a girl's face shown in unflinching detail, and grisly deaths for Louise and Docteur GÃ©nessier, who ultimately receive poetic justice.For me, though, the film is just a little too lethargic to be a wholly satisfying experience, the 'haunting' scenes with Christiane in her smooth rubber mask a tad repetitive and a little too much time spent where nothing much of interest occurs. Overall, it's a reasonably entertaining piece, but not as great as its reputation would have one believe."
"'Almost Mediocre Major Studio Movie that was not impressive in 1971 and fails to be of only moderate interest Today. It\'s Camp Value (meaning Cheesy) is what makes it work for some Folks, but for the most part its Glaring Ineptitudes cannot be forgiven, even for a Cheap Thrill.There are many things that stand out as Pedestrian and are Workmanlike and carry very little imagination. The Musical Score is ill fitting, chinsy, and intrude on many Scenes rather than underly or enhance. The Lepers (yes, there is some Clunky Christ Analogies) are Dressed Up like Monks and speak in some sort of Post Apocalyptic Religioso Jargon. He of the Wheel and so forth.Of Heston\'s Sci-Fi Trilogy of the Era, this is the worst by far. Watching Chuck watch Woodstock (1969) alone in a Movie Theatre mouthing the Dialog and uttering they don\'t make em\' like that anymore is not Eerie, just Irritating. Movie Audiences are to Lament the fact that they don\'t make any Movies anymore. Now that\'s something to feel sorry about after the World has Virtually been Wiped Out of People.But if they were only making Movies as Unremarkable and Flaccid as this one, that might not be a Bad Thing. That perfectly describes this one. A Bad Thing.'"
"This film is supposedly based on the true account of a prisoner who escaped from Devil's Island in French Guiana. However, the book by Henri Charriere about his experiences apparently has a LOT of inconsistencies and outright fabrications (a polite way of saying he was a liar). So, provided you understand that this isn't quite a true story, this is still an exceptional film. Much of this is due to incredible acting, direction, scripting and makeup.Henri Charriere, played by Steve McQueen, is going to Devil's Island for killing a pimp--supposedly in self-defense. On the boat, he meets a swindler played by Dustin Hoffman and they become friends.Most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came--either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement. All take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners, by Charriere is resilient. Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt. In the end, Charriere does escape, though in real-life, this apparently did NOT occur.While there is a lot more to the movie and what I have mentioned (after all it's a very long and involved film), the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison. So, be prepared for a movie that at times is very difficult to watch but is constructed it's an amazing film."
"'Henri Papillon (butterfly) Charierre (Steve McQueen) is a safecracker who claims to be innocent of murdering a pimp. He is sentenced to life and imprisoned in the notorious penal colony in French Guyana. On the voyage there, he offers his bodyguard services to forger Louis Degas (Dustin Hoffman) who sold fake government bonds. Degas has enemies like the prison guard who has family that lost money in the fake bonds. Papillon vows to escape. The colony conditions are horrific. He is put into solitary confinement but he continues to plan for his escape.This is possibly McQueen\'s best performance. Sure he\'s the cool guy but he gets to do a lot more. He gets to be weak in solitary and he gets to be old in the last act. Hoffman injects great comedic chemistry for the duo. There is great gallows humor early on. The crocodile scene is shocking and hilarious. There are great touching moments. And that cliff jump is insane. That\'s a thrill only a real stunt gives.'"
"'Hollywood ignored the fact that the cult classic musical was virtually unfilmable (not to mention the fact that by 1979 it was already outdated) and made it into a movie anyway. The results are predictably mixed. It\'s not a disaster, but it\'s no classic. It suffers from having a strong narrative forced on it, whereas the stage version felt organic and like it was being made up as the actors went along. The music sounds pretty good, but the whole movie has the taint of the unnecessary.Treat Williams is pretty good, and Nell Carter shows up in a cameo and knocks one out of the park with the White Boys/Black Boys number. Milos Forman (of all people) directed.Grade: B-'"
"'\'El Topo\' is still one of the strangest movies ever made but Alejandro Jodorowsky amazingly managed to top himself with \'The Holy Mountain\'. This movie contains some of the most weird and wonderful scenes in the history of movies. It is filled with bizarre images which draw upon many religions and occult philosophies, and seems to be inspired equally by Bunuel and the comic book sci-fi surrealism of William Burroughs.  It\'s a cliche but when I say you have to see it to believe it I\'m not lying! The movie is roughly in three sections. The first documents the trials and tribulations of The Thief, a Christ figure. The second introduces The Alchemist (played by Jodorowsky himself) and his seven disciples who are each represented by a planet. The third sees all these odd people (and a chimpanzee) go on a pilgrimage to The Holy Mountain. I found the third section to be much less interesting than the other two, and that, combined with the sensory overload of the earlier parts of the film, makes it not as successful as \'El Topo\' for me. But there\'s no denying that this is an extraordinary movie and anyone who appreciates strange and challenging films will find this to be the strangest and most challenging of all. Jodorowsky makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay! I can\'t truthfully say I get 90% of what he\'s getting at but boy, is it a trip trying to figure it out!'"
"Like David Lynch's Lost Highway, The Holy Mountain is a film I'd be liable to recommend to a species of intelligence superior to man. This film is almost unclassifiable by human standards, except to call it a surrealist film, which is what we label anything that intentionally doesn't make sense. The film has a few neat sequences here and there, including a cute ending (even though it is a rushed one). What bothers me most about The Holy Mountain is that frankly it is in very bad taste. Its content is irreverent, and vulgar, and whatever the film is trying to say doesn't come out very well.The middle section I think is the best part. A number of individual sequences experimenting with allegory and art direction bode much better than the film as an entire hundred minute story. Art critics will probably look at The Holy Mountain, and be reminded of Hieronymous Bosh's Garden of Earthly Delights. Among other things both feature copious amounts of over saturated, unnatural colors and frontal nudity. The Holy Mountain can be plushy while at the same time kind of gross. The end result is a mildly interesting art movie, sometimes nice to look at, and yet it's also kind of repulsive, and not very smart. Might be of interest to art fans."
"'HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER (1973) ***1/2 Clint Eastwood directed himself in this tip of the hat to mentor Sergio Leone as a variation on his violent Man With No Name, The Stranger, who unleashes vengeance on a small town in the Old West , takes it over painting it entirely red and renaming it HELL. Cool.'"
"The games people play. Throughout this entire film (based on an intense play by Edward Albee), we are never sure what the truth is. George and Martha have a marriage made in hell. They have an intense hatred of one another fueled by years of disappointment. Then again, perhaps this is how they express their love. Enter Sandy Dennis and George Segal who believe they are attending a quiet evening with an again professor and his wife. They are soon drawn into the clutches of these two. Elizabeth Taylor, with weight packed on to do the role, and Richard Burton, two cinema icons, strut their stuff, leading the poor souls who have wandered into the web with tales and sparks and deception. Dennis is a mousy little thing who tries to cope, but we can see her eroding each minute she is in this hornet's nest. This is one of America's great stage plays and the movie really does it justice. Was Taylor a great actress. You bet she was. And Burton. Oh yeah!"
"Breathless (1960).. also Ã bout de Souffle. Some very interesting filming techniques used (and avoided) during this production, according to the trivia section. Apparently based on an actual event that Truffaut had read about in the states. When a thief (Poiccard, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) tries to make a getaway, it turns to tragedy, and suddenly his future looks even darker. Thank goodness he has Patricia (Jean Seberg) by his side! The story is solid. Unfortunately, white captions on white backgrounds, so sometimes we miss what they are saying, unless your franÃ§ais is really good. Directed by JeanLuc Godard. Rated high on imdb, 7.8 as of today. And when they show it on Turner Classics, they sometimes include an interview, led by the (awesome but now deceased) host Robert Osborne. This was part of the 2021 film festival, virtual this year, due to ongoing pandemic issues. Sadly, miss Seberg died at 40 of an overdose. Belmondo was nominated for two Bafta's during the 1960s."
"'Jean-Luc Godard\'s New Wave romantic-drama, credited with starting a newly-raw and exciting cycle in French cinema, is thrilling solely as a visceral experience--but don\'t look for substance. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a thief on the run from police. He finds security with his moody American girlfriend played by Jean Seberg, looking lovely in a pixie haircut though seeming just a bit out of her element here. Raoul Coutard\'s crisp black-and-white cinematography provides atmosphere-atmosphere-atmosphere--and the movie looks good enough to eat--and yet it isn\'t much of a meal, only dessert. Godard isn\'t interested in a logical narrative; chasing after style, he did manage to break fresh ground with Breathless in 1960, and the charisma can still felt today. **1/2 from ****'"
"'In my opinion, Don\'t Look Now constitutes a real collision of different kinds of careers. Nicolas Roeg had already directed the surreal Walkabout, Donald Sutherland had starred in the humorous M*A*S*H, and Julie Christie had won an Oscar for the bleak Darling. So this one must have really blown people\'s minds when it came out. Portraying a couple losing a child to a drowning, and thereafter experiencing some rather unexplainable occurrences, the movie might make you question your own sanity. I will say that it\'s not outright scary, but those scenes on the river...well, just see if you can keep breathing normally after watching those.Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I did not see that ending coming (although I doubt that anyone could predict it). So do look now, and watch the movie...if you dare. Because he\'s right: nothing is what it seems.'"
"'Det sjunde inseglet (or, as the English-speaking world knows it, The Seventh Seal) is one of those movies that doesn\'t have any clear purpose; in a way, it\'s not supposed to. More than anything else, it looks at the questions that surround people in their lives, and shows that they don\'t necessarily have clear-cut answers. The ever-imposing Max Von Sydow plays Antonius Block, a Swedish knight returning home after having fought in the Crusades. He and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) meet Death (Bengt Ekerot). The not-so-Grim Reaper is of course planning to take the men to the afterlife, but the knight makes a most unusual deal: he and Death will play chess, and he will get to stay alive as long as he wins.Whether or not Antonius wins is not the point. The movie is a philosophical look not only at how the Bubonic Plague was affecting Europe, but probably also at how certain things are always creeping up on us. The final scene affirms this, and the movie affirms Ingmar Bergman as a director unlike any other.'"
"'Ingmar Bergman\'s career of brooding cinematic successes was practically borne here, in an amazing study of doomsday travelers in 14th century Sweden confronting their mortality. In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death\'s clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of faith and the heavy symbolism are often tough to wade through, while the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody. Still, The Seventh Seal is a must-see film, matching its iconic imagery with themes of the eternal struggle. *** from ****'"
"I saw this movie as a kid and I loved it, I saw it again just the other day and I loved it even more. I try my best to watch older movies and view them as if I was still in that era. Robin Williams does an phenomenal job as Popeye as does Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. Everyone was so animated and comical that you couldn't help but laugh, if not chuckle. There's not many feuds better than that between Popeye and Bluto. It was great the way they went at it. I liked the acrobatic stunts, the vibrancy of the characters, and the wholesomeness of the movie. It is a movie the entire family can enjoy. I would give it a better score except the singing was so awful. I give it a 7/10"
"I don't think that a video game has been adapted in such a manner before. It's as if you're watching the video game in front of your eyes. And although I only have played one Silent Hill, I know that they achieved to transport the game on your screen (theatre) literally!! But that is also the downfall of the movie (imo). It is very compelling in the beginning, but when it reaches a certain point (let's say the middle of the movie), the scares don't work anymore. The effects still remain great, but I'm just not feeling it. As a game that would work, because you're actively involved, but as a passive viewer, you get bored. So the best adaptation yet, shows us that there is more to the adaptation process, than filming a game ..."
"Superb ghost story starring George C Scott as a recently widowed pianist who moves to Seattle in an old mansion. That mansion is haunted by the restless spirit of a male child who will not stop until Scott seeks out the truth regarding his demise. The truths Scott finds along the way are quite stunning. Trish Van Devere plays Claire Norman, the woman who was his Realtor, and assists Scott in his pursuit of the truth. Melvyn Douglas(outstanding in his limited work on screen)is Senator Joseph Carmichael, someone who might have more to do with the ghost's identity than realized.It's everything I expect a good ghost story to be. The camera visuals and lighting of the house(especially that spooky attic Scott finds hidden and closed up where the ghost child's room was)are splendid, but the special effects are also solid. But, it's how the story develops that really worked for me. It isn't merely a special-effects laden exercise, but a legitimate mystery as well.Most ghost stories wish to show off their fancy effects, but this film slowly lets it's spooky stuff happen throughout the film more carefully. Scott is very good(not just sleep-walking like a lot of once-prominent actors tended to do in horror of the 80's)and his traumatic character's past is etched in pain on his face. A perfectly executed film on all counts."

"Retired composer tries to rebuild his life after witnessing his wife and child die in a freak auto accident; after moving into a renovated, historical mansion, he is drawn into the 70-year-old murder of a child which took place in the attic of his new residence. Solid scare-story with slamming doors and banging pipes. The obvious question comes up soon enough (though not with any of the characters on-screen): why would one man want to lease such a large estate, full of rooms he would never have any need of using? Plot-holes aside, as well as the brackish cinematography, there are many good scenes here, particularly an intense sÃ©ance (and its aftermath) and the digging up of human remains in a nearby house. In the lead, George C. Scott keeps a calm head throughout; he doesn't exude much of his personality with this role, but he acquits himself well with the spooky goings-on. As a paranoid politician who figures in the mystery, Melvyn Douglas has even less to work with than Scott. However, when these two splendid actors face off it makes for grand entertainment indeed. **1/2 from ****"
"'I found this to be a pretty solid haunted-house thriller...and better than I remembered so I have changed a few things in this review. The cinematography was admirable, mainly in the first half of the film and the special-effects near the end were excellent. That was capped off by a wheelchair chasing Trish Van Devere and a railing catching fire. In all, kind of bizarre and interesting scene.George C. Scott stars and Van Devere and an aged Melvyn Douglas provide noted supporting roles. There are very few dry spots and overall, its a decent horror film and not an expensive DVD purchase - so grab it, if you can. The suspense build beautifully. Nice direction by Peter Medak.'"
"'In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people.What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the Flash Gordon movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one.I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.'"
"'Now that I\'ve finally seen it I\'m kind of embarrassed to admit it. This film along with One Million Years B.C with Raquel Welch were a couple of the more highly publicized films of the mid-Sixties, neither one relying on much of a story to showcase it\'s lead actress. Watching today, I now know what I missed by not dropping acid during my college years. For myself, the only redeeming factor in checking out this flick was in directing me to learn how the British new wave band Duran Duran came up with it\'s name. I looked it up so you can to. Otherwise, the picture is more or less an hour and a half of soft porn interrupted by not much else. I did get a kick out of the scene when Barbarella got overwhelmed by all those parakeets and finches, a subliminal way that Jane Fonda\'s then husband and director Roger Vadim teased the male audience who might have wondered how she\'d handle all those little peckers.'"
"'I saw this movie while I was reading the novel, and the movie did a great job; it was literally as great as the novel. Gregory Peck won a well deserved Oscar for playing Atticus Finch, the lawyer in 1930s Alabama who is defending a black man wrongly accused of rape. The important point is that in the Deep South in the \'30s, it was unheard of (not to mention dangerous) for a white man to defend a black man. But the story is told from the point of view of his daughter Scout (Mary Badham), who gets taunted at school; everyone tells her that her daddy defends (N-words). One of the most touching scenes in To Kill a Mockingbird is when Atticus has to explain to Scout the whole situation and what the greater ramifications could be.I can\'t say with words how wonderful this movie is. I think that it was the first movie to deal with the race issue in America (at least the first major one). Some people have said that Gregory Peck\'s face belongs on a dollar bill, and I have to agree, judging from To Kill a Mockingbird.'"
"TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic adaption of a classic novel. I remember reading and watching this at school but most of the civil rights-era background when right over my head. Not really worth exploring a movie dealing with mature themes as a kid, but there you go. Watching it again as an adult, it's a delight and as hard-hitting as MISSISSIPPI BURNING, which came much later.I've always liked Gregory Peck and his laconic Atticus Finch is an exploration of a quiet, inherently decent man. It's a subtle performance of amazing strength, with no showy-off 'acting' scenes or the like; Peck's Oscar win was well deserved and it's a pity that Brock Peters didn't get best supporting actor for his excellent one-scene performance in which he relates his version of events to the courthouse.I particularly liked the way the narrative develops through the eyes of a pair of innocent children as it adds another layer to the story. The whole sub-plot involving Boo Radley is a classic bit of mischief and I love the way the two plots tie up neatly at the end. The child actors are exceptionally strong and despite the lengthy running time the movie doesn't have any slow spots; it's all relevant and adds to the experience. As I said, this is a great movie."
"'Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.What seems odd about this film is how it was made in the 1960s, looking at the 1930s. What would the same film have been like if it was made in the 1930s? Would the tone be different if not made during the civil rights movement? And, in some small way, did this film help push that movement forward? Now, this is not to say it is a bad film. It is a very good, and very timeless film. Bigotry is not dead, not by a long shot. And the belief that everyone deserves a strong defense should never go away, whether they are guilty or innocent, black or white, rich or poor.'"
"'OK, but not great. Music (by the Bee Gees) is fantastic, and the dance sequences are great. However, the human drama side is pretty uneventful and mostly quite dull. The characters, including the leads, are mostly so loathsome it is hard to feel any empathy.Performances are so-so. John Travolta does well in the lead role, seeming to inhabit the character. No real stand-outs, otherwise.Not a great movie, but a great piece of nostalgia from the disco days of the 1970s.'"
"'I can\'t say the hype for this movie came anywhere close to matching what it turned out to be - a very amateurish and, for the first two-thirds - boring film. I mean, let\'s me honest about this. The last 20 minutes is wild, no doubt, and fun to watch, even with super-primitive special-effects, but it doesn\'t make up for the root-canal-painfully slow and inane first 65 minutes.A bunch of high school girls wind up at Auntie\'s house for the night. En route, we get an hour of giggles and each one calling each other Gorgeous, Fantasy, Professor, Melody, Kung Fu and other assorted corny names. The fun doesn\'t really start until the last part when all hell breaks loose and the girls start fighting for their lives as the goofy house, led by the big white cat and the lonely evil aunt, seem to want to kill them all. That\'s after one or two of the girls had disappeared.Maybe 30 years ago, the FX looked cool, but they are so bad now if almost laughable.....so my advice to to rent the film and keep your expectations low, grind your way through the first hour and then you\'ll be sufficiently entertained at the end.Just because the overpriced Criterion line put this out, it doesn\'t mean it is some arty masterpiece. It is anything but that.'"
"'On my first viewing, I wasn\'t particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it\'s magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too. This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again. Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn\'t supposed to look good. That\'s one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim. He\'s amazing in this film. In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of Dragnet fame.This combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does.'"
"Joe Gillis (William Holden) is found shot and floating in the swimming pool of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Blvd. Six months earlier, Joe is a struggling screenwriter trying to sell his run-of-the-mill movie to producer Sheldrake but script reader Betty Schaefer belittles it. He's on the run from repo men and he hides his car in an old mansion. The mansion's owner turns out to be silent era movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She has delusions of making a 'return' to star in her script of Salome for legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Joe sees an easy way to make some money doing a rewrite. Slowly but surely, he becomes her kept man.Gloria Swanson gives an iconic performance for the ages. Her scenes on the Paramount lot are riveting. William Holden is great. It's a fascinating dissection of Hollywood and the fame obsession. There are a few moments of over-acting by some of the other actors which is weird since the movie is about the passing of the silent era acting. Norma Desmond has to be one of the top characters of all times."
"Spartacus is Kirk Douglas, and he doesn't mess around. He escapes the Romans and wants to kick their booties. Oh, and he has plenty of slaves to help him. Like, thousands. That's a whole lot of slaves.The film is pretty straightforward as far as the story goes -- slaves escape and return to kick butt. But it's some of the dialogue that is interesting. One man debates the moral difference between eating oysters and eating snails. To him, there is none, and that is analogous to sexual tastes... an interesting and probably enlightened perspective.The film is supposed to be anti-slavery, with Spartacus dreaming of a day where slavery ceases, which the narrator says will take another 2000 years. One wonders if Spartacus was all that concerned about the slavery of other races, or if slavery has truly been abolished. Over the years, it has risen again and again in different societies throughout the globe in various forms. Are we so advanced today we have entirely removed the shadow of slavery?"
"When I was young I used to love this cartoon, a lot more than the live action version with Glenn Close (although that was good too). Two lonely bachelors lived in London, a dog and a man. The dalmatian dog, Pongo, is the centre of attention. One day they both meet girlfriends and get married. Later the female dog, Perdita, has fifteen dalmatian puppies. A horrible woman named Cruella De Vil has terrorised the family and now kidnapped the puppies, with the help of Horace and Jasper, to make a puppy coat for her fur collection. A very good Walt Disney Pictures animated cartoon with some action, some laughs, and some cute puppies. I didn't actually know that Rod Taylor from The Birds did the voice of Pongo! It won the BAFTA Film Award for Best Animated Film. Cruella De Vil was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 66 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"
"Pongo was a carefree bachelor in London and then he decided that his pet Roger Radcliffe needed a mate. Pongo is a dalmatian. Then he spots Perdita walking with her human Anita. Anita's fur-loving friend Cruella takes a fancy to the 15 dalmatian pups. When Roger refuses to sell the puppies, Cruella hires thugs Jasper and Horace to kidnap the pups. They overpower Nanny and then hold up in a crumbling mansion with other dalmatian puppies. There are 99 puppies in total.Let's face it. Cruella De Vil is one of the more outlandish Disney villains. She isn't scary as much as silly. The movie opens with a fun rom-com story. I like the narration by Pongo. The movie stalls a little in the middle after the puppies have been stolen while the dogs haven't started on their search. It's a pretty short movie which is a good thing because it doesn't overstay its welcome."
"This is an iconic film, and anything I say in this review will not change that.It features some of the best film chemistry of all time in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and lots of great, often still quoted lines to this day.I enjoyed the film, I thought it had some great moments, but the western genre isn't really my thing and I can't say that I'd rush to see this film again.That's not to take away from its obvious quality though."

"I'm no big fan of John Wayne and truth be told I haven't watched very many of his films at all. My main interest in seeing RIO BRAVO is that it served as a big inspiration on John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and as a massive fan of Carpenter I knew I had to watch it. Having just watched it, I can report that it's an involved and engaging western, one with flaws but which overcomes these by offering strong action scenes and good characterisation. The similarities to the Carpenter film are fewer than expected, as this doesn't have any of the siege action I was expecting.The plot sees Wayne and his buddies holding a notorious criminal in their town jail while the guy's gang members and brother attempt to free him. There's little more to it than that, and it's a decent template for thrills and action. The shoot-outs in this film are well directed and exciting, and the large scale climax approaches brilliance. However, the film does drag in places with the overlong running time. Angie Dickinson is an arresting presence for sure, but her romance scenes with Wayne feel unnecessary (not to mention unbelievable). Dean Martin lends solid support as the drunken aide, but that whole sub-plot of him getting drunk and taken advantage of feels a bit redundant too. Still, it's a fine-looking film, and western fans will lap it up."
"'Growing up, I remember first watching the last 30 minutes of this movie on ABC during the \'80s when Jackie Gleason said sumbum instead of that other word. I later watched it on HBO where I heard all the uncensored words. After Burt Reynolds died yesterday, I suddenly looked online for all his movies and because I knew this was perhaps his most popular, I had to watch this again! Verdict: It\'s more hilarious than ever! Especially whenever Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice appears! And seeing him and Reynolds in a scene at a restaurant was priceless! Oh, and this was also the first time Burt and Sally Field were paired on film and in real life. My God, they were quite a pair at the time, weren\'t they! And then there\'s Jerry Reed who not only helps The Bandit and Frog along the way but also provides the songs in the movie especially the classic East Bound and Down which is such an iconic theme for not only this movie but also Burt Reynolds\' life. Oh, and director Hal Needham keeps the action going throughout, that\'s for sure! So that\'s a high recommendation of Smokey and the Bandit for anyone curious about what the appeal of Burt Reynolds was...Update: 9/12/18-Just watched this again with my movie theatre-working friend at his AMC place with a pretty good crowd though I only heard me and my friend laughing...'"
"Sly good ol' boy the Bandit (Burt Reynolds in peak amiable form) gets hired to haul 400 cases of beer from Texarkana to Atlanta in a mere 28 hours. Wily redneck trucker Cletus (a wonderfully spirited portrayal by Jerry Reed) helps the Bandit out while sweet runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field at her most adorable) tags along for the ride. Meanwhile, relentless and obsessive ramrod hick Sheriff Buford T. Justice (broadly played with lip-smacking brio by Jackie Gleason) gives hot pursuit. Director Hal Needham, working from a simple script by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer, and Alan Mandel, relates the entertainingly straightforward story at a constant swift pace, maintains an engaging good-natured tone throughout (although a lot of cars get wrecked, nobody ever gets seriously hurt), and milks the pleasantly irreverent humor for plenty of enormous belly laughs. Moreover, it's acted with real zest by an enthusiastic cast: Reynolds and Field display a strong and utterly charming natural chemistry, Gleason has a ball ad-libbing almost all of his hilariously profane dialogue, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Mike Henry as Justice's dim-witted son Junior, Pat McCormick as hearty blow-hard Big Enos, and Paul Williams as the sarcastic Little Enos. Bobby Byrne's sunny cinematography provides an attractive bright look. Further galvanized by a jaunty down-home score by Bill Justis, a first-rate rousing country soundtrack, and loads of well executed vehicular carnage, this affably unpretentious escapist fare sizes up as one immensely enjoyable romp."
"For the sake of this review I watched the entire movie, but I've got to say, it was a chore keeping my attention on the story. Criterion really dropped the ball on this one, they should have provided captioning for those of us who only speak English. I hardly understood a word spoken in the film, but I held out hope that the basic premise would reveal itself the way it has in other movies that I've had trouble following. No such luck. This thing started out way over the top and wound up just utterly stupid. I generally enjoy good parody but this seemed more like goofy slapstick. Could be I'm missing something because this gets a lot of credit by IMDb fans who's voting keep it in the Top #250. Maybe I'll try it again if I can find a copy with captioning, I'm open minded enough to give it another go. For now, my only positive takeaway was the Roman Centurion garb, those guys looked pretty sharp."
"'Okay, after 250 comments what\'s left to say. Personally, I took the movie as a send-up of those god-awful biblical costume epics of the 1950\'s. One\'s like The Silver Chalice (1954) or David and Bathsheba (1951), et al. You know, the kind that gave you 90 minutes of sex and violence and then 10 minutes of redeeming religiosity spread on with a trowel. That way you could enjoy the fun stuff without guilt, and Hollywood could show it had gotten rid of all those Commie screenwriters of the 1940\'s.I don\'t know how they did it, but this is the most realistic looking Holy Land that I\'ve seenâ the parched countryside, the magnificent battlements, the ragged crowds, etc. The budget couldn\'t have been that big, but the settings are impressive in their realismânot what you\'d expect from a send-up like this.Anyway, it\'s a funny movie. And if it doesn\'t exactly end with the voice of God, it does end on a humorously ironic noteâall those crucifees hanging there, singing Look on the Bright Side of Life. Beneath the black humor, there may well be real wisdom, and who\'s to say that this is not, in its own way, a voice from above.'"
"Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is a pompous brilliant linguist who boasts that he could turn cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady in 6 months. She's hounded by her drunken father (Stanley Holloway) for money. She wants to have lessons from Higgins and Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) makes a bet with him.This is a fun musical. As with some musicals of that era, Hepburn's singing is dubbed. No one would dare do that today, but one must not dismiss this movie for doing it back in the day. Hepburn plays the role older. It would help to play up her age. Her older age only helps to create chemistry between her and Harrison. Hepburn is as always very adorable. She is a brilliant comic actress. She and Rex Harrison are great foils for each other. This is a good funny acting duo."
"I used to think that the old B&W horror films from Universal in the '30s were the best of their kind--atmospheric and creepy.But Hammer's HORROR OF Dracula makes me realize that adding Technicolor and fangs to the proceedings, with a bombastic background score to emphasize every startling moment, really makes the Dracula tale come alive.The acting here is in the best British tradition with PETER CUSHING giving us a great Van Helsing and CHRISTOPHER LEE baring his fangs with blood-smeared lips to create the illusion of a perfect Dracula. MICHAEL GOUGH is also very effective as the man who helps Cushing when he realizes the truth about vampires.Production values are first rate with the color photography able to create just as much dark atmosphere as the old B&W cobweb settings did. I must emphasize that the jolts become more effective thanks to a marvelous score by James Bernard.Summing up: One of the best horror classics of its kind told in brisk style so that not a moment of screen time is wasted."
"Sticking closer to the time of Bram Stoker's novel, Horror Of Dracula was the\nsecond of many joint appearances of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. With\nfangs baring and a look of menace permanently on his countenance, Christopher\nLee became the new face of Dracula only two years after Bela Lugosi died. He\nbecame the new face of Dracula and unlike Lugosi who only made two appearances as the Count, Lee did quite a few more Dracula films.His Dr. Von Helsing is Peter Cushing also getting started in his career in horror\nfilms. These two were the mainstays of Hammer films and with their release\nin America became as known in America as they were in the United Kingdom.Also in the cast is Michael Gough who did a few horror flicks himself as a man\nwho loses a sister and her fiance to the evil blood drinking undead count and\nnearly loses another sister.The film is quite a bit more gory than the Lugosi classic which relied more on\nthe Gothic sets created at Universal Studios. Dracula deals in blood and that's\nwhat the movie going public got here and plenty of it.After 60 years and after 40 years when Hammer films went out of business,\nHorror Of Dracula hasn't lost a bit of bite."
"Groundbreaking, Irreverent, and Absolutely Audacious Black Comedy that was so Original and Over the Top that it could not be Anything but Controversial and Attract a Huge Audience that was Longing for this Type of Anti-Establishment Hollywood Movie. It was Certainly a Product of its time and was Unconventional in an Era when Unconventionality was Celebrated, at Least by People Under Thirty. it is a Movie that was Breaking Bad with No Apologies. It seems Today, rather Tame, but at the Time it Showed Itself to be Cutting Edge in so Many Ways.Lots of on Screen Blood, Jokes about Homosexuality, Impotence and Pubic Hair. Hard Pokes at Authority, Especially the Military, Marital Infidelity, and Racism. It was the First Movie to use the F-Word. The Playful Cast Improvised Director Robert Altman's Vision of Hard Working Life Saving Surgeons in an Impossible Situation with Breezy, Overlapping, Improvisational Dialog, Punctuated with Sarcasm and Wit.Seminal Film, to say the Least, it may seem Somewhat Dated Today and has the Eleven Season TV-Show Haunting its Reputation, but Except for the Ill-Advised, Unfunny, Boring, Slapstick of a Football Game that is the Third Act, the First Two-Thirds can be Considered Influential, Gonzo-Filmmaking at its Best."
"In those long ago, pre-video days, the only way I could get enough of this movie was multiple visits to the cinema.The long running TV series was good but, inevitably, diluted considerably in order to be piped into living rooms. But you had to make a choice to go and see the movie, and it is savage. Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan, in particular, are drawn very differently here than the rather amiable buffoons portrayed in the TV series.The characters are somewhere they don't want to be, having to do things they don't want to do, and this gives rise to a laxity in behaviour none of them would consider in civilian life. The movie is necessarily episodic as the characters seek activities to keep their morale sufficiently high to make life bearable until they can finally return home.Everything about this film is brilliant, from the script and direction to all the performances. Sutherland and Gould were the headliners, of course, but everyone in this was excellent, and it's a shame that some of the careers which this film promised (Bud Cort, Jo Ann Pflug) never really materialised.Oh, and I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but it's very funny."
"'What made the spaghetti westerns different from John Wayne movies and such was that they showed the Old West as violent and gritty, and the people as dirty (the John Wayne movies portrayed the Old West as fancy and the people as good, clean Christians). Per un pugno di dollari (called A Fistful of Dollars in English) definitely showed the dismal side. The plot of course has The Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) arriving in a small town and playing two groups off against each other.Obviously, Sergio Leone\'s spaghetti westerns are the ones against which all others should be judged. This one not only had two sequels, but also paved the way for Leone directing Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time in America. It\'s not exactly a great movie, but definitely a groundbreaking one. As it was, 1964 saw a number of groundbreaking things: the Beatles coming to America, Dr. Strangelove, and the Civil Rights Act.And yes, when my parents were in Spain in 1992, they drove through the town where this was filmed. They could clearly see that it looked like the town in the movies.'"
"It's 1943. 2000 British troops are trapped on the island of Keros in the Aegean Sea. The Nazis are about to launch a massive assault in six days. Any escape is blocked by two massive guns on the island of Navarone. Air attacks has been useless. The Allies send in mountaineer Captain Keith Mallory (Gregory Peck), defeated Greek Colonel Andrea Stavrou (Anthony Quinn), explosive expert Corporal Miller (David Niven), former Navaronite Greek-American Spyros Pappadimos (James Darren), and knife fighter/engineer Butcher Brown (Stanley Baker). They are led by Major Roy Franklin (Anthony Quayle). They have to take out the guns before 6 British destroyers make a run for Keros.The action is good but a bit old fashion. The action at sea in the storm does get a little confusing. It's not as exciting as I want. The cliff climbing is also very fake with obvious painting and interior sets. Even the shooting and battles are very static. The cameras don't seem to move. I also wish they stop throwing dummies over a big drop. It's obvious that those are mannequins. At least, they are putting a lot of men and equipment on the screen in some of the filler scenes. As for the story, it gets a little gritty for its time while it's also slow in some stretches. The actors are generally too old for the roles. However that gives the movie a world-weary feel. It's good because they are even more of an underdog group."
"Brazen, rambunctious, lascivious comedy, expertly written by Billy Wilder (who also directed) and I.A.L. Diamond from a story by R. Thoeren and Michael Logan. High-spirited slapstick, with both sharp and soft edges, involves two luckless Prohibition-era musicians in Chicago who inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre; they take it on the lam after disguising themselves as women, becoming part of an all-female jazz combo! Hilarious film still delivers the goods, from Tony Curtis' Cary Grant impression (to win over chanteuse Marilyn Monroe) to Jack Lemmon inexplicably falling for a wacky elderly millionaire (the priceless Joe E. Brown). Only in the more subdued seduction scenes between Curtis and Monroe does the film's pacing flag; otherwise, boffo entertainment. ***1/2 from ****"
"'A young Clint Eastwood and the late Lee Van Cleef star in this typical spaghetti western.An alternate title may have been Mutiny Among The Bounty Hunters.The film starts off with the exploits of Van Cleef and Eastwood as bounty hunters. They shoot their hearts off and along the way, they collect nice money while lodging bullets in the heads of their wanted outlaws.Their big task is to get a noted outlaw, who with a group of 15 others, is planning a major bank robbery. Turns out that one of the bounty hunters wants him for personal reasons as well.The film is often slow paced. It\'s entirely too violent for our tastes. The scene where our major bandit blows away a young mother and her 18 month old is not shown but you feel the emotion when the gun goes off and off.'"
"With the success of A Fistful Of Dollars you knew a sequel had to be made and\nClint Eastwood left the small screen for good as Rawhide concluded its run and\nhe was back in Europe for another pasta western with Sergio Leone. Making\nthe trip with Eastwood was Lee Van Cleef and the two play a pair of bounty\nhunters after the outlaw Gian Maria Volante and his gang of cutthroats. The\nusual amount of bloody mayhem was dished out by Eastwood, Van Cleef and\nthe gang itself.The treat in this film is watching Eastwood and Van Cleef taking each other's measure and circling around each other like a pair of jungle cats\nwaiting to pounce on each other. It's one uneasy partnership.If you liked A Fistful Of Dollars you will most certainly like For A Few Dollars\nMore. This one solidified Clint Eastwood as a box office draw. As for Van Cleef he got out of supporting ranks and played if not out and out bad guys,\ncertainly rather sardonic good guys for the most part in the rest of his career.Another heaping helping of pasta."
"'Sergio Leone\'s second installment in his spaghetti-western trilogy with lead actor Clint Eastwood (following 1964\'s A Fistful of Dollars and in turn followed by 1966\'s The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly). Bounty hunter Clint spars with gunslinger Lee Van Cleef amidst a great many dirt-town and saloon shoot-outs. Sweaty atmospherics, some exciting sequences (including a terrific finish), but Leone\'s pacing is unbelievably dogged. Although the films in this canon have a tricky kind of symbolism which underline the finished product with a bracing, immediate quality that can be quite gripping for an audience, they are not deep-thinkers, and after the first hour it becomes blurry with noisy violence. *1/2 from ****'"
"What's not to love about BEN-HUR? It's a film that tells an epic story in an epic way, filling every shot with artistry and colour until the screen overflows with splendour. Despite a lengthy running time, the pacing never flags. The episodic structure of the storyline works in the film's favour, ably chronicling the adventures of the titular character as he undergoes a thrilling journey to hell and back.It has Charlton Heston playing his most famous role and being incredibly manly and heroic in it. It has a cast of seasoned performers in support, not least Jack Hawkins as the sympathetic Roman. It has Stephen Boyd as a truly nasty piece of work villain. It has the most spectacular and complex action sequence ever put on film in the shape of the chariot race, which is just as thrilling and breathtaking as it was when it was first released in cinemas back in the day.And, finally, it's a film engages the senses and the emotions. It never forgets, amid all the glory and the epic wonder of the scenery and action, that this is a human story about real people struggling with their lives. There's a message there for any viewer, Christian or otherwise, and that's the reason why BEN-HUR hasn't dated a day since it was first released. It's a true classic for a reason."
"'When Network first came out, it probably seemed like a warning of what could happen. Now, in the age of infotainment-mergers-etc, it\'s amazing how accurate they were. Actually, Network isn\'t really about mergers as much as TV stations getting taken over by organizations that have nothing to do with news (sound familiar, people?). When anchorman Howard Beale\'s (Peter Finch in an posthumous Oscar-winning role) ratings drop, the network fires him, and he flips on air. So, the network decides to exploit this. And exploit it they do. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in an Oscar-winning role) is the epitome of the bitchy, business-obsessed executive woman; she talks about business even when having sex. All in all, it\'s impressive how real this movie looks today.'"
"'Blistering, dead-on indictment of today\'s television business, a \'satire\' only in retrospect (as screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky might attest to). I\'m amused at the comments from students who viewed this film in class, writing, It was a good movie for its time. A good movie is great for any time, and Network is a great movie. Posthumous Best Actor Oscar winner Peter Finch gives a harrowing performance as a TV news-anchor whose slipping sanity is used and abused by the network big-wigs; Best Actress winner Faye Dunaway is the sharp, soulless producer drowning deliriously in her work (she wants a separate life away from her job, but doesn\'t want to make compromises or pay any prices); Beatrice Straight won the Supporting Actress Oscar for small but solid role as William Holden\'s neglected wife; however, it is William Holden\'s work as an executive from the news division who holds the picture together, bringing it a current of sanity and logic. Holden struggles, he tries to do the right thing, he grits his teeth and covers his eyes at what he sees. Holden is positively amazing. It may be the finest performance of his long, esteemed career. Network is a wild and bumpy ride with mostly despicable people, and I laughed throughout the madness. ***1/2 from ****'"
"' . . . Such lovely hair, Frank praises serial killer Wren, who\'s just poisoned him with potassium cyanide. Normally Wren specializes in matricide, as she\'s already killed HER mother and HIS on the very spot Frank\'s expiring. Wren is thoroughly convincing as a 13-year-old murderess. Viewers can picture her becoming some sort of extended care facility employee, or home health care aide, who easily gets away with dozens if not hundreds of mercy killings. As she raptly soaks in Frank\'s last gasps, the expression on Wren\'s face proves that such moments provide her with the ultimate sensual pleasure. It\'s easy to picture THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE soon morphing into THE ASSASSIN WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY OF WARD B WHO ALWAYS WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT.'"
"'Jodie Foster has been one of the most renowned actresses for almost forty years, not to mention one of the most versatile. Pretty much all cinephiles know about her roles in Taxi Driver and Silence of the Lambs. But one role with which you might not be familiar is the 1976 thriller The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane. Part indictment of hebephilia, part reminder that children aren\'t as immature as you might think, this is an impressive one.Obviously, a few of the scenes look inappropriate; I get the feeling that one scene in particular couldn\'t get on screen nowadays. Sometimes called a horror movie, it\'s more psychological thriller, slowly building up Foster\'s character and revealing her disturbing tendencies. And I recommend it. The protagonist\'s innocent appearance hides a manipulative, sociopathic side. Mind you, there are some parts that will shock you (and I don\'t mean anything dealing with death). Perfect movie to watch on Halloween (as I did).'"
"'Disappointingly unfunny early Murray vehicle has him at an outdoors camp with young women, etc. Bring on the filthy jokes!I saw this years ago, on public television, and I don\'t remember very much about it. I do remember that I found it disappointing and quite dry, without many laughs at all and Murray--fresh off SNL--had not yet perfected the dry comedy in a mainstream movie that he would show much better in Stripes (1981) under the guidance of Ivan Reitman. Here, it\'s just not very funny.2/5 stars.John Ulmer'"
"'Canada\'s Camp North Star is the setting for summer fun. In the opening scene, groggy camp counselor Bill Murray (as Tripper Harrison) doesn\'t seem up for the job.

Otherwise, we focus on the CITs (counselors-in-training). A lot of youthful co-ed skin (but no nudity) mixed with sex talk (but no action) made Meatballs a safe hit at the box office. Later camp films lowered the bar.***** Meatballs (6/28/79) Ivan Reitman ~ Bill Murray, Chris Makepeace, Kate Lynch, Russ Banham'"
"'Unfortunately, it appears that I saw Dario Argento\'s best film, Suspiria, first, and none of the ones I\'ve seen subsequently measure up to that one.All of the imagination Argento could muster for this serial killer story went in to staging a few elaborate and gruesome murder scenes. Too bad that all of the scenes connecting those moments are a dull bore. And the movie overstays its welcome by at least half an hour.What seemed novel in Suspiria begins to seem like limitations when you realize that Argento couldn\'t do anything else. His attention to style can only go so far in making up for the lack of good plotting, acting, character development and just about everything else that separates good films from bad ones.Grade: C-'"
"For a while, one needs a scorecard to keep track of all the players. As Redford and Neuman light up the screen, we have an incredible intertwining of characters and motivations playing off each other, leading to the final con. What works is that we have a simple motivation that sets it all up. That is the murder of a friend. All else is directed at that central issue. Soon, the masters of the Sting begin to set up the dominoes, They match bad guys against bad guys, create artificial settings, maneuver things in an orchestrated way. Not everything works perfectly. There are some unexpected pitfalls, including a near-fatal mistake, but the beauty is that these villains are almost excited to be separated from their money. One of the really bright spots of the 1970's."
"I had been putting off watching Sunshine for ages, believing it to be nothing more than an overblown, CGI packed, 'disaster/end of humanity' film along the lines of Armageddon. Having just finished the film, I can report that, although there are plenty of CGI effects, Sunshine is nothing of the sort: it's actually a boring, pretentious, and sober piece of 'serious' sci-fi that makes little or no senseâone that makes me almost wish I'd popped Michael Bay's asteroid crap-fest in my DVD player instead.The film starts off promisingly enough, with the crew of the spacecraft Icarus II killing time until they arrive at their destination, the Sun, where they hope to 'restart' the dying star by dropping a massive bomb into its heart. Things starts to go 'tits-up', however, once the crew discover the remains of a previous failed mission and attempt to recover its payload (in order to double their chances of success); at this point, Sunshine gradually becomes nothing more than a glut of confusing special effects designed to mask the fact that the script has become an indecipherable mess.In fact, Sunshine is so bad, I find it almost impossible to believe that it came from the same man that gave us the excellent 28 Days Later, and who would, soon after, receive the Academy Award for Best Director. It's a strange old world."
"'A really rather dreary depiction of two young people from pretty dysfunctional backgrounds who get together - with her baby from another relationship - and struggle through life. Ryan Gosling is Dean a working class man quite content to make his way as a handy man/painter; Michelle Williams Cindy a nurse who has (slightly) greater aspirations for both of them, and her little girl. The story is delivered in threads that try to reconcile their separate, rather depressing, routes to their current predicaments alongside their present issues. Certainly there was love, once, in their relationship but that has long been supplanted by resentment, frustration and even some jealousy before it all culminates with a rather disastrous romantic night in an hotel. The relentless inevitability of the story is writ large from the start, and although the film is well put together, it cannot elevate it from the realms of a rather drab, angry melodrama.'"

"'Yesterday was Farrah Fawcett\'s 60th birthday (and it\'s good hear that she\'s cancer-free after a bout with it), so I wanted to review one of her movies, although she isn\'t the lead role in Logan\'s Run. This is one of those \'70s sci-fi movies that had a tinge of the counterculture in it, what with how Logan (Michael York) seeks to run away from this seemingly ideal society. I mean, let\'s face it: wasn\'t part of the social movement in the \'60s a rejection of middle-class mores?True, the movie does have a slightly hokey \'70s feel to itself - the sets, the music - but I find it hard not to like. And the idea of people getting discarded at thirty certainly reflects our young-celebrity-obsessed culture. Worth seeing. Also starring Richard Jordan, Jenny Agutter (looking as hot as ever) and Peter Ustinov.'"
"'Successful California Gold Rush prospector Lee Marvin (as Ben Rumson) is in his element after digging a grave for the brother of singing cowboy Clint Eastwood (as Pardner). A self-described boozing man, Mr. Marvin likes to live under the influence. Like Mr. Eastwood, Marvin also likes to sing. The two men become companions, sealing their relationship with a simple exchange: Marvin says, I like you Pardner, and Eastwood says, I like you Ben. Since they are heterosexual, Marvin buys beautiful Jean Seberg (as Elizabeth) to be their wife. At $800, Ms. Seberg\'s a steal.Simply put, Paint Your Wagon is a too long, stupid, and wasteful movie.

Then, think about the fun in casting Elizabeth. The mind boggles. Anyway, the musical highlights are Marvin\'s Wandrin\' Star (late in the film) and Harve Presnell\'s They Call the Wind Mariah (early in the running time). Ray Walston is a supporting asset, and Tom Ligon catches on fast.** Paint Your Wagon (10/15/69) Joshua Logan ~ Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Jean Seberg'"
"'This is a fine adaptation of Lerner & Loewe\'s tale of the escapades of two prospectors on the hunt for gold, whisky and a wife... Clint Eastwood, the slightly more sophisticated tea-totaller, is actually quite a revelation as Pardner; yep - he can actually hold a tune alongside the wonderfully curmudgeonly Lee Marvin Ben Rumson. When a Mormon gent arrives in No Name City he decides to auction one of his wives; Marvin makes a purchase and soon there is an uniquely amicable little mÃ©nage Ã\xa0 trois going on with their wife Jean Seberg - the no-nonsense Elizabeth. The story does take quite a while to get going, but the three principals with the help of some wonderful orchestrations (Nelson Riddle at the helm) of Wandrin\' Star; They Call the Wind Maria & I Talk to the Trees all deliver really rather well (if, perhaps not quite so tunefully by Marvin). The actors are having great fun amongst the rain, mud and poverty - and that fun can at times be quite contagious; there are some really enjoyable ensemble scenes/numbers too. The story is, however, strung out far too thinly over what seemed like an age and though there are some quite pithy one liners, the comedy is equally sparsely distributed throughout this all but three hour film. The last ten minutes are quite an achievement for the scenery/props folks as we almost end up where we started... It\'s entertaining fun....'"
"'Retired jewel thief living in a lavish villa on the French Riviera is accused of being notorious bauble-burglar The Cat, currently scaling the rooftops of the swankiest hotels in France; he sets out to discover who\'s copying his moves. Alfred Hitchcock and company on vacation; the film is a swirling, costumed, powder-puffed piece of eye-candy, and none of it leaves the slightest impression whatsoever. Cary Grant (looking overly-tanned) glides through the picture with a bemused smirk, while Grace Kelly fills her gowns (and Grant\'s arms) beautifully. Grace, playing the pampered, school-perfected daughter of a wealthy American, purrs seductively into Cary\'s ear during a fireworks show, asking him to finger the jewels around her neck; moments later, when her own mother\'s jewels have gone missing, she turns into an enraged, accusatory woman-scorned. Why? Because screenwriter John Michael Hayes (working from David Dodge\'s novel) can\'t come up with anything plausible or substantial to move this story along. Therefore, few of these characters acts in a sensible way, leaving us little to do but sit back and admire their wardrobes and surroundings. It passes the time. **1/2 from ****'"
"'one of the eccentric films who could be defined as awful movie with few great performances. the pillar remains, after a half of century, Rex Harrison. Richard Burton does his best efforts for define a character who is only a nice sketch of the script. Elizabeth Taylor has just the status of perfect support. for costumes, for lights, for kitsch, for romanticism, for an obscure end, for the title. because its a project of pure ambition to impress. images at first. costumes, people, heroic moments, slices of fake Egypt and few crumbs of acting. too long, too expensive, too strange for the lost of sense in many scenes. picture of the self image of Hollywood, it is only a proof about the ambitions of a period. nothing bad. if the delicate traces of a possible masterpiece are ignored.'"
"'Small town Texas lives in 1951: the teenage girls are busy thinking about boys and marriage, while their boyfriends take sex in stride. All the while, time is ticking away on their adolescence, and turning their community into a shadow of its former self. The Last Picture Show was only Peter Bogdanovich\'s second directorial achievement, which won critical raves so filled with exaltation that it immediately put the noses of his competitors and counterparts out of joint (Bogdanovich was nominated for a Best Director Oscar, but lost). This adaptation of Larry McMurtry\'s novel, by McMurtry and Bogdanovich, is an unblushing look at randy, impatient young people and their elders, most of whom are living in the past. It has a somewhat cynical eye (often for a comedic affect), but also an intimate spirit and a dazzle that sweeps the audience up. You can\'t help but be moved by it, with those rich, warm echoes of Hank Williams songs on the radio and screen-doors squawking in the dusty wind. It\'s a touchstone movie, and has stood the test of time. Superlative performances by an amazing cast; Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson won well-deserved Supporting Oscars. Bogdanovich revisited these lives in 1990 with Texasville. ***1/2 from ****'"
"William Shakespeare's much-beloved romantic tale--narrated by no less a grand interpreter of Shakespeare than Laurence Olivier himself!--has the two lovers of Verona (Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey) doomed by the fates and their warring families. This heavy-lidded endeavor (previously filmed in 1936 and 1954) would seem to be quite swoon-worthy at the outset, yet overall it is more proficient technically rather than emotionally, as the acting leads (teenagers themselves) are pretty but vacuous. Supporting performances from Milo O'Shea and Michael York are perhaps more memorable. The costumes and Pasquale De Santis' cinematography won the picture its only Oscars, fitting since the film is really all style. ** from ****"
"This is a film like no other. Set in a period of great strife in a place of cold violence and indifference. This is a love story and a story of revolution. This is a portrayal of what is worst in humankind and what is best. We have a love story that transcends the elements and carries on to future generations. These are excellent performances by Julie Christie and Omar Shariff and impeccable direction by David Lean, who has produced some of the greatest works of the cinema. As we travel the endless vistas of the Soviet landscape we are given a taste of the Russia of the time, but there is threat at every turn. The young Yuri is shown the ugliness of politics at an early age and must confront this throughout his life. He is a man of great courage and compassion. If you've never seen this, by all means do so."
"'Luke has had a bad drunk night, and ends it by cutting the heads off of parking meters. This doesn\'t go well with the police, and he is given two years on a chain gang.While Paul Newman\'s career was long and memorable, I think that Cool Hand Luke possibly ranks as his most memorable. Newman is something of an anti-hero, where we love him despite his faults and hope to see him escape from his captors, though we know full well that he is guilty of the crime for which he is interred.The most memorable scene? Of course, the egg-eating scene with fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Amazing (though far from any sort of record). I have read that this scene is supposed to have some sort of Christian symbolism. I\'m not entirely convinced, and won\'t be until I hear it from the creators, but it\'s an interesting theory.'"
"'Heavy-handed western about eleven young boys becoming men while on rigorous cattle drive. Crude and violent, it\'s probably John Wayne\'s worst movie next to The Conqueror. Bruce Dern, as another in his stable of wild-eyed villains, overdoes it once again, and in his last scene with Wayne vilified himself for years to come. The film, poorly directed by Mark Rydell, has no western nostalgia for the past, and no soul-searching for a future. It\'s all laid out in a bland, barren fashion, without anybody to care about and children one would cross the street in order to avoid. Wayne does his usual walk-through, but kids don\'t seem to be his thing (he\'s not much of a father-figure, more like a ornery distant relative). Highly inflated, nauseatingly self-righteous and self-important.'"
"'Lesser-known John Wayne gem.Set in the 1870s, a veteran rancher, Wil Anderson (played by John Wayne), needs to drive his large herd of cattle to market, over 600 kms away. However, his hired hands have deserted him for the goldfields. As a last resort he hires a group of boys from the local school as his drivers...cowboys in the truest sense of the word. What follows is a journey of discovery and a transformation of boys to men...Not your typical John Wayne movie. Wayne is less of the hero here, and more a paternal figure. After all, he was 65 years old when this movie was made, so his days of acting the invincible hero were behind him. However, for all the one-dimensional casting of him as a hero, here he shows a more balanced aspect to his acting. Interesting plot, with a dramatic, un-John Wayne-like twist near the end. Plot development, and some scenes, can be clumsy at times though.As mentioned, good performance from John Wayne. Good work from Bruce Dern, as the villain, plus all of the supporting cast, including the boys.'"
"It's 1960 San Francisco. Bank robber Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) has tried too many escapes and is brought to Alcatraz where no one has ever escaped from. He befriends Litmus with his mouse and becomes Wolf's enemy. English (Paul Benjamin) runs the library. It turns out that English is the top among the blacks. Charley Butts moves into the next cell. Brothers Clarence Anglin and John Anglin (Fred Ward) join Frank in Alcatraz after a failed escape.It's a nice prison movie with all the horrors that entails and an escape scheme. It's a bit slow and lacks a truly scary opponent. The warden is nothing special. Patrick McGoohan doesn't have enough threatening presence. Wolf is too soft and goes away for much of the movie. I wish more is done with the antagonists of the movie. Nevertheless, it's a good escape movie. Clint is at the top of his game."
"The Gods demand the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or they will unleash the Kraken against the city of Argos. Perseus (Sam Worthington), demigod son of Zeus, accepts the task to fight the Kraken. To fight the Kraken, he discovers that he needs the head of Medusa.They got some big names to play gods including Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes. Gemma Arterton plays Io who guide the quest. This is chalk full of CG battles. The biggest problem with that is the rush to put it in 3D. Many complaints follow, but if you watch it in 2D, there shouldn't be any problems. The acting is basically stiff. Sam Worthington is not a natural acting, but he has the built to be heroic. It does get too chaotic, but it's pretty watchable."
"'Is it always good for a son to be like the father? This is a movie based on real events surrounding the disappearance of Kathie McCormack (Dunst). Under mysterious circumstances she disappeared and though her husband Robert (Gosling) was suspected no one was ever brought to trial. The movie opens and we find out that was Robert was seven years old he saw his mom violently die in front of him, and through out the movie we see the effect this had on him. This is a good, but very slow moving movie. This is a different role for Kirsten Dunst, who hasn\'t taken on a part like this since Virgin Suicides, and she did a good job with it. The movie\'s strength is the performance of Ryan Gosling who is excellent at playing a seemingly normal guy with major psychological issues. It was such a convincing performance that every time he is on screen you will tense up. Overall it was a good movie, but I was expecting more. Acting was really good though. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don\'t think I would'"
"Andrew Jarecki, director of the acclaimed, ambiguous documentary 'Capturing the Friedmans', returns here to the subject of troubled families, with his account of the life of David Marks. The film must come dangerously close to libel, being based on the real life of Robert Durst, who was twice acquitted of murder (suffice it to say Jarecki does not seem so convinced by his plea of innocence). The film begins by painting a sympathetic portrait, of a man bullied by his tyrannical family, but soon begins showing us a less flattering side. Ulimtatley, the story lacks resolution, and a drama extrapolated from the truth like this is always in danger of falling between two stools: one expects a made-up story to attain different standards to one that is merely representing what happened. There's a high-class cast, but ultimately the film lacks both the cohesion of fiction and the compulsion of truth."
"Sometimes you wonder why a production team doesn't cut a movie when they're making it, having the obvious realisation that what they're making is dreadful, surely it's more financially damaging to complete and release a diabolical mess like this, then it would have been to say stop. The premise seems good, two of the writers from Scary movie take the spoof them to a bigger scale, but do it so badly. It's unfunny, it could be deemed offensive, there is virtually nothing positive I can say about it, the acting is unforgivable in this day and age, it smacks of 1980's b movie all the way through, I realise they were up against it with the script, but come on. Do something more useful, like clean the bathroom, 1/10."
"This movie is awful. It did make me laugh about a 3's worth, but there was so much bad that i had to drop it to a 2. Cringeworthy, random, obnoxious, gross, lame, slapstick garbage. It was jaw-droppingly bad numerous times (about 2 viewings, 3/27/2021)"
"'Disaster Movie was a horribly unfunny and pathetic film. Likewise, Epic Movie is also horribly unfunny and pathetic...but at least it was slightly better! Unlike Disaster Movie, this one actually had two or three laughs--very small laughs, but laughs nonetheless.Like Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie and 174 other recent movies, this one is a rapid-fire parody of many recent movies. And, like all these other films, it\'s mostly crappy--with very few laughs. The jokes are rapid-fire but unlike the original film of this type, Airplane, the jokes never worked. They would have been better off in hindsight to just stop making these sort of terrible films a lot time ago but they have continued for one reason alone--many teenagers are so stupid and sheep-like that they\'ll go see anything!!! Nothing else could explain the proliferation of these crap-tastic films.Some of the parodied films include The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, Harry Potter, X-Men, Snakes on a Plane and The DaVinci Code and it could have been funny. The problem, however, is that the writing was absolutely pathetic and it truly appears as if no one cared. After all, not giving a darn is the only way that would explain how a Harry Potter parody has not a single laugh! Overall, a bore-fest with lousy writing, acting and direction that appears as if the director was just punching a time clock--hoping the unfunny mess would just finish itself quickly so they could go on to the next slap-dash production.'"
The worst akshay Kumar movie in the past few years. Screenplay was horrible. Performances of the supporting cast were awful (overacting). Akshay Kumar ad shared Kelker were the only good performances. Good topic but the execution was horrible. The casting was also really bad akshay Kumar (53) plays the son in law. Many Rishi (43) plays the brother in law. And Rajesh sharma the youngest (40) plays the fatherðð. Just don't even think about watching this film and go and watch Ludo instead this Diwali.

"'A remake of south by a southern but just got lost from the start of the movie. The movie is having a good topic but just terribly, senselessly and horribly made. Scenes are literally enforced not to forgot the songs, which were having no timings at all.At the end of day, even Akshay Kumar can give such bad movies.'"
"Fun movie actually. The first part however was very irritating. The plot was there and the actors were there. Some better treatment should have been given to the movie.\nAkshay kumar was good but he was also very irritating in some parts of the movie. Did'nt liked the part where movie went loud unnecessary.Its a decent timepass, you will get your share of laughter."
My Rating : 1/10What is this? Great waste of time if that's your thing.Have fun.
"'Not withstanding the historical inaccuracies I will stick with entertainment value of this movie. If somebody allowed me to summon this movie in one short sentence Outdated with clichÃ©d dialogs would be it. Ranveer Singh & Arjun Kapoor were never in it, if you know what I am saying. Besides hamming it up and showing off their six packs the actors impact in the movie were minimal. Two of the songs were good and the only saving grace of the movie. I believe Yash Raj Films instinctively knew this & therefore didn\'t over utilize it in their promos. The storyline and treatment were so bland that by the time the story meandered to its end the audience didn\'t give a rat\'s pa tut how it finished, as long as it finished. Poor Poor version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Feel sorry for the suckers who got conned into watching this movie.'"
"'Gunday follows a familiar territory of best friends turning foes for their common love. What follows is an action packed story of petty thieves turning into the city\'s biggest outlaws and a cop relentlessly following the criminal duo. Such stories used to be favorite among the \'70s film makers. Story-wise, the film isn\'t more than an average \'70s action film full of improbabilities. You can\'t just digest Ranvir Singh and Arjun Kapoor as the most notorious bandits of Calcutta in the 80s as the film projects nor the police action against them looks much realistic. Overall, Gunday is weak in its story with unlovable characters and tastelessness. Performance wise too, the film falls short for the under performed roles of Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra. If the film grips a little, it\'s for the fast pace and the technical aspects of the film.Rating: 1 star out of 4'"
"Battlefield Earth (2000): Dir: Roger Christian / Cast: John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kelly Preston, Kim Coates: One of the lowest forms of idiocy since Roger Christian's previous crap Masterminds. It addresses the idea of earth as a wasteland in a screenplay that goes from bad to worse right up to its ridiculous conclusion where violence solves everything. Idiot plot regards man as an endangered species made slaves to the nine-foot tall Psychos who is the head security adviser wishing to leave Earth but his request is turned down. To get revenge he secretly has human slaves dig mines so that he may possess the gold for himself. Among the slaves is Barry Pepper who was on an expedition from his village before his capture. Horrible directing by Christian with John Travolta delivering one of his worst performances. He even sounds bad delivering dialogue that consists of name calling. Barry Pepper spends much time dangling from Travolta's grasp. Forest Whitaker plays Travolta's henchman and that is about the height of his involvement. Kelly Preston appears in a cameo because when you're married to the film's star then it is only right that you suffer for the same bad career decisions. The production values are well done otherwise the extent of the screenplay seems to be a pointless ugly stupid mess. This film should be tossed in a bomb fire. Score: 2 / 10"
"It's the year 3000. Earth has long been conquered by the Psychlos. Humans are used as work slaves. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) leaves his remote tribe to explore. He finds some surviving humans. The Psychlos capture him and others to use as slaves. Terl (John Travolta) is a Psychlo who is stuck on earth after crossing a senator. With new pay cuts coming to the labor force, Terl has the idea to train the human slaves to operate machinery and replace the paid labor. It's a secret and illegal initiative with the help of his second Ker (Forest Whitaker). They use a learning machine on Jonnie. Eventually Jonnie learns enough to start a revolt.This is an universally panned movie and it deserves it. It is ugly looking. The plot is badly written. Travolta's acting is too ridiculous. The sad part is that all of them are deliberate choices. They are all simply wrong choices. There is a nugget of an interesting idea in here somewhere. Enslaved humanity revolting against an alien mining company could maybe work. Pepper is a pretty good actor but he's overwhelmed. Whatever hope this had is lost pretty quickly."
"'What were they thinking of when they made this movie? John Travolta acted like he was in a broadway play(the way he spoke and acted mainly), the characters had horrible interactions, the so called alien species, whom John Travolta plays look like humans with tubes and dreadlocks, and the special effects and plot was incredibly stupid. My last words after renting this from the movie store were, I demand a refund!'"
"As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.Why do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.The film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.Overall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
"First of all, it wouldn't make any sense watching this movie if you don't know the movies it is spoofing. But then again, it doesn't make sense (to me) to watch this movie after all even if you know the movies that are being spoofed. What I mean is, I knew/recognised the movie-references and couldn't laugh, a friend of mine didn't recognise any, but didn't laugh either ...Now the question is, how can you spoiler this movie without spoiler(ing?), all the movies that it has stolen .. ah I mean paid tribute to? I think it's not possible, but then again, a movie that makes fun of Ms. Lopez famous body part in a never-ending sequence, might be not the movie you want to spoiler! (if this sentence didn't make sense to you watch the movie, and you'll understand ... nothing!) ;o) Anyways, I know that there a few people out there that liked the movie (someone even told me the other day, so I know for sure), but if you can't completely shut down your brain, this movie will definitely not work for you!"
"Date Movie is a horrible movie with a story that doesn't really go anywhere,although I will admit it makes a better effort than movies like Epic Movie and Disaster Movie,it's only that and that I like Alyson Hannigan are the only reasons I'm didn't give this one out of ten.Other than that,this movie is awful,one of my least favourite things about it is Jennifer Coolidge,an actress that really annoys me that plays an even more annoying version of Barbra Streisands character in Meet The Focker.Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) loses a tone of weight to look good for a man she plans to marry,but has to meet his weird parents and ex-wife,who still wants him."

"This is by far one of Adam Sandler's worst movies. I usually like him, but not in this. Sandler plays both Jack and Jill. Jill comes to visit for Thanksgiving and hangs out through the New Year. She is annoying, has a pet bird, and sweats a lot. Jack needs Al Pacino to star in a donut add and for some add reason, Al gets the hots for Jill. But, this is good for Jack, so he can get close to Al.The whole thing was just silly, I mean Al Pacino wanting to date Jill. And Jill is just so manly and has such a whiny voice. It was just silly and not funny. Katie Holmes has a lackluster role in this, why was she even there? FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time with this."

"'Seriously, I am not a politically correct, woke or outraged person.But the idea that a scumbag mafia guy, is going to sexually assault his way into a woman\'s heart is not just absurd, but simply disgusting.Think Christopher Moltisante\'s Cleaver script within Sopranos with no dramatic irony. My guess is this film was financed by mafioso types. Exactly what attributes does this mafia leader have? He has brutishness, but he has no cunning, no leadership skills, and is not credible as someone who would rise through the ranks in anything, including organized crime.\nHe is about as sexy as a toad.The acting, dialogue, plot and cinematography are just amazingly bad and cringe-worthy. The makers of this spent more time shilling the review section here than they did writing this junk.'"
"'. . . Japan\'s current Deplorable Trojan Horse from its official government Sony propaganda arm brags about casting our beloved STAR TREK and X-MEN icon, Sir Patrick Stewart, as Poop.

"CATWOMAN (2004) ** Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone, Lambert Wilson, Alex Borstein, Frances Conroy. Berry (barely) acquits herself as the notorious femme fatale comic book character in the latest big-screen adaptation of a cult character that relies on style over substance no thanks to some campy borderline dull moments conceived by first time helmsman Pitof (!) Not as bad as you'd think but not necessarily a new franchise with some questionable costume design (namely Berry's so tacky Frederick's of Hollywood discount dominatrix get-up that would have many Halloween parties a titter at) and a purloined screenplay (same plotline from the first 'BATMAN' where the Joker had digs on a poisonous cosmetics line; same deal here except with Eurotrash Lambert hamming it up and the deliciously over-the-top Stone as his nasty wife) that begs to question: couldn't they get Michelle Pfeiffer to reprise her role? A few fun moments that tiptoe into entertaining with its sleek production design and jazzy editing to shake the few plot holes up."
"'Wow, bad doesn\'t quantify. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation almost demands a whole new rating system.It\'s crazy that I know many of these actors from other things, which they\'re good in. Yet had no recollection of any of them being in this. Going from the greatest video-game adaption ever, to something close to a school production/SyFy channel film. I see this same director ruined another great sequel opportunity with The Butterfly Effect 2 also, DAMN YOU!'"
"'WOW!! I\'ve never seen so many negative reviews for a film which is, after all, simply a spin on a comic book hero that may not be dark enough to suit some and not witty enough to please others--but, please, it\'s not as bad as so many of you are claiming!After all, it\'s not as if the filmmakers took a classic piece of literature and took artistic liberties with it. It\'s just a comic book adventure that they\'ve given their own spin to--with results not as spectacular as the previous outings but not as bad as some would have you think. The special effects are awesome and the settings are visually stunning.George Clooney does a workmanlike job as Batman, perhaps more sullen than necessary, especially when dealing with his sidekick, Robin. The sets are spectacular, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a visually impressive Mr. Freeze (Germanic accent and all), and Clooney\'s scenes with Alfred are nicely underplayed. Moves at a brisk pace and, despite some annoying characterizations (including Thurman as Poison Ivy), it\'s an acceptable entry in the Batman series with both George Clooney and Chris O\'Connell looking fit in their contoured Batman costumes. Not exactly a work of art but certainly does not deserve the brickbats being tossed at it on this board.'"
"Toronto Maple Leafs star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) has fallen into a funk after his wife Prudence left him for L.A. Kings goalie Jacques 'Le Coq' GrandÃ© (Justin Timberlake). Team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) hires Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) for $2 million to fix Roanoke. Pitka wants to be the next Deepak Chopra. He doesn't get along with the diminutive coach Punch Cherkov (Verne Troyer).Mike Myers makes a mistake right from the start by putting this as a Toronto Maple Leafs story. On top of that, Guru Pitka is a bad SNL skit. If Myers had tried this on SNL, he would have realized its inherent problems and abandoned the idea. It is borderline racist and worst of all, it's not funny. The only funny bits happen with Troyer if I stretch to be kind. Alba and Malco are terribly bland. Guru Pitka could be a funny character if he's an innocent and naive to the modern world. He's not likable and the comedy is repetitive."

"Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) broke up with Jack. Relationships based on extreme circumstances rarely ever work. She's been dating a nice simple safe beach patrol cop Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) for the last 2 months. She runs into him taking a bad guy as a part of the SWAT team. He convinces her to go on a cruise to work out their relationship. John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is a disgruntle employee who uses his computer skills and inside knowledge to hijack the ship sending it into danger. He forces the passengers to abandon ship. Not everybody gets out as deaf girl Drew is trapped in the elevator. Alex decides to stay behind when he suspects foul play.It's really bad that Jack doesn't return. It's like a Die Hard movie without John McClane. Honestly, if they can't get Keanu Reeves back, I rather have Sandra Bullock save the day by herself. The movie never recovers from it. The first Speed is a manufactured plot but the writing is so good that it never felt fake. This is the exact opposite. Every move in the story feels fake. The first one pulls the audience right in. This one never does. The final boat crash has tons of destruction but it's played almost exclusively for laughs. It feels more like a spoof. It's fun as light weight action goes but I stop caring about the movie long before that."
"Sandra Bullock returns as Annie Porter, who, along with her fiancÃ©e officer Alex Shaw(Jason Patric) are on a romantic cruise liner which is (of course) hijacked by a deranged computer programmer(Willem Dafoe) out for revenge against his company, and wants to use the SeaBourn Legend as the instrument of revenge. Can Annie and Alex stop him? Unbelievably awful film is one of the most inferior sequels ever made. Idiotic plot, poor editing and direction(Jan De Bont) and a bizarrely different portrayal of Annie that is most unappealing(What went wrong between her and Jack Traven I wonder?) Jason Patric tries, but dreadful film is a sinking ship that he can't save.A total disaster."

"I'm going to say that I didn't understand whether the film was really a dream or a real one, but it's definitely a dream. Real people can only describe a human life in such a clichÃ© fiction using characters. Actors were awful in the movie, so I didn't expect acting. I watched the film without prejudice, but I became a cringe.\nThe film didn't have much comedy. It has been edited with fiction that has similar films everywhere and it has been really distant.\nIt would be better for everyone to tell the truth. The film has nowhere to be commended. Failed and clichÃ©."
'This film is very good\nHahahhahahah a joke'
'Do not let your kids watch this movie and any enes batur videos if you love your kids be aware'
"Street Fighter is a mockery of a film, that fails to entertain.I don't see what I possibly could of liked about it when I was young, must have been Chun-Li. Just because it's intended to be ridiculous, doesn't make it fun. Ken and Ryu are the absolute worst."
"'Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts.Who else (besides this film\'s director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game.This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps Mortal Kombat is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the Mario Bros movie... what was going on there?'"
"this movie is pretty bad.i haven't been this bored in a long time.Alec Baldwin must have been into the sauce when he agreed to do this thing.it's marketed as a kid's movie with a PG rating,but this really isn't a kid's movie.there is some very adult language implied.yet it is not a movie for adults either,because it is so juvenile.so,really this movie is not suitable for anyone.By the way,Mike Meyers looks like a complete idiot as the cat.this movie doesn't strike me as being very faithful to the spirit of the children's book by Dr.Seuss. the only other thing i can say about this movie is it is colourful.otherwise,there is no good reason for anyone to watch this movie.a weak 1/10"
"Hopelessly terrible stomach churner based on Dr. Seuss' (one of those unbelievably over-rated authors) famous children's book. Youngsters Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are visited in their alternatively sickening world by the titled character (the always annoying and unwanted Mike Myers) and total chaos ensues with little explanation and a bare minimum of narrative strategy. The kids' mother/real estate agent (Kelly Preston) is hardly around at all. Ditto for sleazy neighbor Alec Baldwin (What in the world is he doing in this picture?) as he has the hots for Preston, gives the cold shoulder to the children and loses his cool when he sees Myers. Film-maker Bo Welch is an art director by trade and the production is clearly obvious and in-your-face due to that fact as the sets are elaborately built and painted over with every oddball color you can imagine. Myers' makeup job can be looked upon as revolutionary, spooky or a total failure. Boredom and migraines are prevalent early on as not only will the adults in the audience suffer, but the kiddies will too. Turkey (0 stars out of 5)."
"'This film is about a boy who possesses a set of special skills that are thought to be lost, and he sets out on a mission to save the world.The Last Airbender has a lot of cool special effects involving fire and water, but other aspects are no good. The moves to bend the elements look forceless and unconvincing. The acting, even by the main characters, are uniformly bad. I am the most disappointed by Dev Patel, who was brilliant in Slumdog Millionaire. He shows no facial expression in this film, while the guy who played his brother is so much better than him in this aspect. The dialog can sometimes be strangely idiotic, as plot details are explicitly declared and repeated. Maybe it\'s a children\'s film, no plot detail is implied. Overall, The Last Airbender is alright for some brain off entertainment but I would not be looking forward to the sequel in excitement.'"
