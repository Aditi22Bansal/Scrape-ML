"'It is a sweet story with cute characters. The colour palette is full and summery, so children will love it.'"
"'Luca is Pixar\'s boldest attempt yet at an LGBTQ+ friendly film, though apparently it\'s still subtle enough (hard for me to believe) for the gay themes to go right over a viewer\'s head. My mom, for instance, didn\'t catch any of it at all.I had low expectations going in, but I found this movie to be very sweet and pretty delightful. Jacob Tremblay does terrific voice work as Luca, and the relationship between the two male characters at the story\'s center, whether you choose to read it as a coming out story or just a very close bond, is touching without being aggressively manipulative in that way Pixar movies can sometimes be.Plus, the pasta in this movie looks soooooo good that my family went on an Italian food binge for about a week after seeing it.Grade: A.'"
"'The savage team of a tug is ready to rest after the transportation of a platform. When they are celebrating in a bar, the plane pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) offers them the chance of rescuing a passenger vessel vanished in the oceans in 1962. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) and the rest of the crew, tempted by the possibility of a great reward, decides to risk one more rescue operation before going home. Their greed leads them, of course, to a ghost ship, where they are spooked and threatened by ghosts. One of them, a little girl, shows Epps what happened to the passengers and crew during the voyage in 1962. A horrible unraveled secret will haunt the rest of the crew. Ghost stories usually take place in a haunted house. This one is in a passenger ship. This movie is not in the same level of \'The Others\', \'The Shining\' or \'The Sixth Sense\', but is also good film. The screenplay play has some clichÃ©s and is predictable, but the cast, direction and special effects work well. Probably, the fans of romances will not like it, but those who like a ghost story will appreciate this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Navio Fantasma (Ghost Ship)Note: On 02 June 2017, I saw this film again.'"
"'This is a super (if rather freely) adapted version of the Alcott story about a family of sisters as they come of age towards the end of the American Civil War. I suppose that I do, personally, prefer the 1949 version - it has a little more feistiness. In this iteration though, Saoirse Ronan is great as the independently minded author determined to go through life on her own terms; no mean feat at the time. Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are good too as her sisters/mother respectively (though the accents are a wee bit dodgy on occasion). Meryl Streep has some cracking one-liners and has her facial expressions perfected. The star for me, however, is TimothÃ©e Chalamet - he plays the charming but emotionally fickle Laurie in a thoroughly captivating, engaging manner. The attention to detail is impressive and Alexandre Desplat\'s score helps the whole thing to come alive. It does sag in the middle; could perhaps do with shaving 15-20 minutes to tighten it up a little, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining watch.'"
"'The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table. It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads. Diabolically clever satire.Guide: F-word. No sex. Butt nudity at end of film.'"
"'This film tells the most severe case of haunting Ed and Lorraine Warren, two outstanding paranormal investigators, have ever seen.I am not a fan of horror movies, but The Conjuring truly blew me away. Everything from the plot, acting and the atmosphere of the film is superb. The story is believable, the family is likable and viewers are sympathetic of them stuck in a haunted house. The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, The Conjuring builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it. It is easily the scariest film I have ever seen.I was already impressed by Insidious, and The Conjuring makes me a fan of James Wan. When his next film comes out I will surely watch it.'"
"'Perhaps not as scary as The Exorcist, The Conjuring still has it\'s moments, relying on a slow build of tension and paranoia that manifests as demonic possession in the character of Carolyn Perron (Lilki Taylor) when the story really hits it\'s stride. The picture is based on the real life work of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, depicted in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. I didn\'t know this picture pre-dated 2014\'s Annabelle, so was taken aback a bit when an opening scene made use of that character. Ultimately, Annabelle\'s connection with the movie is not notable in and of itself, except as a centerpiece of the real life Warren\'s occult museum. There\'s a scene in the movie that\'s reminiscent of Hitchcock\'s The Birds which I thought was a little too obvious given the genre but it doesn\'t linger too long. The horror effects in the film are rather sensational, especially those that place members of the Perron family in harm\'s way by invisibly and violently thrashing them around; the upside down seated Lorraine on the ceiling was particularly chilling. When the main story is over, a reference is made that horror movie insiders will understand when Ed Warren makes note of an investigation he and his wife are about to undertake in Long Island. It\'s not mentioned by name, but fans will recognize it as The Amityville Horror.'"
"'a return. to the rules of classic horror. the comeback of tension and authenticity and role of acting as more than ingredient of screams. Conjuring has a solid story . and this is used in wise, subtle, credible manner. the fight against evil has new form and flesh. the ambiguity becomes more important than the shadows of blood. the tragedy of a family has not only impressive but so realistic than impose to the viewer a strange old emotion - to be part of the story. sure, Conjuring is not the only example of return to classic horror model from the last decade. but it is one of great films who reminds the basic purpose of cinema. to convince. to give force and substance and to convince the public. not a show. but a real good story. this does it a remarkable work.'"
'Awesome Korean movie. I like the bit where he cut his tongue off'
"Well maybe not so scary, more creepy from times to times. But only in a good way. This movie is yet another great fantasy tale from Tim Burton. And it seems, that he has special skills for fantasy tales. Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney? I don't know, could be, despite the fact he left Disney as young frustrated animator). But it's the story that will get you excited, it's very crazy and seems to be in the same vein as Edward Sciscorhands!"
"'The second animated feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993\'s THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot\'s perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I\'d say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn\'t lessen in any way the latter\'s remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.'"
"'it is admirable. because it represents a lovely remember of the small things who define the life. because it is a love story who has, in the perspective of Tim Burton, fascinating nuances. a simple story about an insignificant error, its consequences and the new arrangement of life. a pledge for kindness and the thin border between worlds. all in the skin of refined romanticism, gray, cold and seductive. the idea is not exactly new but this represents one of the basic virtues of the film. because, at the first sigh, all seems predictable. but the delicate art to use the expected sides of story is the most important thing. so, a simple story. and a lovely animation , for the songs, characters and humor. and, sure, for the story.'"
"'Tim Burton presents his dark, but comedic style in stop-motion animation. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS(1993) was a critical and theatrical success; and this black comedy is just as much fun to watch. The visuals are just outstanding; beauty comes in many forms. Victor(Johnny Depp)lives in a small 19th century European village, where the shy groom-to-be rehearses his wedding to Victoria(Emily Watson)and meets a beautiful, but deceased young corpse bride(Helena Bonham Carter),fresh from the grave; who actually is under the impression she has just married him.Other voices you may or may not recognize: Christopher Lee, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, Paul Whithouse, Jane Horrocks and Danny Elfman, who also provides the undeniably great soundtrack.'"
"Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police. He bought her a truck from Billy Black and befriends Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) but he goes to school in the reservation. She makes a few new friends but is more intrigue by the Cullens especially Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward can't seem to stand her at first. Then he saves her with his supernatural powers. There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson. They are good actors and it's not that bad as far as overwrought teen melodrama is concerned. They are teenage star-crossed lovers and there's no shame in that."
"'**REAL minor spoilers* Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) moves to Washington state to live with her father Charlie (Billy Burke)--her parents are divorced. While attending high school there she become attracted to light-skinned Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He is attracted to her also--but he turns out to be a vampire! I heard lots of negative things about this (that it didn\'t match the novel and looked cheap). While it\'s no masterpiece it\'s not that bad at all. It has a good score (especially when Bella discovers Edward is a vampire) and has beautiful locations. The sometimes clunky dialogue from the novel has been replaced (or written out completely) and the story moves very quick (the novel is over 500 pages). There\'s also excellent makeup and special effects used sparingly (which makes them all that more effective). Also the evil James is well played by Cam Gigandet and the final battle is actually pretty frightening. In terms of acting almost everyone is good--especially Pattinson who is just great. On the bad side--the movie seems somewhat muted (for some reason). Stewart is just OK (but she DID turn 18 while the movie was being filmed so that might have affected her acting). Also Burke is terrible as her father and it had a stupid it isn\'t over ending which wasn\'t in the book! Still, this was well-made and done and worth catching. I give it a 7.'"
"Based on Stephanie Meyer's enormously popular best selling sensation; a story of love at first stare. A sullen Bella Swan(Kristen Stewart)moves from Phoenix to a small wooded town in Washington state. Worlds and hearts collide when Bella meets a mysteriously handsome Edward Cullen(Robert Pattinson). He is putty paste white complete with eye-liner and lipstick. He is either a rock star, very effeminate...or a...vampire. Yes, he is of the undead persuasion and never sleeps. Bella is willing to give up everything to be with him forever...with limits that is. Edward and his family must protect and guard Bella from a totally different group of blood suckers.Interesting special effects. Beautiful Washington and Oregon scenery. Dialoge pretty lame; but the story line definitely sustains attention. Stewart is quite charming even being mostly emotionless. Others in the cast: Peter Facinelli, Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone and Cam Gigandet. I can't say it lives up to all the hype."
"'Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The wink wink humor of it, is not everybody\'s taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the shame of being green (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...'"
"I was in two minds about watching DEADPOOL. On the one hand, I generally enjoy modern-day superhero movies, which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through. They're easy viewing. On the other hand, I'm no fan of crude humour and bad language, and I knew what to expect with this one. I don't think much of Ryan Reynolds, either. I was pleased to find, then, that I enjoyed DEADPOOL quite a bit. It's not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy. As a comedy, it's also a lot wittier than I was expected, and I enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references. The crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didn't matter too much. The strong supporting cast features an on-form Ed Skrein and a typically hulking Gina Carano, but Colossus was my favourite 'star' here. The CGI-augmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge. To me, this feels like a natural successor to the CRANK films, albeit better made."
"It's eight months after the Blip, the moment when the people who got dusted in the Snap return after over five years. It's a period of readjustment as those people come to terms with the world five years later. Tony Stark is gone and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to fill some very large shoes. He and his friend Ned Leeds are set to go on an European school trip. Peter is struggling to make his move with MJ (Zendaya). In Venice, they are attacked by a water monster and they are saved by fish bowl head Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) who claims to be Quentin Beck from another Earth.It would have been great to have Gyllenhaal be Holland's replacement mentor. I don't mind the expected villain turn although he probably has a few too many henchmen. As for Zendaya's MJ, her deadpan delivery holds some interest but could be limiting in future sequels. The main question I have is whether this franchise needed an European Vacation already. Most of time, a franchise should be stale before trying to refresh itself with exotic locations. I wouldn't mind more high school and more Aunt May to let his world breathe. The reason for a younger Peter Parker actor is for him to live more fully in the high school experience. At this pace, he's getting a job at the newspaper in the next movie and that would be a shame. He should be having more high school soap opera before then."
"The Spiderman franchise seems to be the one that is bucking the trend with the films actually getting better each time. The dynamic between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal in this is great and now that we don't have to pretend we don't know Spidey's identity, we can develop the character much more fully so the relationship with MJ is also taking better shape too. It's fast-moving, entertaining and the plot is fun. For a change, the CGI is complementary to the production rather than the sole reason for it. Good stuff, this!!"
"It's the 1980's. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a privileged 27 year old Wall Street investment banker working for his father. He's a master of the universe type living in a pristine apartment. Jean (ChloÃ« Sevigny) is his suffering secretary. Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon) is his annoying fiancÃ©e. He's sure that she's having an affair with Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux) while he himself is having an affair with her best friend Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). On top of his materialistic vapid daily existence, he has bloodthirsty nights that gets more and more out of control.Director Mary Harron is doing a slightly surreal horror slash comedy. The major problem is that I don't really care about anybody or anything in this movie. There are some witty moments like the business card oneupmanship scene. However I just couldn't bother with the annoying boorish selfish character. At some point, the movie started to bore me. He's not funny and the movie isn't really that funny either. It's not scary as a horror. There is no tension since I don't about him or his victims. I just can't make myself care about this movie."
"'The film opens in London 1970 with Freddy working at Heathrow. In two hours it touches on the main aspects of his life, including his bisexuality and love for Mary (Lucy Boynton). The film concludes with the Live Aid concert where Rami Malek does a horrible lip sync. Rami Malek reminded me more of Mick Jagger than Freddie Mercury. In spite of my criticism, it would be difficult to find someone else more fitting for a difficult role who manages to break down the complexity. I was glued to the screen for the entire showing...singing along.Guide: 1 F-word. British swear words. No sex or nudity.'"
"Queen, arguably the best group of all time, get a movie which does that great band justice. Anyone that loves the band, Freddie, or just movie making at its finest, then this film is definitely for you. I'll admit I was sceptical, and am late going to see it, foolishly, because this was one of the best films I have seen in years, it's moving, it's funny, interesting, and as it showcases their best music, it's a musical feast also. People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and in particular the performance of Rami Malek, who is nothing short of sensational as the fabulous frontman, the supporting cast are sensational too, Gwilym Lee, who I know from Midsomer Murders was a revelation as Brian May. I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.Bravo. 10/10"
"'Surprisingly entertaining and informational biopic. Born in Zanzibar, Farrokh Bulsara came to England in his teens and in spite of a slightly odd appearance changed his professional name to Freddie Mercury (Rami Maleck). In 1970 the band Queen was formed and this flick follows the first 15 years of its roller coaster rise to stardom culminating with their historical Live Aid performance in 1985. A must see for even the most fickle of rock music fan. Malek turns in an excellent version of Mercury worth a Best Male Oscar Award.A powerful soundtrack and a cast that also features:: Gwilym Lee, Joseph Mazzello, Lucy Boynton, Adian Gillen, Aaron McCusker, Ace Bhatti, Mike Myers and Dermot Murphy as Bob Geldorf.'"
"'Sure, it could be better. and it deserves to be better. The music, the atmosphere, Freddie Mercury, the steps to succes and its meanings are good points. Nothing new, all familiar. Maybe too familiar and created with\ntoo many drops of fake. The best detail , sure, Rami Malek fine job. But he is a significant piece because the film has the virtue to give a show. That is the motif for see it. For the meet with the show. For a sort of time trip. It is a provocative film, presenting what you know. Or believe to know. But the manner to do that is\na good promise and Malek as Atlas gives a reasonable motif for see the film.t.'"
"AdÃ¨le (AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos) is in high school starting to date pretty boy Thomas (JÃ©rÃ©mie Laheurte). However Emma (LÃ©a Seydoux) with her blue hair catches her eye. She can't stop fantasizing about her and don't find Thomas satisfying. She is depressed and breaks up with Thomas. Her friend BÃ©atrice (Alma Jodorowsky) flirts with her. However the next day, BÃ©atrice rejects her. Then her gay friend Valentin (Sandor Funtek) brings her to a gay bar and later that night, she meets the older Emma. Her friends start berating her for being a lesbian.Taking the salaciousness aside, this is basically a coming of age movie. The confusion is palpable. AdÃ¨le gives a naturalistic performance. The pacing is quite slow. The movie spends time hanging out with these two characters. When it gets confrontational, the tension gets very high. It's a movie that breaks the audience down until they feel as raw as the character."
"'It looks like a cube genre movie. It\'s fun to watch movies like this. At the same time, you know how smart the screenwriter is. The movie was fun, I recommend it.'"
"It's been a few years. The gang decides to set up camp at the White House. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) is tired of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson)'s fatherly advices. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) proposes to Wichita (Emma Stone) which only drives her away. The sisters leave and Little Rock finds pacifist Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a boy at her own age. Columbus finds clueless Madison (Zoey Deutch) who had been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Little Rock runs off with Berkeley and Wichita goes in pursuit joined by the boys and Madison. Tallahassee encounters fellow Elvis fanatic Nevada (Rosario Dawson) and doppelganger Albuquerque (Luke Wilson). Columbus has his own doppelganger Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch).The original is irreverent fun. This one has the gang returning along with some very funny new side characters. This might have a few more laughs than the first one. I really like Madison and I wish she stayed with the group from start to finish. She's great at needling Wichita and the Uber bit is hilarious. The funniest bit has to be the introduction of Albuquerque and Flagstaff and I laughed hard. I would do some different things with the ending but I do like the Buffalo Jump. Overall, this is a great sequel which is just as much fun if not more than the original."
'We start out years later as our foursome make it the White House. Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone are together while Abigail Breslin wants a boyfriend. The zombies have evolved and the action moves to Graceland. The film has all of the regulars (Bill Murray in a flashback) and addition cast was great especially Zoey Deutch who stole all the scenes she was in as a near mindless individual.They make references to events in the first film as if you have seen it.Great mindless fun. I even caught the Steinbeck reference.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity'

"'Taylor Sheridan\'s Wind River is essentially two stories in one. The main plot is the murder investigated by Jeremy Renner\'s US Fish & Wildlife Service agent and Elizabeth Olsen\'s FBI agent. Since the murder has taken place on an Indian reservation - the Wind River Reservation referenced in the movie\'s title - the issue arises of whose responsibility it is to investigate. Renner and Olsen press forward with the investigation, and there\'s a lot to discover. The other plot is a focus on the status of people living on the reservation. The Indians are a minority in their own land, and are now relegated to dismal, isolated pieces of land with living conditions often comparable to the third world (not to mention high levels of alcoholism). Indeed, one of the movies addressed by the movie is the murders and disappearances of women on the reservations.I guess that my one complaint about the movie is Olsen\'s character. We get to learn about Renner\'s character\'s background, but not about hers. I would\'ve liked to hear more about why she chose the field that she did. Other than that, I found it to be a fine movie. I recommend it, and I\'m eager to see Sheridan\'s next movie.'"
"'A rookie FBI agent enlists a wildlife tracker to help solve a murder on a native American reservation.Writer/director Taylor Sheridan brings to life a tale which illustrates a forgotten class of people - missing native American women, the only group for whom no records are kept. Worse, any investigation into such cases is hobbled by jurisdictional uncertainties and wrangles. This underlies a story which is brutal and very emotional. JeremyvRenner and Elizabeth Olsen star, but everyone in it is quite excellent.I was grimly enterta8ned, but also appalled.'"
"A total blast to me and my sister! Beautiful cast, cinematography and great soundtrack. A lot more action than I was expecting but great fight sequences none the less. I'd say Kristen Stewart was the best thing about the movie, I like Naomi Scott too she's precious. I'm not sure whats going on with the ratings/reviews on this adaptation regardless I absolutely loved Charlies's Angels especially for it's women power and mindless fun!"
It's good to see a strong female role model in movies. They were punching and kicking with the best of them
"In what may be the worst marketing campaign of the year, and certainly close to the top 10 of the last decade, Charlie's Angels was likely never going to succeed the way Sony was hoping. Without a clearly beloved star across the board (Naomi Scott is a few years away from that) to center a campaign around, an unproven director, and an IP that had next to no buzz, what were they really expecting? The movie itself is perfectly okay. It's not a trainwreck but nor is it something worth seeing on the big screen. Maybe they would have been better off rebooting it with another TV series on a streaming service with a couple of big name actresses? A few cool action scenes and a neat post-credit montage helped, but it certainly doesn't save the doomed franchise. I would skip this one.4.8/10"
"'One of my all time favorites, School of Rock is the perfect mix of rocking, Jack Black humor, and a fun storyline. The premise is unique and well executed, the kids have great chemistry and Jack Black is at his purest.'"
"This is a film that has spawned a tv show and a musical, so it must have done something right.I watched this for the first time recently, having heard all the hype about it, and was pleasantly surprised.Yes, it follows the 'inspirational teacher film' structure, but puts something new on top of it, and features a good performance from Jack Black in the lead.Yes, it's unbelievable, yes, its ethics are questionable, but it's all good fun ultimately."
"'Jack Black is like Jim Carrey--he works so hard at his comedy that the strain at first overshadows the humour. But like Jim Carrey, he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can\'t help but be won over totally by his zaniness. I didn\'t think Black was very funny when this movie started, but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over. There seems to be a generation of film makers now (Richard Linklater, Cameron Crowe) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone cool, and their movies are full of welcome messages. Cool isn\'t about how you look or dress or act. Cool\'s a state of mind, man. Peace out.Grade: A-'"
"'Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven\'t seen What we do in the shadows, I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it\'s more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it\'s always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it\'s Phase 3 already if I\'m not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don\'t be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is'"

Director Waititi (who co-stars in motion capture CGI as an alien compadre) shrewdly turns the hero upside down and smartly relying on much needed humor and light-hearted endeavors layering the dark proceedings at hand. Laced with biting wit thanks to a well-tempered screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost allowing Hemsworth to stretch his comedic skills (deadpan lethal and with aplomb) while also allowing secondary (and new) characters to shine including Hiddleston as the arch half-brother Loki up to his usual antics and back stabbings (but less lethal this time) and a truly hilarious interplay ala Hope and Crosby with Ruffalo as an equally unruffled Banner trying to keep up with the plot. Enjoy!'"
"'The story line, I suppose fictitious, is a scientist claimed that humans are born with a blood alcohol level too low. (I suppose it is zero.) And that humans can perform much better with a small amount of alcohol constantly present in their systems, about 0.05%. (Of note many US states have legal limits of 0.08% so 0.05% is actually pretty high.)So four friends, all teachers at the local Denmark high school, decide to formally test the premise, in secret of course. Some of them see positive benefits, and especially in the vigor with which they teach the students. But things start to seriously go off the rails when they decide, if a little helps then maybe a lot will help even more. But they also find out being in a drunken stupor isn\'t the answer either. And the head of the school finds out and isn\'t pleased.Interesting movie, even in Danish with English subtitles. There are some humorous moments but it is a serious story, well worth a watch. At home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped, doesn\'t like subtitles.Interestingly I hear an American remake is in the works.'"
"'Captain Marvel is another entertaining superhero adventure. Maybe the most important is not the top-notch special effects but the humor and chemistry of the cute Brie Larson and the veteran Samuel L. Jackson. The screenplay could be improved with a better development of Carol Danvers and the alien war, but anyway it is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): CapitÃ£ Marvel (Captain Marvel)'"
"The story is captivating, and keeps me interested thoroughly. I didn't see the plot twists coming. There's a good mix of comedy, action and thrill. The visuals are excellent as well. The cat is really funny, and plays an integral role in the whole cinematic universe. I wouldn't have guessed it!"
"The films in this new monster universe haven't impressed me much at all thus far, but the action does seem to be consistently entertaining. With Godzilla vs Kong, it's no different. Do I care about a single moment of human characters during this film? Absolutely not. Is the action exceptionally good? 100%. And that's just how these films go unfortunately. Take that for what you will.6.5/10."
"'In Terrel, the veteran from Vietnam and retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) accidentally finds many trucks and a gang of drug dealers dead while hunting in the desert. Moss discovers also a wallet with two million dollars and decides to bring it home and not report his finding to the police. Meanwhile the owners of the money assign the psychopath killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to chase Moss following the transponder in the wallet and leaving a trail of murders. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), from the third generation of a family of men-of-law, investigates the crimes while questions the momentum of violence of his country.No Country for Old Men is a pretentious and overrated movie of Ethan and Joel Cohen. The authors blended the old story lines of Sam Raimi\'s A Simple Plan with Robert Harmon\'s The Hitcher plus some cheap philosophy to write this story. The result is not bad at all, with good performances and an unrecognizable Javier Bardem in the role of a psychopath killer. Unfortunately the story fails with its inconclusive conclusion. Surprisingly this average movie is ranked Top 250 # 79 in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Onde os Fracos NÃ£o Tem Vez (Where the Weaks do not Have Chance)'"
"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a reformed assassin but his beloved who reformed him has died. After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie."
"Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) wants to solve the 40 year old disappearance/murder of his 16 year old niece. He enlists the help of investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who thinks he is on to something. He needs an assistant and employs the talents of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) in the title role. Lisabeth is a savvy psychotic bisexual computer hacker/investigator who provides us with a dark bizarre subplot.During the investigation they uncover hints that point to a serial killer, who kills Jewish women based on quotes from Leviticus. The mystery isn't too hard to figure out with the numerous clues that they give you. The movie is best when Rooney Mara is on the screen.F-bomb, rape, sex, nudity (Rooney Mara)"
"After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale."
"The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace.Although I gotta admit that it was interesting looking at the cast and noticing that it includes Lin-Manuel Miranda as well as George Harrison's son Dhani."
"I know that many have waited for this. And I can tell you they were way more excited than I was. I have watched the Star Wars movies and I am not as big a fan as many of them are. I don't dislike the movies or the franchise. I just never was as big a fan as many were. One of the reasons is, I never had the experience as a kid. So while I totally get what some feel about them, and I respect that, I hope the same is attributed to me and my views.Having said all that, the movie is what one should and could expect. With some twists that may not make much sense, but get the thing to the intended ending everyone was ... well at list wishing for. Not exactly as it happens here of course, but still. You can't make everyone happy, that is just not possible. So this is either religion for you or just plain fun for a couple of hours. The director tried his best to please as many people as possible, which might not be necessarily a good thing ... but there you go"
"After flirting with Disney with his live action remake of Aladdin.Posh Guy Ritchie is back on the mean streets of London with this lock stock and two smoking barrel gangster tale.In The Gentleman, Raymond Smith (Charlie Hunnam) is the right hand man of Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey.) The king of the weed jungle.Mickey wants out and is in negotiation with a shark Matthew Berger (Jeremy Strong) to sell his business. However a Chinese gangster wants to muscle in on the deal and finds the location of one of Mickey's manor where the weed is grown.Raymond is told a story one evening by private investigator Fletcher (Hugh Grant) who has been hired by a tabloid editor to investigate Mickey.Ritchie must have thought that if Quentin Tarantino can go back to the same well, so can he. Ritchie even throws in a homage to The Long Good Friday but without a Pierce Brosnan cameo.It really is a simple story jumbled up with an unreliable narrator. Nothing in it is much of a surprise apart from the casual racism."
"'Actually the film unspools from a frame story where Fletcher blackmails from Raymond (Hunnam), Mickey\'s right-hand man for the kompromat he gleans and demands a lump sum of Â£20 million, and Ritchie makes a jolly attempt of injecting many a homoerotic banter and teaser between them, with Raymond putting on a poker face to countervail Fletcher\'s salacious innuendos, and it results in one of Grant\'s most unstrained, jocular performances, although eventually he cannot outfox his more relaxed opponent, as Hunnam absorbs all the jests with a tongue-in-cheek admittance, certain demographic is surely being mollycoddled.reading my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks'"

"Iris Simpkins (Kate Winslet) is a pushover for her ex (Rufus Sewell) and she's blindsided by his engagement. Amanda Woods (Cameron Diaz) is tired of her cheating boyfriend (Edward Burns) and leaves her LA life for a few weeks. They use a vacation website to chat up a home exchange. During their vacation, they each fall for their own local guys.It's a double rom-com. Jack Black is trying to be a romantic lead. He and Winslet make an odd couple. She's absolutely charming. He's not himself, and Eli Wallach is better as the lead. Jude Law is a more conventional choice for a leading man. He and Diaz work well together.It's an unabashed chick flick. It does exactly what you expect it to do. It just does it twice. It explains the running time of over 2 hours. It's kinda corny and kinda formulaic, but it has its heart in the right place."
"This installment picks up 8 years after the previous film. Harvey Dent is still praised as a hero while Batman (Christian Bale) has gone into hiding as a criminal. Our new criminal is Bane (Tom Hardy). He wears a breather mask that makes him look like Hannibal Lechter, but sound like Darth Vader. He is huge and strong plus he has those fancy gizmos and loyal men who work for him. He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil. She is perhaps the most complex character in the story. The film has an incredible amount of action with important plot points happening nearly all the time. You don't want to go out for popcorn during the feature, you will be lost when you return. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Blake, a police officer/detective who grew up in an orphanage...do you see it coming?PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
"The Little Things is enjoyable to watch, and that's mostly due to the acting skills from the whole crew. Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and most certainly an almost unrecognizable Jared Leto did a great job playing their characters. There's also a good amount of suspense which keeps your attention. That said the ending isn't really a satisfying ending. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks that. There was clearly something missing in the last part and that's a pity because The Little Things could have been much better. Now it's just a good movie worth watching, but it's not exceptional like it could have been."
"Straight forward and tense chiller; Lee Abbott (John Krasinski) and his wife Evelyn (Emily Blunt) and children are forced into a new way of life. The Abbott family will face the major struggle of going about life in silence in order to survive in a post apocalyptic world, where blind monstrous creatures use highly sensitive hearing to stalk out prey...human prey. Horror and tension will rapidly mount as the monsters are alarmed. By the way, one of the Abbott children was born deaf and Evelyn grows weary knowing she is expecting. How do you keep a new born baby quiet? Needlessly to say, this movie is rather silent. And you will jump from your seat a couple of times...and not for refreshments. The creatures don't really have a lot of screen time, but be assured they are scary looking. Krasinski not only stars, but directs and shares in the writing the screenplay. Ms. Blunt will gradually grab your concern. Millicent Simmonds, is an actual deaf actress that plays the non-hearing child; and is outstanding. A QUIET PLACE lives up to the hype!"
"'I liked the concept of A Quiet Place but unsure about the execution with much of the blame lying with the script. Ironic as the film has very few lines.Directed and co-written by John Krasinski. The setting is a desolate post apocalyptic world. Earth has been invaded by monsters who are blind but have ultra sensitive hearing. Make a sound and you are dead, ripped apart by an alien.Living in a remote farmhouse, a family does their best to survive but they have lost one child already. Lee (John Krasinski) and Evelyn (Emily Blunt) have set up their lives to survive this vicious world for their deaf daughter, Regan and young son Marcus. However Evelyn has become pregnant and is about to give birth to a baby and that baby is going to make noise.The film left me uneasy at the beginning as one young child walks single file at the back, with both the adults way ahead at the front. It did not look like sensible risk management to me and so it proved. This is a film that easily falls apart if you examine it carefully.However as a horror thriller, Krasinski makes it work to an extent. It is different and eerie with a lack of noise. The ending though is borrowed from Mars Attacks!'"
"'I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip, she doesn\'t care for scary movies.John Krasinski wrote, directed, and has a lead role here as Lee Abbott. His real life wife, Emily Blunt, is his wife Evelyn Abbott. They also have a deaf daughter and two young sons.As the movie opens we see shadowy figures quietly moving through what appears to be an abandoned store. Then we see that the whole town appears dead, but this family has a home and small farm outside town. On the screen flashes brief messages, like 89 days or 492 days, presumably since the alien monsters attacked and killed most people. These monsters are very fast and vicious, but they can\'t see, only detecting possible prey by hearing sounds. So everyone is very quiet, conversing mostly in sign language.Of course there wouldn\'t be much story if the people remained quiet and undetected, and if the monsters never were able to find them. So things do develop and as the movie ends it sets itself up for a possible sequel. The family does find the monster\'s Kryptonite, very high pitched sound.And in fact the IMDb has a listing for the sequel now in pre production. Suitably interesting movie.'"
"'Erstwhile Ghostbuster Bill Murray battles the dead again, only this time it\'s zombies.

"When Sir Ector thoughtlessly dies before competing in a money-making jousting tournament, his squire William takes his place and turns out to be quite good at it. Unfortunately, his lack of noble birth means that he is playing a dangerous game: fortunately, a chance encounter with down-on-his luck Geoffrey Chaucer brings him a penman who can provide well-forged credentials. Accompanied by fellow squires Roland and Wat, William (now known as Sir Ulric) embarks on a career and love life, while making friends and enemies along the way.The minute the audience at the joust start clapping along with We Will Rock You, it becomes clear that A Knight's Tale is minded to cheerfully disregard any suggestion that it should be historically accurate. Indeed, it goes out of its way to pepper itself with anachronistic gags, both verbal and visual.Heath Ledger, doing an excellent English accent, delights as William, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide excellent support as his two fellow squires. Rufus Sewell is a splendid villain, while Shannyn Sossamon is a little anaemic as the love interest. But towering above everything is Paul Bettany's hilarious Geoff Chaucer.This film is hugely entertaining."
"'if you looking for historical accuracy, for solid Medieval drama, for dramatic scenes and for old fashion historical movies, this is the worst choice. if you like an eccentric cocktail of modern music and Medieval pretext, easy story and Heath Lodger in a good role, this is a must see. because it is real seductive against it. predictable but nice. hilarious , unrealistic and chaotic. a sort of teenager game. but great in a way who has not exactly definition. because it is the sort of film for fun who could be reasonable kick to discover the truth about a period who, in this film, remains only a generous sketch.'"
"While there are some cheesy parts in the script and Shannyn Sossamon while beautiful with a magical smile not quite convincing as the fickle love interest, there is a lot to enjoy. There is constant wit and energy, and the soundtrack is marvellous. The opening scene with We Will Rock You brought the house down when I watched it with my family, and that scene was one of the more exhilarating moments in the film. The dialogue is modern, but there are some flashes of authenticity. One of two of them come across as cheesy but others work surprisingly well. There is a lot going on in the story, sometimes this can be a problem, with the length the film is at nearly two and a quarter hours, my feelings were mixed here. The side story about William's blind father was touching, but for my liking there were too many jousting matches. I will say the acting is very good, with Heath Ledger dashing, Rufus Sewell seedy as the Count and Paul Bettany stealing the show in a wonderfully comic turn as Geoffrey Chaucer. Overall, entertaining and fun, doesn't always work but I liked it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"'A few years before Heath Ledger starred in Brokeback Mountain, he played a man pretending to be a knight in A Knight\'s Tale, chock full of deliberate anachronisms (namely the soundtrack). I swear that it was one of the funniest movies that year. I just gotta wonder: who comes up with these things? This movie is also interesting for an early appearance of Paul Bettany, who went on to play Russell Crowe\'s friends in A Beautiful Mind and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, and married Jennifer Connelly. All in all, this is one cool movie. It would be hard to imagine anyone not liking it. Hilarious. So I bid ye all to watch this film...\'twill not make ye bored one bit.'"
"I don't usually watch horror films. I have maybe seen three or four. I'm not talking about old Dracula or Frankenstein movies, but the current stuff. This film was so good that even a non fan like myself would enjoy it.The film was tense and action packed throughout. If you like blood, this film had it, but it wasn't gross. If you like tight suspense, then this is the film for you. It changed every second and you never knew where it would end. I'm still not sure about the ending, but I am not hopeful for the four who were left.Ving Rhames was excellent. He was supported by a great cast and each character added something of value to the film."
"'If you can get your head around the fact, that this is called Dawn of the Dead but is more an action movie, rather than a horror movie. Hence do not compare this with the original (Romero) Dawn! It works pretty good as an action movie. Zombies that can run, may or may not be your thing (I\'m still with the slow ones). Social criticism has gone (almost completely) AWOL, but it is still nice to see at least one familiar face (Ken Foree that is).I really dug this movie although I am really big fan of the Original. But as I have said before, you can\'t compare the movies. And even though I haven\'t seen the Day of the Dead remake (haven\'t heard nothing good about it at all), I\'m pretty sure this is one of the better remakes of Romero movie (even or because it does not try to imitate it).'"
"If you are looking for flashy, loud and generally speaking fast paced action Science Fiction: This is not the one you are looking for (no pun intended). But if you like slow, lingering and long shots, a movie that takes time to breathe and gives an epic scale to it's framing and cinematography, you could do a lot worse.I'm being a bit modest concerning the movie of course, because we're talking about a very well written script, that has a few surprises along the way and warrants more than one viewing and things to discover on those repeat viewings. It is really well acted and it has a story that is gripping as well as interesting from start to finish. The title alone suggests something, even if you haven't seen the trailer (which I didn't) - so you are in a way more prepared than our characters. But at the same time on their level ... So many Questions and not all get answered (at least not while watching it for the first time)"
"'Once again, Marvel have succeeded in reinventing this franchise - and again, they have alighted on a Brit. Tom Holland is a super choice as our hero - he has oodles of on-screen charisma; he genuinely looks like he can\'t believe he is there half the time, and that all helps to make for an enjoyable fantasy adventure film. This time, he has to learn to master his spidey-senses (with a bit of help from Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.) and the very rarely Happy Hogan (John Favreau)) before Michael Keaton - equipped with wings and a seriously powerful ray gun destroys all in his path. The performances are top drawer; the script is quickly paced with plenty of action, determination, humour and the slightest hint of menace, and the cleverly designed effects blend seamlessly into the action creating a thoroughly entertaining film. It is a bit too long, to be honest - but the casting is good, the direction tight and the whole thing a good family watch with a little bit for everyone.'"
"Salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) holds a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) after his takeover of the Battle of New York cleanup. Toomes kept some of the Chitauri tech to create new weapons. Eight years later after the events of Civil War, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns to his school, Midtown School of Science and Technology. He lives with his sought-after aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He has a crush on classmate Liz. His best friend Ned discovers his secret identity Spider-Man. There is also the sarcastic academic teammate Michelle (Zendaya).This is fun. It's got the comic book action. It weaves into the MCU with ease. RDJ has a supporting role which is more than a simple cameo. This definitely has the John Hughes vibe. It's nice light fun in this overarching comics universe. Holland is a great teen Spider-man as he showed in Civil War. The young cast is terrific and Keaton is an awesome villain. Keaton has real depth which is built over the years. His humanity creates more than a comic book villain. The surprise connection hits it out of the park. This is simply a good movie."
"'This is the sequel to the Avenger film which briefly introduced a geeky Spider-Man and not a sequel to the one where they killed off Emma Stone. I apologize if you haven\'t seen that one yet. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is now in NYC and is crushing on Liz (Laura Harrier) who is crushing on Spider-Man...like the Lois Lane thing, but add in High School and teen angst. Spider-Man has a contact man for the Avengers, ironically named Happy (Jon Favreau). Through a mishap, his identity is discovered by a geek friend (Jacob Batalon) who becomes his chair man. Spider-Man is not yet part of the Avengers as of this time and is still semi-separate from them. The film gives him a powerful enemy (Michael Keaton) but not too powerful, i.e. someone within Spider-man\'s wheelhouse.The ending was slightly unexpected and we find out that Gwyneth Paltrow is not dead. Stan Lee cameo near the beginning.Guide: No sex or nudity. Frequent use of the word penis as in \'Penis Parker. A cut WTF at the end.'"

"Internship is funny and it might work better or worse for you depending if you like the main actors or not. It has some very funny scenes and even the construction itself does work, even though you do know where it all is going to (predictable would be the word you're looking for in that case).Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have a great chemistry, they do exactly what you'd expect them to do (actually Vince hasn't surprised anyone in years, either amused or annoyed the viewers). Some of the supporting cast is really nice though. We have one guy who is a regular at the Today Show (with Jon Stewart), who has only a few scenes, but is funny as hell (as expected, too), but the rest of the bunch does have their fair share of moment to shine too. If you can sit through the obvious, you'll have fun"
"'The Internship' is Good Fun! An entertaining, feel-good film, that doesn't tax your brain. Its a smooth watch!'The Internship' Synopsis: Two salesmen whose careers have been torpedoed by the digital age find their way into a coveted internship at Google, where they must compete with a group of young, tech-savvy geniuses for a shot at employment.'The Internship' has a few clichÃ©d moments, but other-wise, this recent comedy, doesn't have any massive flaw going against it. Its interesting to see its aging protagonists having fun & emerging victorious against the youngsters. The characters work & so does the narrative.Vince Vaughn & Jared Stern's Screenplay surrenders to clichÃ©s at times, but is well-done otherwise. Shawn Levy's Direction is appropriate. Cinematography & Editing, are average. Performance-Wise: Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson are very good. Also, they share a wonderful chemistry on-screen, just like they did years back in Wedding Crashers. Max Minghella is convincing in a menacing part. Rose Byrne looks gorgeous & delivers a restrained performance. Aasif Mandvi is impressive. John Goodman & Will Ferrell are terrific in cameos. On the whole, 'The Internship' works."
"'Well, I was pretty harsh in my reviews of Leon:The Professional and La Femme Nikita for different reasons, both by director Luc Besson. I find myself pretty much in the same position here. Not that this isn\'t a slick and stylish espionage thriller, but the action sequences defy all manner of credibility, making even John Wick a piker relative to body count when all the dust settles. I guess that\'s what one expects when going into a flick like this, but after a while it gets almost comical. The chronologically challenged time frames also don\'t help, and I can\'t say they were totally necessary to tell an effective story. What they provide are the unexpected twists involved in turning an assassin into a double agent, and then a triple agent, and I guess you could have gone on and on in that manner if the picture wanted to. There\'s also that slick use of a body double to mimic Anna (Sasha Luss) in some of the tighter spots she found herself in. With lowered expectations, this might fill the bill for action fans, but leave your thinking cap in the closet.'"
"In 1985 Moscow, CIA agent Lenny Miller (Cillian Murphy) loses nine operatives to KGB chief Vassiliev. Years later, Anna (Sasha Luss) is struggling in life and signs up for the Russian Navy. KGB agent Alex Tchenkov (Luke Evans) recruits her to be an assassin under the supervision of Olga (Helen Mirren).It's another hot assassin movie from Luc Besson. La femme Nikita is almost 30 years ago. He's like an old painter who keeps returning to the same style over and over again. He's trying something a little grittier and a little more real. It's not his lane. His lane is hot girl doing wild actions with simplistic story. He tries to add layers to the story. At last, he's no Graham Greene which brings to mind the acting skills of model-turned-actor Sasha Luss. She tries and the character is essentially her without the killings. She's surprisingly functional but she's no Meryl Streep. Finally, I would try to clean up the constant time-jumps in the plot. They are supposed to be shocking reveals but they mostly confuse and are unnecessary. If he does a straight forward timeline, the movie may actually gain some tension of wondering if anybody can be trusted. He's probably not capable of doing the truly gritty espionage movie. Somebody should do a film retrospective of his hot female assassin movies."
"1980's Lombardia, in a summer in which there is no rain, where everything is just high philosophy, swimming in lakes and reading in the sun on an Italian mansion, two people fall in love. The acting is good, the script is subtle, the love story is expressed very well, the scenery is amazing. It's just that there is no story other than the romance. Everything is perfect, including the ending. A perfect summer romance with no ups or downs, no extra context, just love. My wife loved the film, I was trying very hard not to fall asleep.Bottom line: You probably have to be in the mood to enjoy the film. I didn't think the gay angle was significant in any way. Had it been between a man and a woman, I would have felt similarly bored."
The film is set in Northern Italy in 1983 before the AIDS crisis. The film is about a teenager named Elio Perlman who comes of age one summer. Oliver is his father's research assistant sent for a summer internship. Their romance slowly begins and unfolds during the film. Elio's parents must be the most enlightened parents ever. They even hint that they know about their son's sexuality before he tells them. They even send him and Oliver on a road trip together towards the end of the film. The romance is believable. The actors do their best to convey their attraction although somewhat discrete in Italy. Elio lives with his parents at a villa in Northern Italy year round. The summer flies by though as does the film. The film does have an abrupt ending about Oliver and Elio's relationship.
"CALL ME BY YOUR NAME (2017) **** Armie Hammer, Timothee Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Esther Garrel, Victoire Du Bois, Vanda Capriolo. Wonderful coming of age romantic dramedy set in Northern Italy circa 1983 with teen Chalamet (a superb performance) bonding with and eventually falling for Hammer (equally good), his father's research assistant. Based on Andre Aciman's novel, James Ivory's adaptation is wistful, very funny and deeply poignant in the depiction of losing one's virginity, learning who they are and accepting the challenges ahead. One of the year's best with lovely cinematography by Syaombhu Mukdeprom, Simon and Garfunkelian songs by Sufjan Stevens and beguiling direction by Luca Guadagnino."
"This film tells the story of a 17 year old man in a small town in Italy, who is the son of an archeologist. One day, an American research assistant arrives to assist with research, and the young man's life is not the same again.It is refreshing to see that a coming of age film that is not overly dramatic. In this film, all characters appear very real, and they connect with each other and with the viewers. I like the fact that the story is delivered in a understated, or even muted manner. The pacing is slow, which gives time for feelings to develop and sink in with the viewers. The final scene is just super effective, it makes me hold my breath to listen intently on what the father has to say. The message is not just applicable to the characters in the film, but to every human being on Earth. It is a profound message about the heart and the body. This film is such a beauty."
"'This film tells the story of a African American man who travels to see his Caucasian girlfriend\'s parents in their house in the countryside. Though they seem to profusely welcome him, there is something not right about the whole setup. Soon his hunch turns into a deadly reality.Get Out has a rather slow pacing to start with, as the story develops and the stage is set. The racial topic is brought up a little to often to be comfortable, but soon the reason for these strange encounters become apparent. The story is thrilling, and there is quite a bit of mystery in the film. The ending is unnerving and unexpected. The audience were very engaged with the film; gasps and applause were quite frequent towards the ending climax. It is an enjoyable thriller.'"
"'Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie. Great action, great acting, and some good ole arse kicking. A superhero for the modern age, black panther gives us all the vibes. The ladies keep it real, redefining what it means to be a supporting role, and taking up arms in killer action scenes. I also quite enjoy a bad guy who is relatable and toes that line. Michael B. Jordan really shines as kilmonger, he makes the movie.'"

But I think the real reason\nthese films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many\nheroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical\nsuccessor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged.\nSomething like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats\none challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit.\nBoseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea,\nbut it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they\nare, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."
"'Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a non-popular nerd in his high-school, having just two friends, Eli (Chris Marquette) and Klitz (Paul Dano), and concerned with the situation of a Cambojean student and in getting a scholarship to Georgetown. When the sexy Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) comes to live in the next door, they date and fall in love for each other. Later, Matthew finds that Danielle was a porn star, but when her former boyfriend and producer Kelly (Timothy Olyphant) visits her and invites her to return to the porn industry, the situation gets out of hand of Matthews and he gets into serious trouble.The Girl Next Door is a very sexy and funny comedy, and the confusions that Matthew gets into are hilarious. There are many elements of Risky Business in this movie, and the greatest modification is that Danielle is not a prostitute like Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), and I believe the writer got inspiration in that 1983 comedy to write this story. Elisha Cuthbert is extremely sexy and perfect for the role of Danielle, and Emile Hirsch fits very well for his character. However, Timothy Olyphant steals all the scenes as Kelly. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Show de Vizinha (Show of Neighbor)'"

"If like me, you're a fan of suspense, and love a movie packed with tension, then this one will tick a lot of boxes for you. It's very dark, at times a little grim, and I guess on occasion you'll need to suspend belief, but it's gripping, very cleverly crafted, edge of the seat viewing. The film felt very different to other horror/thrillers I've seen recently, there was a fair bit of originality to it.The first half of the film was somewhat moderate, built up tension, some moments where you watch and literally can't breathe. The second half of the film trebles the tension, at times the tension is almost unbearable, it was expertly done.The turkey baster scene had everyone squealing at the cinema, and like my title suggests, it'll be a long time before I want Turkey dinner again!!A mighty fine watch, 8/10"
"DON'T BREATHE (2016) ***1/2 Stephen Lang, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Emma Bercovici, Franciska Torocsik, Christian Zagia, Katia Bokor, Jane May Graves. Unnerving thriller about a trio of friends whose home invasion/robbing spree comes to a halt when they pick on the wrong dupe, a blind Gulf War veteran grieving for the recent loss of his daughter (Lang pitch perfect and creepy as hell) who proves to be a lethal force to be reckoned with. Suspenseful and taut as a trip-wire filmmaker Fred Alvarez - who co-scripted the equally nerve-jangling script by partner-in-crime Rodo Sayagues - pulls out all the stops employing a deftly edited sound effects score by Joshua Adeniji and gooseflesh cinematography by Pedro Luque. Levy and Minnette shine as the closer two of the three criminals by balancing the tricky beam of begin innocent and guilty in their actions. Hang on."
"'Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than R especially when the siblings are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his sister and mother! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston provide plenty of laughs as the parental units along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer! The whole movie was both raunchy and a little heartwarming with likable characters throughout. And, yes, it was funny enough for me and my friend. So on that note, I recommend We\'re the Millers.'"
"'When a small time pot dealer, David Clark(Jason Sudeikis) is robbed, he is hard pressed to find a way to pay back his supplier. To save his own skin and get back in the good graces of his boss, David agrees to travel to Mexico and smuggle a major stash across the border. He rents an RV and gathers a fake family to use as his cover. His neighbor Rose(Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who just quit her job, is willing to pretend to be his wife...for a fee of course. Rounding out his new family will be Kenny(Will Poulter), a shy professed virgin and Casey(Emma Roberts), a street wise runaway. Now the family known as the Millers, on vacation, should make smuggling drugs a bit easier. Well guess again; the dealers in Mexico feel they have given a huge amount of drugs to the wrong person and are in hot pursuit. Along the way, the Millers will meet another RV of vacationers...a DEA agent and his family.Funny situations, pervasive language, drug content, crude sexual scenes with very brief nudity. Of course, my favorite sequence is when Rose must prove to drug dealers that she actually is a stripper. Well done, I must say. And young Mr. Poulter may just be accused of being the scene stealer. He is funny! The cast also includes: Nick Offerman, Tomer Sisley, Molly C. Quinn, Kathryn Hahn and Ed Helms.'"
"'I don\'t know if you\'d call Wes Anderson an acquired taste or not; I didn\'t like \'The Life Aquatic\' very much and felt the subject matter for Moonrise Kingdom is part of the reason the culture is hitting bottom of the barrel levels these days. Yet this film held a strange fascination for me that\'s tough to put a finger on. I enjoy movies with rapid fire dialog, and crusty language doesn\'t bother me, so those features of the picture delivered quite well. There was also the stylized CGI used in the scenes of the hotel itself and that very odd funicular railway construct that seemed just the right sort of bizarre for my taste. I managed to recognize virtually all the cameo players except for Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel, the rest were on either side of hilarious. Willem Dafoe\'s Jopling character was particularly over the top and made for an intriguing assassin. The story itself was rather interesting, a sort of offbeat heist and murder mystery, but with elements that defy classification. I guess with Anderson\'s films you have to take them one by one. This one I could take a couple more times.'"

"'It\'s so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: The Great Race and It\'s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. What transpires is Ralph Fiennes\' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth. One reviewer talked about it not making any money. If that\'s the case it means that a whole bunch of viewers have passed up a gem.'"
"'Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and EmilyÂ´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?The Invisible Man is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): O Homem InvisÃ\xadvel (The Invisible Man)'"
"THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) *** Elizabeth Moss, Oliver Jackson-Cohen, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Michael Dorman. Filmmaker Leigh Whannell's unique re-imagining of the classic horror film updates it with Moss as a victimized woman whose attempt to leave her abusive relationship with wealthy optics genius Jackson-Cohen results in his suicide but eventually it's known to her that, instead, he has developed a method of becoming invisible to stalk her. Moments of true tension are cunningly employed thanks to the clever cinematography of Stefan Duscio and Benjamin Wallfisch's taut score but it is truly Moss' stellar turn as Cecilia Kass who manages to walk the tightrope of sanity while proving her sustainable urgency in bettering herself."
"To say I didn't get what I was expecting is a huge understatement, I was expecting a run of the mill horror, with all the usual cliches, obvious and blatant scares, etc, but instead I got to watch ninety minutes of rather subtle, intelligent and subtle horror. The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what's coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it's not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.Very watchable."

"'The King is a historical war drama movie directed by David Michod and stars Timothee Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, Robert Pattinson, Lily-Rose Depp and Sean Harris.Wow what a surprisingly great movie to watch. The movie is captivating and intense which is backed by strong acting and a great climax, some might complaint about the speed or the length of the movie but it can be ignored.For a movie to become a great movie there are some ingredients are required such as good plot, execution, acting and a fitting climax and this movie clears all the perimeter to become a good movie.The direction of the movie is good and the screenplay is slow yet engaging. Acting is one of the strongest aspect of the movie and Chalamet and Pattinson were superb. Cinematography is stunningly beautiful and the climax of the movie is strong. The movie should be known as the movie as one of the greatest war movies which is superbly supported by strong acting, great acting and superb execution. A must watch for all historical war movie lovers.'"
"'The film is a dark comedy and a generic spoof of family ritualistic satanic films. It opens with a wedding to Beethoven\'s 9th symphony D minor etc played during Clockwork Orange while Alex DeLong was being tortured by his own love for the music. Grace, a commoner (Samara Weaving) is going to wed Alex Le Domas whose family has more money than God. They made their money from the manufacturing of games. At Midnight, they must play a game drawn from a card taken from an old box that they play or die. Grace was hoping for checkers.The title hints at the game and film poster of an armed bride who is dirty, tattered, and torn tells you what happens. The film had a number of light moments with an ending that made me laugh. Melanie Scrofano plays Emilie who loves her cocaine and can\'t shoot straight. Some of the players are apathetic about the game but play because they are told they must or die. The family consisted of a cast of characters that made the film fun.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
"I will give it to ready or not, it does not let up! The whole movie is just utter insanity from the beginning to the last second. You think you're ready, but you're not, it's wild. Weaving does a great job as the main character, she's put through her paces and just keeps moving (and looks pretty badass doing it!). I really enjoyed the quirky nature of the dialogue and acting. You're laughing one minute, then gasping the next. They make no bones about the premise and each character plays their part beautifully. The ending is a bit weird, but in context it couldn't have ended any better. Really something."
"Or is it? Right from the start we do realize there is more to it than just a simple game. So with that overshadowing the next section of the movie (viewer being ahead of our main character/heroine), it is up to the actors and the dialog/script to keep us on our toes and make this entertaining nonetheless.And the movie succeeds in doing so. I guess it could have been even better in some respects, but overall this is really good. The characters make sense (in their own universe) and the story is coherent enough (even if you may disagree with that statement during the end - I think the joke works quite well ... but that's me). Not for the faint hearted for sure ..."
"You'll never be mean? I actually have no idea, but if you find something to rhyme this with, be my guest and use it! While I'm not sure about the 3-D in the movie, I do know that I liked the movie overall. Despite its flaws and faults. The female lead seems to have too little to do and the family subplot seems almost irrelevant. But you never know (unless it's in the comics, which I only read a few when I was a kid), if some of those things might get interesting in the inevitable sequel.The effects are pretty good and our main guy is likable. There is the funny/goofy friend and other things (like our hero's arch) and the actors obviously have fun with it all. Captain America was way better though and might have gotten bad reviews because people were starting to get fed up with comic book movies (which might be partly Green Lanterns fault).One other thing: After the credits start to roll, stay put. A couple of minutes into the credits there is a tag scene ... that's all I'm going to say ... well that and the fact that after that, when the credits start to roll again, this movie is over."
"'After witnessing the death of his father in an aircraft accident Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) grows up trying to be as fearless as he presumes his father was. This leads him to test his limits and accept risks that most normal people would not attempt. Then one day an alien from another galaxy crashes his spaceship and upon realizing that he his death is imminent allows the essence within a powerful ring in his possession to seek out a worthy recipient who has the courage to face his fears. Needless to say, the essence immediately finds Hal and brings him to the alien who proceeds to give him the ring and some final last words before dying. And so begins the life and adventure of another member of the Green Lantern Corps. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been an excellent superhero film if it had a more serious or coherent plot. Unfortunately, the director Martin Campbell apparently couldn\'t focus on what kind of movie he wanted and the result was one which had some rather bad CGI along with some heroes and villains who belonged more to a children\'s matinÃ©e than a prime-time movie. In other words, it lacked the necessary intensity. Yet despite some of the negatives, it wasn\'t necessarily a total disaster as it still remained fairly interesting and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.'"
'This is one of my favourite movies about something green'
"The Hangover is about a group of 4 guys going to Las Vegas for a bachelor party just two days before the wedding.Though bachelor party films are so overdone, The Hangover puts a fresh spin on the whole concept. The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night. It's so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it's out of the world. Basically the film is unbelievably funny, you have to see it to believe it."
"I was really reluctant in seeing this movie, but am glad I viewed it. It is rib-cracking funny. Doug(Justin Bartha) is getting married in two days, so his best friends Phil(Bradley Cooper)and dentist Stu(Ed Helms) decide to throw a bachelor party of shots, strippers and debauchery in Las Vegas. There's a problem before the trip even begins, Doug's future brother-in-law Alan(Zach Gallfanekis)decides he's going to tag along. And Alan is wired on the freakish side. The party boys wake up in their Caesar's Palace villa with a hell-of-a hangover. Not only are their heads addled, but something is amiss. Stu has a tooth missing. There is a tiger in the bathroom and a newborn baby in the closet. Oh yes, Doug is missing.There is no recollection of what happened before they passed out. If they can piece things together, they may be able to find the groom.Hilarious naughty sequences. Revelation of the night's events are outrageous, if not interesting. Finding their missing pal is an adventure in itself. And I found the wedding singer and his lyrics very inappropriate and knee-slapping funny. You may need to watch a second time to glean all of the off-color humor. I found Helms to be a down-right hoot. Also in the cast: Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, Mike Tyson, Jeffrey Tambor and Sasha Barrese."
"What We Do In The Shadows, a horror 'mockumentary' that follows a group of vampire flatmates in New Zealand as they go about their night-to-night activities, both ghoulish and mundane, does for vampires what Spinal Tap did for Heavy Metal bands: it puts its eccentric characters at the centre of some extremely outrÃ© situations, yet still shows them as real people that the viewer can identify with and care about. As with Rob Reiner's celebrated 'rockumentary', the wonderfully realised collection of likable characters, the delightfully droll sense of humour and plenty of highly quotable dialogue ensure that the film is destined for cult status.The cast are uniformly excellent, their deadpan delivery of some very silly dialogue making for some seriously funny moments (although my favourite character, Petyr, an 8000-year-old Nosferatu-style vampire, managed to make me laugh without uttering a word, his confused expressions enough to tickle my funny-bone). Writer/directors Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi keep the pace brisk enough and the action varied enough to make certain that their central joke never wears thin, the silliness including a female familiar who is fed up with cleaning up blood and providing virgins, a newbie vampire who brags about his newfound status, a human who is welcomed into the group, a pack of irascible werewolves, and an annual masquerade party where the vamps get to let off some steam."
"Visually, Raya and the Last Dragon is a treat. The animation of this movie is engaging, and the colors & textures are enthralling. The plot isn't anything new, though. It's derivative of many stories we've seen before, so it's fairly predictable. However, this film will keep kids entertained and it won't annoy adults. It's not the best Disney has to offer, but it's still pretty good."
"'If you like the movie Tucker you might like this one. Then again you might not, as this movie is actually nothing like Tucker. I guess it would depend on your taste in movies.'"
"An extremely complex structure/movie, that might be too much for some people. Too much information, a too confusing plot line, not enough action, too slow a pace. All things that could be said about this movie. But it's still gripping. Even if you don't get what it means, after watching it the first time (I didn't), it still is a mesmerizing experience.In a time-line that doesn't seem clear, in a world that looks like ours, but feels entirely different, this movie gets its strength from the plot, which as well can be it's weak point for many. If you're not appalled to the strange, feel free to experience this movie ..."
"'Definitely it defied the totem of starcast to hit a movie; go and watch Bhuj and you would cry out your heart for its that pathetic. On the other hand, this movie had almost all the elements of a war/drama movie: environment builtup, cinematography, vfx, war scenes, a benign love story, good acting skills, and of course, screenplay. Amazing.'"
"A coming-of-age story like no other, Julia Ducournau's feature film debut is an exquisitely crafted, elegantly narrated & excellently performed horror thriller that's beautiful yet brutal, erotic yet disturbing & shocking yet compelling, and makes for a thoroughly gripping meditation on carnal cravings of all kinds."

"'Possibly the weakest of the series, this one, for me. Our trio start by visiting the Quidditch World Cup which is invaded by the evil Death Eaters who reduce everything to ashes in their search for Harry. Shortly afterwards, the Tri-Wizard Cup comes to Hogwarts - a good excuse to introduce some new characters amongst them Frances de la Tour as the enormous Madame Maxime and Roger Lloyd-Pack as Barty Crouch as each school chooses their champion to take part in the potentially lethal games. Hogwarts chooses Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) but the goblet also chooses our Harry and so four go into the competition. As this description, so far, probably indicates - there is an hell of a lot going on here and not surprisingly the adaptation to the screenplay starts to leave out detail and characterisation. To do the story justice, it ought to have been two films - we spend way too long establishing and when we get to the climax, it all seems a bit too rushed. Mike Newell simply has to squeeze too many, important, interweaving themes into 2Â½ hours and it doesn\'t quite work. It is still a great fantasy adventure building well on the now well-established characters and putting more meat on the bones of the Harry Potter character.'"

"This movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.If there is any problem, it's that the ideas behind horcroxes are somewhat confusing. They never really explained it easily or clearly. It's a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job. The most important part is the exciting battles. It's a thrilling end and a satisfying one for fans of the series."
"'After the movie had played for the last time in a cinema, you could hear the cinema owners moan. The Harry Potter movies were a cash cow. Not only for the studio that produced them, but also for anyone who played them in their cinema (chain). Now it\'s over and everyone is thinking: What\'s next? While that may sound like something that may not be of interest to you, think of that: When you watch Daniel Radcliffe, do you immediately think of Harry Potter? What about the other young actors in this? It might be difficult for them to find themselves. While they all tried other things, even during the Potter years, they became the faces of this movie franchise.Getting back to the movie. The special effects are up to date (something you should expect), the story concludes nicely (for someone who hasn\'t read the books, including myself). The acting is solid throughout. There is one scene though, that was really bad. And it involves Daniel R. and a train station. Unfortunately he can\'t convey the emotions he is going through in this pivotal scene. Other than that, you will watch it if you have seen the other movies and won\'t be disappointed'"
"'This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don\'t like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God\'s sake. This is full of spectacle, humanity, and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I\'m surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren\'t complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren\'t as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.'"
"What I don't understand is the low rating for this amazing flick. Or maybe I do understand because the two females in it aren't wellknown for acting in gory flicks and here they do.It's funny in some moments, it's over the top gory and some situations you think, okay byt the result isn't what you expect, in other words, I can't go really deep into this because I would spoil a lot.Nevertheless, if you are a gorehound do pick this up. If you thnk you are going to see a romantic flick forget it. It's a pure no-brainer, one you see with your friends. Entertainment on a horror/comedy level. Sometimes Tucker And Dale (2010) comes to my mind for the gore attached not for the comedy. You get it, not a normal flick but did I love it.Gore 3,5/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 4/5\nStory 4/5\nComedy 2/5"
"Lara Croft has been rebooted as an origins film but it is a lacklustre pastiche of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) works as a poor bike courier in London, unable to afford to go to university. Even though her missing father Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) controlled many companies now run by associate Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas.)Lara could claim her father's companies and fortune if she legally declared him dead. However Lara finds a clue that leads to a message to destroy his research about Queen Himiko's tomb. She goes off to Hong Kong to look for her father and his search for the mystical tomb on an island near Japan. As Lara's search progresses she learns new skills.An illogical story, a generic bad guy, some messy action scenes and Vikander lacks the pneumatic assets of Angelina Jolie. The film never progresses much from its video game roots."
"Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a poor bike courier in London. Under pressure from Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas), she decides to sign the papers declaring her missing father (Dominic West) dead and claim the family fortune. Before signing, she finds a clue which leads to her father's last quest to find Queen Himiko's tomb. She finds help from sea captain Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) and is captured by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who is using slave labor to dig for the tomb.This version of Croft intrigued me at first. Vikander is an interesting actress. The movie pulled me in by her losing that first fight. I was with her until I wasn't. Somewhere along the line, I got enough jumping to grab the edge of something or jumping to crash into something. It's a constant reminder that this is a video game movie and it won't stop. I kept thinking that I want a movie, not a video game pretending to be a movie. Eventually, I did lose interest but there is enough to recommend still."
"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
"I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece."
"'Epic movie! The graphics are out of this world. The voice is acting is on point, the plot is solid, the 4th wall breaks are subtle, and the characters are lovable. Oh, and the soundtrack and sound editing are amazing.\nLiterally nothing bad about this movie.'"
"'So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman. But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.'"
"The Coleman family have had problems (Mom's alcoholism, the near death of deaf daughter Max, stillbirth of baby Jessica) and, as a move to overcome these family wounds, they adopt Russian orphan Esther. She's very bright and intelligent, but there's something about her, as Mom Kate gradually comes to realise. Dad John can't see it, though.You're never quite certain what genre this film occupies, but it doesn't matter. It gets most of the clichÃ©s - jarring music, people suddenly appearing in mirrors, sudden loud noises etc. - out of the way early on and, for the last half or more, it's simply nerve-shreddingly tense and quite brutal on the audience. I wouldn't want to say more - this is not a film to give away too much to others about.The cast is excellent, but the three main youngsters are awesome - stunningly good.If you like movies which put you through the ringer, then this is one for you."
"Excellent film dealing with a dwarf who passes herself off as a 9 year old. If that isn't enough, she is criminally insane and utterly wreaks havoc on those who take her in.Miss Fuhrman is excellent as the supposed 9 year old. As Esther, she can be charming, polite and well-mannered. Watch her develop into an absolute monster as the film progresses. She is so manipulative.The part I really liked was where the psychiatrist was totally taken in by this person. She actually blames the adopted mother for what is going on.The film highlights how out-of-country adoptions can be so very dangerous.The family is caught in a vicious web. This person will do whatever is necessary, no matter how bad it is, to attain her goals."
"'Writer/Director Jordan Peele\'s Follow-Up to the Immensely Popular and Critically Acclaimed Get Out (2018) is a Tense and Bloody Psychological Social Study.All Elements, Acting, Cinematography, Score, and, of course, Writing and Directing are Superb and Accomplished Far Beyond what\'s Expected from a Beginning Filmmaker.The Multi-Layered Story, that Runs almost 2 Hours, is Never Dull or Lacking in Scares, Suspense, and Build-Up to the Final Reveal.Much of the Slaughter and Gore takes place Off-Screen, but the Bloody-Aftermath is Forever Present.It\'s a much more Personally Terrifying Story than Most Horror Movies.It is Massaged with some Well-Placed and Off-Beat, yet Appropriate Humor.The Strange Musical Score with Emphasis on Sounds and Drawn-Out Musical Strains is Eerie and Enhances the Mood Considerably.The Underlying Thesis is mostly Revealed but some Ambiguity Remains for Consideration.Overall, Another Winner for Peele, the Cast and the Entire Production Crew.It\'s Really a Treat for Fans used to Less than Stellar Entries in the Overload of Cheap and Not Very Well Done Movies in the Genre.'"
"In 1986, a girl wanders away from her father in a carnival fair. She is shocked by a doppelganger. In the present day, the Wilson family is on vacation. They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is."
"'This is not flashy or shiny and it may not really cover your need for grandness. Just because this is slow burning, does not make it bad, but it may make it an experience some viewers will not like. It\'s about taste, what you like in a movie and what you expect from it. If you take the acting, the way this is assembled, the symbolic meanings, the soundtrack, the dialog, the structure ... it is almost flawless. And I say almost because there is always something you can detect that you may feel (or is) flawed.You may know or kind of get where this is going, but it doesn\'t take away the fun one can have with it. As I mentioned above this has all the right ingredients and has some wow moments too. It does not shy away from depicting or showing the violence and it has social messages. Whether you see them or not is another thing - or even care for them. Wicked idea and really good interpretation of it'"
"SICARIO is an intense and gritty drug war thriller that follows an FBI agent as she teams up with some DEA agents to wage war on drug gangs in south-of-the-border Mexico. It's a film that features oodles of gritty realism, along with graphic depictions of violence and the like, much like Denis Villeneuve's previous movie PRISONERS. The grand, epic-style action sequences that fuel SICARIO make it a superior film to that, although I still found it a little lacking.Despite the length of the film and the big speeches and the like, the story actually turns out to be very simplistic and little different from the story lines in an average low rent action flick. I'm no fan of Emily Blunt, aside from her role in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, and as in LOOPER she feels out of place here. Luckily you get veteran genre actors like Benicio Del Toro to balance things out a bit. Some of the establishing shots, like of the convoy of soldiers riding through the streets of Mexico, are quite breathtaking, and the film has an excellent soundtrack that adds plenty of suspense to the proceedings. Overall, I did find it all a little hollow though."
"'. . . the population of Juarez, Mexico, and any other non-Americans currently within 100 miles of the U.S. fence far enough south so that they\'re no longer within this international buffer zone. If we were being informed of what\'s ACTUALLY happening in places such as Chandler, AZ (where SICARIO shows how Mexican cartel members slaughtered 42 random American collegians and dry-walled them in a single suburban home in observance of pagan customs) EVERY U.S. citizen (except maybe those like the sniveling, bleeding-heart, by-the-book FBI agent cry-baby and drug-lord enabler played in SICARIO by Emily Blunt) would be demanding AT LEAST a 100-mile-wide No Go Zone down South. As SICARIO proves, our border presently is riddled with drug terrorist tunnels, and any crime-lord committing genocide against America can buy his way out of detention by bribing the authorities of this totally corrupt society (as happened this summer with the prison tunnel guy). Maybe some Americans have forgotten that we already have won the entire nation of Mexico in the Battle of Vera Cruz. As the U.N. mandates, to the victor go the spoils. That 100-mile-wide No-Go buffer zone now features little but squalor and human suffering. When it\'s totally depopulated (and policed 24/7/365 by the U.S. Air Force and drone program), Americans will be MUCH better off, and Mexicans won\'t be any worse. See SICARIO--and vote for change!'"
"Just watched this on Netflix disc with my mom. She was perhaps puzzled by many scenes especially the ending. She certainly wasn't in love with J.K. Simmons' pretty sadistic music teacher character. Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash."
"What a performance or better performances. It was about the time JK Simmons got recognized (read won an award)! And it couldn't have been a more rewarding role than this. If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to.We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had. It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved. There is not much light in this, but there doesn't need to be - it's perfect just the way it is (or is it?)"
"DEADPOOL 2 is the sequel to the surprisingly funny superhero spoof starring Ryan Reynolds. Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed. The X-Men parallels are fun and the plot keeps you guessing, with a string of quirky supporting characters proving a match for our hero. Hardly a ground-breaking movie, but it does entertain and that's what matters."
"So me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this today and like the previous Deadpool, we both highly enjoyed this one as well! There's a tragedy at the beginning but things pick considerably after that. As before, the leading character breaks the fourth wall in his narration and onscreen and other stuff referring to other superhero movies make this quite funny most of the time. Also, we once again see some of the X-Men characters from the previous one appearing to help Deadpool whether he wants it or not as well as some new ones who also are welcome additions. So that's a high recommendation of Deadpool 2 from both of us!"
"Sometimes things are just so wrong. Just a short time after Amanda (America Olivo ) gets us all excited, she flames out leaving us frustrated and wanting more.Things happen fast and furious from that point, and we realize that the movie hasn't really started as we are zapped six weeks into the future. Five people are gone, presumably dead, and we have a whole new group.We don't know what happened to Whitney (Amanda Righetti), and now her brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) is looking for her.Another throat slashed as the rag comes off and the hockey mask goes on.What is it with great breast and a quick death? Chelsea (Willa Ford) goes water-skiing topless and Jason (Derek Mears) lets her know what he thinks.We now know that he has been keeping Whitney alive for some reason. She has to watch him haul in the dead bodies.Trent (Travis Van Winkle) and Bree (Julianna Guill) are getting it on big time, You know she will be next. The only thing that can save her is the fact that there are two minorities present. Don't they always go first? Oh, Yes, Jason really showed some stuff with Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta).I watched Friday the 13th for two reasons. I'm guessing by now that I am going to be cheated out of one.If you are looking for a good slasher movie and you are not hung up on the title, Friday the 13th is good.Perfect ending!"
'What an engrossing biographical film. It makes me so sad and disappointed that the prison system can treat people so badly. I really admire the prisoners who never lose hope and never give up. It is a very moving story.'

"Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), his daughter Elizabeth and Lieutenant James Norrington (Jack Davenport) rescue boy Will Turner from a burning wreck on their way to Port Royal. Elizabeth hides Will's gold pirate medallion. Eight years later, Governor Swann is trying to set up Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) with the fast rising Norrington but she is still taken with Will (Orlando Bloom), now a swordsmith. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) rescues Elizabeth from the water but he is set to hang for being a pirate. He escapes but Will helps catch him. Meanwhile the gold pirate medallion has called in Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) on the haunted Black Pearl to attack the port. Barbossa kidnaps Elizabeth with the medallion. Will frees Sparrow to pursue her.The movie is bombastic, chaotic and messy. It's great to have Knightley and Bloom but it is Johnny Depp who steals the film. It is such a crazy performance that it is bigger than everything else. Without it, this movie would be a messy muddled thing. With it, this is a wonderful brilliant exuberant fun mess. In a film overstuffed with CGI, big sets and wild characters, Depp has a neon sign flashing over him in one of the most original performance ever in movie history."
It's super man again but this time it has a different name
"Interesting concept, but quickly it becomes obvious that the writer/director's concept was too clever for its own good. Many holes in the concept and plot. Plus, there is an attempt to build a moral implication and stand to a fictitious, barely-believable, concept. Quite lame.After the initial scene setting, the movie quickly degenerates into stock-standard chases and action sequences. So, quite predictable after a point.Solid enough performance from Justin Timberlake. Amanda Seyfried and Cillian Murphy are OK. Pity Olivia Wilde only has a minor part."
"Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While I don't think this was one of the best movies of last year (True Grit and The King's Speech were more worthy to me), The Social Network was certainly quite an attention-grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher's going back and forth from the depositions to the actual-if a little fabricated-events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co-founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors. Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co-founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter's betrayal. So on that note, The Social Network is well worth the viewing."
"'If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn\'t know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the Facebook movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can\'t really answer that, but I\'m guessing he read the book, the main character of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don\'t know, but it\'s not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder. And Mr. Timberlake might finally get recognized as a real actor, too. He\'s earned it.'"
"'Starting in 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) with the help and money from his roommate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) first create a website called FaceMash where pictures of female students are pitted against each other to create a ranking. This got him into trouble with the school, and recruited by Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) to work on their social networking site. However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as \'Facebook\' with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks.Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin. The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg. Fincher\'s directions infuse the movie with energy. And Garfield creates humanity in his character. This Zuckerberg is a stand-offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority. It is an unique character and an unique film.'"
"Is it weird that the only less-than-perfect element is Miranda's performance? I guess if he's gonna pull something this insanely brilliant out of his brain, he gets to do what he wants...because honestly, no amount of obnoxious contrarianism or misplaced virtue-signaling wokeness can change the fact that this is THE epic historical piece of storytelling of our generation. SIDE NOTE: Eliza's final gasp is the most haunting filmed image of 2020."
"Well, I don't really know how to evaluate this picture. It's not really a movie, but a filmed production of stage play before an audience with the original Broadway cast. I'm not really big on musicals to begin with, and when you tamper with historical accuracy it's a bit much to take in. So on one side, there's no denying the amount of work and effort that went into this effort. The energy level, costuming and lively presentation all make for a richly entertaining experience for those who enjoy this type of spectacle. On the other hand, retooling history with an agenda of diversity doesn't sit well with this viewer, so it was difficult to maintain any semblance of an attention span. Based solely on it's value as an entertainment vehicle, the movie deserves a top rating, but given my reservations about it's substance, I'll be fair minded and offer my rating of '8'."
"'The Big Short is a good film but also a film that would be tough for the average viewer to enjoy and understand. This is because although the housing bubble\'s burst was a mess and destroyed a lot of peoples\' lives, few folks really understand it. Sure, folks know that the banks were foolish as were home buyers (since they couldn\'t possibly afford these homes)....but that\'s about as far as their understanding goes. And, with the film tossing around all sorts of insider jargon, it\'s sure to confuse more than entertain.What I would LOVE to see is a pop-up video version of the film with explanatory text appearing on the screen throughout the movie to further clarify what is happening. I\'ve seen several Japanese import films like this--and they helped to explain cultural references that most non-Japanese viewers would miss.The bottom line is that I am extremely well educated compared to the average person and yet I sometimes felt a bit lost. Enjoyable but best watched with an economics professor sitting in the room to explain it all in detail.'"
We all know why they made this movie. You pay these kids next to nothing. And you promote it as a party movie. It's a classic money making move. The surprise here is that this was actually a pretty good movie. The kids aren't necessarily that likable or great actors. All of it is mostly recycled old teen movie parts. But it's the energy that so great. The utterly over the top chaos in this movie is just too much fun to ignore. The flamethrower does go too far. But it's too late to do any major damage. It just adds to the general chaos of this movie. Miles Teller is the biggest name to come out of this wild ride.
"'This film tells the story of a high school party turning out of control.There are a lot of films about high school party, but this one is probably is the craziest. The events escalate gradually to the point of being outrageous, which is what makes the film very entertaining. What is more, is that the story is almost believable!'"
"'Wow, awesome, epic. it was more than just a party movie. lots of awesome scenes with good music. very entertaining with lots of funny parts (2 viewings)\nSPOILERS\nkept getting bigger and crazier, more than i would have imagined.'"
"Adrenaline-pumping, heart-thumping, nerve-racking, spine-chilling - you will experience totality in this movie wrongly called as the Project X.Debut cast is epic and appreciate the producers for this noble idea. Animal House is surely reincarnated, so is the usual teenage comedy genre. Todd Phillips is a maverick when it comes to on the road, off the road movies with Hangover & Due Date in his credit, Project X is just another feather in his hat. Screenplay is perfect.Elements, except that of drug were totally binding and each event gives you more stuffs to enjoy and speculate what might happen next. Lots of teenage fun, naked bodies, madness and total anarchy is what the lead character Thomas's house is full of. Even the police are intimidated at one point. Such a ridiculously enthralling movie, Project X is recommended to everyone out there - young & old!WATCH OUT FOR: The beat soundtrack!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOLanguage: Yes | Sex: Strong | Nudity: Very Strong | Drugs: Strong | Alcohol: Strong | Gore: No | Violence: Yes | Foreplay: Strong | Mouth- Kiss: Strong"
"Amy Adams plays Susan Morrow. She's an artist trapped in a loveless marriage with her husband Hutton (Armie Hammer). Then she receives a book from her first husband (Jake Gyllenhaal) that he wrote asking her to read it. She does and it brings back memories of her first marriage and what went wrong. We also see the book enacted out.Bleak, disturbing and depressing but fascinating. You see all three stories play out but it's never too difficult to follow. The tone is very dark and there's no humor to lessen it. It does end on an ambiguous note which can be seen a number of different ways. For the most part the acting is great. Hammer is terrible in his role but he's not really in the film enough to make a difference. Adams is great in her role but Gyllenhaal is incredible. He has two great characters to play and he does it to perfection. Twice he explodes and it's frightening to watch. A bleak but very powerful film. Recommended."
"'This film tells the story of a wealthy art gallery owner, whose marriage is falling apart as her husband is having an affair. She relives memories of her life with her ex-husband, when her ex-husband sends her a copy of a manuscript of a violent story he has written.Nocturnal Animals has a powerful story line because of the subject matter that is detailed in the violent manuscript. This plot within the plot is very powerful, and is very engagingly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Shannon. The survivor guilt, grief and anger are all effectively portrayed. It is sad that the system could not do much about the perpetrator of such horrible crimes, which makes viewers feel even more for Tony Hastings. As for the art gallery owner subplot, it is told in a subtler manner. We can see her grieving too, but in a different way compared to Tony Hastings. Her subplot is unresolved, as opposed to to the manuscript subplot.I was quite surprised to see that this film is directed by Tom Ford. This is such a different film compared to his last film A Single Man\'. It would be interesting to see what he will direct next.'"
"'The Devil All the Time (2.5 out of 5 stars).The Devil All the Time is a crime drama film with a talented cast ensemble that involves a dull story about religious themes. Sexual predators. And police corruption.The plot follows Willard (Bill Skarsgaard) who is a vet. Comes home and falls in love with a waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett). They have a son. Willard becoming obsessed with praying to god. And teaching his son about facing bullies and fear. While Helen (Mia Wasikowska) falls for a preacher who tries to believe that god is testing him. Years go by,Arvin (Tom Holland) and his step sister Lenora (Eliza Scanlen) who are close. She meets a shady preacher Preston (Robert Pattinson). While a corrupt officer Lee (Sebastian Stan) is trying to get reelection while trying to hide his sister Sandy (Riley Keough) and her husband Carl (Jason Clarke) behaviors. Not knowing they are picking up hitchiking guys and the husband letting them having sex with his wife.It is a slow moving dull story that feels very thin. While coming across abuse, sexual predators like priest preying on young girls. And corruption.The script narrative is also annoying that could have been done without.The cast ensemble is great though that delivered there performances. Tom Holland playing a serious role. Robert Pattinson and Jason Clarke playing very dark roles. Bill Skarsgaard doing a great job.Overall, it was a slow and dull direction crime drama. That could have been shorter. And better narrative dialogue.'"
"'The Devil All the Time is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a story of a man who is returning from the war and trying to find his place in the world through god. He starts a family with his loved one but many things will change in his life and his family\'s too.I liked this movie because it was a big surprise for me since I did not have high expectations. The plot was very interesting and it was consisted of many good scenes with much of suspense which were combined very well with drama. The interpretations of Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd who played as Willard, Tom Holland who played as Arvin, Riley Keough who played as Sandy and Robert Pattinson who played as Reverent Preston Teagardin were simply amazing and very different from what we have already watched them play. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was Jason Clarke who played as Carl and he was very good at it. Lastly, I have to say that The Devil All the Time is a nice movie and surprisingly good, I highly recommend everyone to watch it.'"
"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy.This is a jumble. There is a lot here. There are some good performances. SkarsgÃ¥rd is especially good. The cast is terrific. There is a sense of places and times. It would be nice if the story could be simplified to just Arvin's life. There is too much story with too many characters although it's never confused. I love the themes of religion and death. I also love that this movie is going for something expansive. It's probably going for too much."
"Just by the title I was expecting a horror movie, but it's a crime/drama, even though you could concider it as a horror since it's very religious and what is more horrorful than religion? The Devil All The Time is a quite long movie but it doesn't feel like that because there are multiple stories that in a way are all connected to each other and they are all very captivating to watch. The cast is excellent, with a lot of good actors like Robert Pattinson, Tom Holland, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd, Eliza Scanlen etc. Robert Pattinson, once an actor I didn't really appreciate (probably because of those dumb Twilight series) is a totally different actor now that did a very good job playing his character. This movie has different stories and they're all very religion themed, what makes it interesting to watch. As an atheist I always find it fascinating to watch very religious people believing the most idiotic things and in The Devil All The Time you get a lot of those scenes, if not all of them. There's a fair amount of murdering so it's more a crime than a drama and that's what makes this movie worth watching."
"'Each try to define it sounds fake. Because, first, it represents a surprise. A nice one, in my case. The motif is real simple - it is well crafted work, using different recipes, each giving its best in a fascinating embroidery. Including the cliches. And that makes the things different . It is not only a good horror, but a special one for the status of challenge for viewer and for the well manner to give the right story . And, sure, for Sigourney Weaver presence.'"
"Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.The trouble with writing a review for this film is that I risk giving too much away, so I will just not say anything at all. The creators -- Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon -- have taken the horror genre and turned it on its head. The themes that have been done to death are satirized here while maintaining a scary atmosphere.What a shame that this film got caught up in MGM's financial problems and took almost three years to get released. Chris Hemsworth needs more exposure, and Richard Jenkins never disappoints."
"There are not a lot of franchises that are good from the beginning till the end but Jumanji is an exception to that rule. The quality of the movies is constant so if you liked the first or the second movie you will probably like this one as well. I always have a lot of pleasure watching any of the Jumanji movies. There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch. And even if the story is basically the same in all Jumanji movies it's still entertaining, that says enough about the quality of these movies. I'm not done with Jumanji, I could watch another one."
"'This is a fun and funny adventure! The suspension bridge scene really got my palms sweating. There is a big emphasis on friendship and bonding, and I really like this theme. It is a great escapist adventure, both for the characters and the viewers!'"
"'If you enjoy the Jumanji movie franchise, then you will definitely also enjoy this 2019 addition. You know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch the movie, and writers Jake Kasdan, Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg definitely deliver as expected.There is an abundance of fast-paced action, funny characters, witty banter and dialogue, as well as a very wholeheartedly entertainment value to the movie. It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then Jumanji: The Next Level definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch Jumanji: The Next Level regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating Jumanji: The Next Level a six out of ten stars.'"
"Recently, our deep in trouble mall brought back it's first video arcade in many years. Well, this movie upgraded it's cast from the first one, and it doesn't lose a thing versus the earlier film. I'm not sure if an arcade now will be in time to save our mall (though it would help if they brought movie theaters back into too), but this movie is entertaining and a whole lot of funny.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Heart, and additions like veteran Danny Devito are all positive in this one. The plot is exactly the same as the first time around, another video game of Jumanji only with real people thrown into the game. If anything, the script is a solid item indeed and the cast brings it off.The film never gives a viewer much chance tro rest. There's action on top of action, just like the video game. If they make enough of these, there will come a day when a marathon of them will be playing, and playing and playing and maybe, just maybe the next game will rescue our ailing mall. A lot of malls are being turned into Senior Housing. Rushing in a good game of Jumanji could improve sales- at the Tom Brady Scooter store.Put your brain away and enjoy this action film."

The ambitious Louis is a sociopath and for him gore means a better payment for his footages. So he leaves the position of crime photographer to interfere in crime scenes, climbing in his new career. Nightcrawler is a weird and original movie with one of the bleakest characters that I have recently seen on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal has an impressive performance in the role of an ambitious sociopath that is capable to do anything to climb in his new job. The plot is totally unpredictable and mesmerizes the viewer that can not foresee the next move of Louis. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): O Abutre (The Volture)'"
"There are not many actors who can do that creepy thing and still pull the viewer in. Don't get me wrong the script is amazing too, but you need someone like Jake Gyllenhaal to pull the main role off. The movies pace is slow though and this might not be exactly what everyone will love. You have to be patient and you have to go through tough scenes and character drama to watch this.It's a man on a mission thing and the question that can be raised is: Chicken or egg? Who's fault is it really? Because you do get pressured into certain situations which make some people break. Especially if they were on the edge anyway ... or over it a long time ago ... Whatever the case, be prepared for some tough watching ... literally."
"Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty thieve in L.A. He encounters Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is filming a car crash. He decides to get into the business of freelance videography for the local news. He is unrestrained in his filming which is exactly what news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) needs to raise her low ratings. Desperate Rick answers his ad to be his assistant. This is great acting from Gyllenhaal. His crazy eyes pull in the audience right away. In fact, it's shocking to see his gaunt figure. His mannerisms are really creepy. The story is driven by this great performance and the tension never lets up."
"'it is not a comfortable film. it is not easy to understand it. not for the message or theme or script. but for the balance with strong emotions and for the force of the images from the last part. it is a film about a competition and about ballet behind the scene. but, in essence, it is portrait of social struggle who reminds vulnerabilities of its public. Natalie Portman does a surprising great job. for the wise manner to discover her character to the viewer. for the science to explore the script for a sensational image of new Faust. for the strong fight of the final scenes. for the metamorphose who is not only credible but becomes experience of the viewer. a rare film about a delicate theme who has the right director and the inspired cast.'"
"'In New York, the twenty-eight year-old Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a dedicated and perfectionist ballerina of the ballet company that lives with her controller mother and former ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey). The director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to renovate the company for the next season that will open with the Swan Lake with a new face and retires the prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder). Nina is his first option to perform The Swan Queen, perfect for the role of the White Swan, but too restrained to perform the Black Swan. Nina feels threatened by the newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis), who can perfectly perform the Black Swan, and is stressed with the situation. When Nina has a nervous breakdown, she gets in contact with her dark side and has constant nightmarish daydreams.Black Swan is a beautiful but predictable film of Darren Aronofsky, with a cinematography that gives a nightmarish environment to the story that is too dark for a drama and too dramatic for a horror movie. Natalie Portman has a great performance but her character is too naive and with lack of confidence for a New Yorker indicated to be the prima ballerina of a ballet company. The theme is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the case of split personality but the film does not justify the hype around it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Cisne Negro (Black Swan)'"
"I read a bunch of very negative reviews on here for this movie and in my opinion those are a bit exaggerated. I agree that it's not the best DC-Comics movie ever made but it's certainly entertaining enough to have a good movie night. Margot Robbie is perfect to play Harley Quinn. It's a character that fits her really well. The plot is probably not perfect but it's never boring. It's all fast paced so you just relax and enjoy the ride, just what I expect from these kind of movies."
"'The Greatest Showman is a highly entertaining musical based on highlights of the life of the American entertainer P.T. Barnum, but never in his biography. The dramatization, art direction, cast and the choreography are excellent and the result may be not what the professional critics expect to see (like the snobbish character in the film), but certainly will be very pleasant for the audiences where I include myself. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): O Rei do Show (The King of the Show)'"
"'This film tells the story of the son of a tailor, who is determined to make it rich and famous, in order to be accepted by the high society.The story makes me tear up with joy many many times. The fact that it celebrates diversity makes it a heartwarming film. It values human beings just as they are, and gives off a strong and empowering message that you can still shine no matter what shape or size you are. The songs are upbeat and catchy, and the shows are beautiful to watch. I truly enjoyed, and was thoroughly touched by this musical.'"
"'I\'m not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can\'t see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song This is me is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.Every song has its purpose (still of course you can question the why people would start just sing and dance as if they had choreographed it in advance - well they have, but you know what I mean) and it works. Be it the comedy numbers (Hugh and Zac in one instance in a bar just to name one example) or as dramatic pieces. Hugh has so much fun it transcends the screen ... if you are way worse with Musicals than me, maybe don\'t watch it .. otherwise give it a shot! But most definitely do listen to the song This is me ... phenomenal!'"
"Impoverished Phineas Barnum marries a girl from a rich family against the wishes of her parents, and proceeds to make his fortune by presenting displays of the rare and unusual, including people with attributes which have them labelled as freaks.Hugh Jackman plays Barnum in a musical celebration of the positive elements of his career (as a frosty critic tells him, some might say that it is a celebration of humanity). His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride. Well, content-wise it is fairly standard fictional biopic stuff, but the musical numbers are the best I can recall for some time."
"Oh it's fab.Very rarely does a film come along that makes such an impact with the general public for pretty much a whole year.With a lovely story, and some stellar performances this has 'classic' written all over it."
"Jared Leto plays Harry, a junkie who, along with pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), hopes to make a killing buying drugs and reselling it on the streets; meanwhile, Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) becomes dependent on uppers in a bid to lose weight ready for an appearance on a TV game show. As time passes, Harry winds up with an infected arm, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) resorts to prostituting herself for her next fix, his mum goes completely loopy, and Tyrone ends up in prison.I understand that, having graduated from film school, a young director will be keen to show off some of what they have learnt. In Requiem for a Dream, Darren Aronofsky goes all out, chucking in everything including the kitchen sink. Not one second goes by without a 'cool' film-making technique being thrust in the viewers face, whether it be split screen, time lapse, rapid repetitive editing, or Snorricam. It's all there, to such an extent that it pulls the viewer out of the film, as opposed to immersing them (which I believe was the intention).Aronofsky is so enamoured with his clever visual trickery that he neglects to develop his characters beyond the basics or tell a decent story beyond the bleeding obvious: that drugs are bad."
"'This the story of Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), a pretty girl with blond hair who is also a brilliant student (how original it is!). With her boyfriend, Emmett Richmond (Luke Wilson), they are living love\'s dream. But one day, he\'s leaving her by announcing him that he\'s engaging in a politic career. For this, he\'ll study law in a brilliant university. You can guess easily Witherspoon\'s feelings: sadness, frustration but revenge too. In order to have her revenge and to get her darling again, she\'s registering in the same university... This is from this moment on that the movie becomes poor. Legally Blonde is a bad movie because it\'s based on a cock and bull screenplay that often falls into foolishness and it includes several unlikelinesses. Even in one hour and a half, you find time to get bored and this movie that is supposed to be a comedy isn\'t funny at all, in the long run. So I can\'t believe that this movie is rather well marked: 6.6 out10!.Uneventful and boring. At a pinch can we save Reese Witherspon \'s rather good performance.'"
"Legally Blonde has Reese Witherspoon playing Elle a vacuous blonde who anticipates a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Warner Huntington III but instead gets dumped.Warner plans to study law at Harvard and in a stalkerish move, Elle follows suit and somehow gets accepted hoping Warner changes his mind about her.At Harvard, Elle has trouble being accepted by Warner's friends and by the more intense students.However she applies herself and gets to assist in a murder trial and manages to show that she has more skills in the application of the law.This is a light, breezy film turned into a hit musical thanks to producer of the film Marc Platt who also produced 'Wicked' on stage.It has all the beats with Elle struggling at Law School then being befriended by Luke Wilson. She then becomes part of the defence attorney team for Ali Larter who stands trial for murder.Witherspoon is winning in the lead role and brings likability but the film is all froth."
Not bad at all from what it is. I'm not the target market so if you're a fan of Hollywood comedy you'll probably want to rate it higher. It starts out as another offputting 'airhead' type comedy but then offers a different perspective on the legal system and as such it remains fresh and funny throughout. Witherspoon in particular works hard in this one and her commitment pays off.
"'Alex Garland\'s Ex Machina struck me as a warning about over-reliance on technology. Like Frankenstein and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it depicts human creations that turn out to be more than we can handle. I found Oscar Isaac\'s CEO to be the most interesting character in the movie. Nathan\'s lively, articulate personality is a stark contrast to Caleb\'s soft-spoken attitude. The Turing test (an assessment of a machine\'s ability to display human characteristics) should be of more interest to us now that The Imitation Game has drawn attention to Alan Turing.Ex Machina won\'t be a movie for everyone. Despite the science fiction themes, it\'s a deliberately slow-moving film. It takes time to acquaint oneself with the characters and their true aims. But it turns out to be a interesting movie. It\'s not any kind of masterpiece, but I recommend it.'"
"'What makes us human? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he\'s a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially bro Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It\'s really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren\'t there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn\'t he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain\'t. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it'"
"Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Sonoya Mizuno. Music is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and cinematography by Rob Hardy.A young programmer is thrilled to be selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment involving synthetic intelligence. He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10"
"'I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn\'t overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It\'s not Lord Of The Rings, of course, but it\'s still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I\'ve seen now.I don\'t buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff, just enjoying the special-effects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. Ron squeaks half the time he talks!As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language.'"
'Directed by James Wan who also directed a little horror flick STYGIAN in 2000. Wan collaborates with one of the stars Leigh Wannell in the screenplay. SAW is a grisly nightmare of a movie. Adam(Wannell)finds himself waking up in a seedy abandoned building basement with his leg chained to a huge pipe. Across the room is a young doctor Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes)also chained by the leg. In between them is the corpse of a gunshot victim holding a tape recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket explaining what is expected of them...mainly Dr. Gordon gets to live if he kills off Adam within a fixed amount of time. Each man has access to a hack saw...just in case they want to free themselves by cutting off their foot. Detective David Tapp(Danny Glover)has a personal reason to be obsessed with finding the thrill killer responsible for this horrid situational game. This atmospheric chiller deserves the chance to disturb you. Also in the cast are: Shawnee Smith and Dina Meyer.'
"'Saw is the sort of movie which you would expect to be completely gross, but it manages to have a plot. Two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), wake up chained to pipes in a putrid bathroom with a dead body in the middle. They come to realize that, although there are saws which they can use to cut the pipes, they are not supposed to do that. As the movie progresses, we learn more and more about secrets that both men have, some of which relate to the perpetrator of this ugly situation.The movie is gruesome all the way through, but rarely disgusting. You should not watch this movie if you have a weak stomach.I would never have guessed that Danny Glover could do horror (he plays a detective investigating the case), but he does a really good job here.'"
"'WWII American Army Medic Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield), who served during the Battle of Okinawa, refuses to kill people, and becomes the first man in American history to receive the Medal of Honor without firing a shot.Based on the posters and previews and such, I really thought this was going to be a war movie. And, of course, in many ways it is, since much of the second half takes place on the battlefield. But there is much more here -- romance, morality, and the strong will of Doss, an unusual Seventh Day Adventist.What made this film especially great was the inclusion of Vince Vaughn. Although he never turned the film into a comedy, he brought a humor to the story that really made it well-rounded and enjoyable. That was a fine bit of casting.'"
"'There aren\'t many moments in the movie that aren\'t intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I\'m not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in The Passion of the Christ and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One\'s attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man\'s perseverance, exemplified by Glass\'s own words in my summary line above.'"
"'Every bit as good as Henry Selick\'s masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas. Like that one, the film finds a perfect balance between beautiful and creepy. I would describe it as a children\'s horror film. In fact, I think this might go down as one of the scariest children\'s films ever made. The story is about a young girl, Coraline, who finds an odd doorway in her new house that leads to a mirror-image world, where her parents pay attention to her and give her anything she wants. It\'s wonderful, but odd Â everyone has black buttons for eyeballs. Coraline\'s first few trips to the alternate world are fun, but soon her other mother insists that she get her own buttons. The story is familiar. It reminded me a lot of Pan\'s Labyrinth and Spirited Away. The plot also takes a couple of obvious shortcuts that don\'t make a lot of sense. Fortunately, these things are hard to notice when you\'re watching Selick\'s eye-popping design. Pixar\'s got its work cut out for it if it wants to win Best Animated Film at next year\'s Oscar ceremony. It also has one of the most amazing musical scores I\'ve heard in a while, by Bruno Coulais.'"
"'When Coraline moves to an old house, she feels bored and neglected by her parents. She finds a hidden door with a bricked up passage. During the night, she crosses the passage and finds a parallel world where everybody has buttons instead of eyes, with caring parents and all her dreams coming true. When the Other Mother invites Coriline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her.Coraline is a dark and creepy animation that follows the style of Tim Burton in Corpse Bride or The Nightmare Before Christmas with non- likable characters. In addition, there is no subtle message for children. Therefore, it seems to be primarily recommended to adult audiences. The nightmarish environment is supported by awesome cinematography and a great music score. None of the characters is totally likable .My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Coraline'"
"Van Helsing is written and directed by Stephen Sommers. It stars Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor and Alun Armstrong. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Allen Daviau.Famed monster hunter Van Helsing (Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula's (Roxburgh) fiendish plan involving the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man.Well it was universally savaged by the pro critics and is considered a flop. Yet whilst understanding those things, it does for a reason hold above average ratings on the big internet movie sites. It did find a market (and continues to do so), it's like one big long MTV video, a sort of chaotic monster fun frolic in rock opera style.It's effects laden, which is no great thing since they are shoddy, and the dialogue is often as cringe worthy as some of the accents are. Yet it's still a thrilling ride, a strap yourself in and run with it job, to be in the company of sexy lead actors in Gothic garb and devilish period surrounds.Loud and boisterous for sure, and tacky at times, but exhilarating all the same for those after some pure escapist carnage. 5/10"
"'This is almost too silly for words, but I did like the idea of bringing back Frankenstein, Count Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and the Wolf Man together, all in one picture. Well, not really the Wolf Man, but close enough. It was almost like Van Helsing\'s (Hugh Jackman) sidekick Carl (David Wenham) was challenging the script writers with one of his own lines - How many commandments can we break in one day? Yet the production design is pretty good, and the principal players are easy enough on the eyes. The action scenes are pretty frantic, even if some of the CGI employed is a bit dodgy. I don\'t know about the flying vampire brides though, they could have been a bit sexier. The story reaches it\'s epic conclusion when the Werewolf Gabriel puts the bite on the Satanic Dracula. You want to know who they were, you\'ll have to watch the picture. I can\'t give everything away here.'"
"Overblown and a bit silly, but more than enough rousing CGI action to hold your interest. Scripted chaos with elementary cheesy dialogue. Let your eyes overrule your brain and VAN HELSING is a never-ending battle against the forces of evil. Fabled monster hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman)is summoned to take on Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and a somewhat redefined Count Dracula(Richard Roxburgh). First he has to deal with Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane)in a bell tower. Upon arriving in Transylvania he enters a love/hate relationship with Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale)and together they battle lovely swift-winged female vampires and deal with Anna's brother who has become a werewolf.My favorite scene is of the horse drawn carriage winding and navigating snow covered Transylvania and jumping the destroyed bridge. I also liked watching Van Helsing blow holes in the voluptuous vampires with his gas powered spear gun. Also in the cast are: David Wenham, Elena Anaya, Kevin J. O'Connor and Will Kemp. Jackman seems to come off as a poor man's Indiana Jones. And not to take anything away from the attractive Beckinsale...but give her role to Catherine Zeta-Jones and you'll have a more spectacular movie."
"It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura. They're on the run from a corporation which created Laura and other mutant children to be super-soldiers. Its thugs are looking to recapture the escaped subjects.The movie is hard and bloody. It mines the well-worn relationship between Logan and Professor X bringing a feral little girl into the mix. The connection is ingrained. It takes the superhero joy of violence and makes it brutal. I would have liked a little more jokey humor between odd couple Logan and X. Overall, it's good bloody brutal violence with a familiar relationship and some new ones."
"I thought this was bags of fun, who said that satire was a thing of the past, Jojo Rabbit prices that it is alive and well..It's one of those films that will have you laughing one minute, crying the next, then awkwardly chuckling in the scene after that.It's very well acted, very well made, the production values are actually very, very strong.I saw this on its release with a few friends, it was my choice, faces were pulled at the thought of it, but everyone enjoyed, one quibbled before the film that she thought it was going to be offensive, it isn't, it's all tongue in cheek.I look forward to seeing it again, I recommend. 8/10."
"'This film set in Nazi Germany is really quite different from the rest. It approaches the difficult and painful topic in a light hearted manner, while still maintaining respect. The ending leaves many things to the unsaid, which makes it more powerful. I enjoyed it a lot.'"
"A character study of obsession and growing madness, this is a film which makes up for a dearth of action by incorporating lots of suspense and subtle increases in tension into the running time. It's an exercise in psychological creepiness, boasting a near-flawless performance from Robin Williams, whose acting is introverted and subdued this time, instead of the awful loud comic character we have grown accustomed to from his earlier career. In fact, this might well be the best film of his long career. Without Williams, I'm not sure the film would be so successful in what it sets out to do; indeed, I can't imagine anyone else essaying the part as well as he does here: lonely, balding, blond-haired and totally alienated from the rest of society, he's a man without a life, whose obsession with a 'normal' family leads to tragedy.The surprising thing is that many scenes are riveting, despite not a lot happening. Moments when Williams faces the disapproval of his boss (Gary Cole, in another wonderfully nasty and impassioned turn) are engrossing, whilst the hotel set-piece at the finale keeps you guessing for as long as possible. Not sure I'm totally in favour of the (anti) climax, but at least it does away with clichÃ© and presents things in a far more realistic light than we often see in the movies. Sober, surprisingly intelligent and insightful: worth watching for Williams alone."
"'Robin Williams, one of the funniest people on the planet, has made a career of playing some very unpleasant people. In this one, he works at a Fotomat (now nearly extinct) and become the stalker of a family that brings their films to him for development. Not only does he stalk them, he knows everything about them, their birthday parties, their fights, their sporting events, etc. Of course, at some point he is going to inject himself into their lives. Fortunately, the scrip writers used some restraint and made this play out the way it should have (I won\'t\' spoil this for you). Suffice it to say that the trip is a scary one and we can\'t help but feel our flesh creep a bit. We also are made aware of his loneliness and his dysfunctional existence. He is a multidimensional figure, as quirky as one can get. After seeing The Social Network recently, I have to also say that we have created a societal voyeurism in our culture. This further shows how fragile our privacy is and how we are willing to sell it to the highest bidder.'"
"'An up and coming writer and director, Mark Romanek, wrote and directed the 2002 film, One Hour Photo starring Robin Williams. Williams plays Sy, a deeply disturbed man who runs the photo development booth at a discount store. He is obsessed with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has been developing since the son, Jake, was an infant. Having no life of his own, Sy parks his car outside the Yorkin house, runs into Mrs. York at a mall food court, and makes extra copies of their photos for his wall at home. Then he discovers, through another customer\'s photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy\'s isolation in the world. The film is very well done.One quibble I have is when Sy\'s boss (Gary Cole) questions Sy about the discrepancy in prints sold versus the excessive amount of prints made by the AGFA machine. Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams\' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well. Eriq LaSalle, formerly of E.R. plays a police detective.Without Romanek\'s fine touches, this would have been on the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Thanks to his sense of style, it isn\'t.'"
"'Lonely department store One Hour Photo guy Robin Williams (as Seymour Sy Parrish) lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for what seems like the perfect family: Full frontal father Michael Vartan (as William Will Yorkin), beautiful wife Connie Nielsen (as Nina Yorkin), and their cute nine-year-old son Dylan Smith (as Jakob Jake Yorkin). Soon, Mr. Williams is stalking the family; he watches young Smith play baseball, meets Ms. Nielsen at the Galleria food mart for lunch, and parks his car outside their home after work. When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world\'s best father, he goes Psycho.Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams\' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples: Maya\'s pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to unite in the hotel room. Jake\'s perceptions about Sy are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent point-of-view shot of Williams\' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker. And, while The Day the Earth Stood Still is a great old movie, why not substitute one that compliments Sav-Mart, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers? ******* One Hour Photo (1/13/02) Mark Romanek ~ Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen'"
"Edgar Wright directs and writes this action-packed crime drama about a young getaway driver named Baby (Ansel Elgort). Angel-faced Baby is hired as a driver for a series of bank heists by crime boss, Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby doesn't say much, but his high octane motivation is choreographed to his personal soundtrack, he constantly listens to. He meets a pretty young waitress named Debora (Lily James), that is the girl of his dreams. A botched robbery sends him on the run and he is hunted by the cops and his criminal boss and cohorts.Plenty of car chases with demolishing accidents; mass shootings, with machine-gun carnage all set to the beat of Baby's soundtrack that features tunes by the likes of Sam & Dave, R.E.M., Focus, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Barbara Lewis, The Commodores, Queen, T. Rex and Carla Thomas.The cast also features: Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez, Jon Hamm, CJ Jones and Jon Bernthal. I was most impressed with Miss James. Rated R for obvious reasons. See it once and you'll want to see it again!"
"This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso CuarÃ³n shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot."
"'A young girl is on vacation with her parents when she decides to go to town to hang out with a friend. It\'s there where she and her friend decide to go get high with a complete stranger. It is at that point that the lives of these two teenagers is flipped upside down.The first thought that may have entered your mind is probably somewhere along the lines of: Don\'t you know better? But of course, they were in a small town and the guy seemed so innocent... which he was; it was just his dad, dad\'s girlfriend and his uncle that were ape nuts.This movie was more about the toughness and tenacity of a teen and the resourcefulness and fight of a couple of regular parents than anything else. From the character development you gather that the girl and her family are the epitome of normal while the criminals in this movie are the epitome of psychotic. Without a doubt you find yourself wishing for the demise of the bad guys while hoping for the triumph of the captives. Of course, there are the Oh My God, why did you do that? moments that are customary for any thriller/horror flick.There have been better movies from this genre; either better stories, or more affable characters, or gorier, or more sinister, etc. but this movie holds its own.'"
"'A young girl is on vacation with her parents when she decides to go to town to hang out with a friend. It\'s there where she and her friend decide to go get high with a complete stranger. It is at that point that the lives of these two teenagers is flipped upside down.The first thought that may have entered your mind is probably somewhere along the lines of: Don\'t you know better? But of course, they were in a small town and the guy seemed so innocent... which he was; it was just his dad, dad\'s girlfriend and his uncle that were ape nuts.This movie was more about the toughness and tenacity of a teen and the resourcefulness and fight of a couple of regular parents than anything else. From the character development you gather that the girl and her family are the epitome of normal while the criminals in this movie are the epitome of psychotic. Without a doubt you find yourself wishing for the demise of the bad guys while hoping for the triumph of the captives. Of course, there are the Oh My God, why did you do that? moments that are customary for any thriller/horror flick.There have been better movies from this genre; either better stories, or more affable characters, or gorier, or more sinister, etc. but this movie holds its own.'"
"'This Bond film is well written and exciting, It shows us the way that the 007 legend began. We find how Bond takes advantage of a situation to make himself the guy with the license to kill. He begins to battle wits with the villain, LeChifre, who is in the center of international finance. He is also a gambler who is managing to make one hundred percent on his investments, Bond has to use every manner of effort to confront the barriers placed before him, including winning at cards. I remember the asinine first Hollywood version of this book, which came in the wake of some of the best serious Bond films. It had comedians Peter Sellers and Woody Allen and more silliness than you could shake a stick at. One thing I noticed is that the card game played was poker. In the book and the original movie, he plays Baccarat. Of course, hardly any Americans understand this game. In the first film there is a dramatic moment when a card is turned over and Bond wins...to this day, I don\'t know why!'"
"Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now."
"'Not too hard to realize that for half a century, we have shared ups and downs, and survived crisis after crisis with Agent 007. This is the 23 James Bond installment and third starring Daniel Craig, as that beloved cool and captivating super spy. Say too much, say too little; SKYFALL has a different feel for some reason. Everyone can find their own reason for dissing and hissing at this one. Bond is vulnerable and yet dynamic and again the man you can depend on. M16 comes under attack and so does the credibility of M(Judi Dench), as she must relocate the agency. Her past creeps in to haunt her and this new dilemma has her putting her only hope in 007 to uncover its origins. Bond will have the aid of agency field agent Eve(Naomi Harris)to challenge a new Chairman of Intelligence(Ralph Fiennes)and follow a treacherous trail of a mysterious madman(Javier Bardem). Explosion after explosion is typical, but having M playing a more active role is not. Somehow of course, the old saying proves true...there IS a reason for everything. I really found the use of Boom Boom by The Animals fitting. And you can\'t ignore the wonderful theme by Adele, that I feel will be memorable for a long time. Also in the cast: Rory Kinnear, Bill Buckhurst, Ben Whishaw, Berenice Marlohe and Ian Bonar.'"
"'An unknown bad guy (Javier Bardem) has obtained the list of all NATO nation covert operatives working inside terrorist cells. As he threatens to release them, an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) who appears to have lost a step, must go to Shanghai and appear in the obligatory casino scene and attempt to get back the computer file. This feature has the standard Bond lines, killer title track, sensual scenes, over the top chase action, as well as a return to Bond\'s roots.Judi Dench as M was superb. Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn\'t need anyone but himself. Worth a peek on the big screen.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, sensual scenes that implied sex, no nudity.'"
"'I hate to say it, but the critic Ebert got it exactly right. This is not a very good 007 movie. Daniel Craig as James Bond is a good action hero, but 007 is not an action hero, he is the master of cool. Ebert\'s review is a sort of call to restore the 007 themes to what we have come to expect, and I have to agree with him.Olga Kurylenko is the Bond Girl as Camille. (She reminded me very much of Catherine Zeta Jones in Mask of Zorro, both in looks and in voice.) She is appropriately pretty and exotic, but there wasn\'t any real chemistry with 007.The evil one is Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene who is leading an illicit effort to corner the water supply in Bolivia, but when the movie was over neither my wife or I could explain what the story line was. There is lots of action, but it is hard to figure out why everyone is after everyone else.Unusual 007 movie.'"
"I've previously been critical of Halloween follow ups, and some of Rob Zombie's films, but this, I thought excellent.The original is one of my favourite films, certainly my favourite horror film, it was a game changer. I had always shuddered at the thought of it being remade, but this, nowhere near the quality of the original, but it's a cracking movie.I'd call it quite a respectful remake, they of course out a new spin on it, but they keep some scenes, they even keep some of the music, I suppose they knew full well that some things were worth keeping.I loved the backstory of Michael, we see him go from troubled child to brutal killer.What it certainly is, is violent, not so much in terms of suspense, there are no scares, or those moments when you see him appear from a shadow, you get some brutal scenes, as you'd expect from Me Zombie.Nailed it, 8/10."
"The Scream franchise roars back with part 4 10 years after a slightly stale part 3 brought the original trilogy to a close.As self referential as ever, part 4 brings Sidney, Dewey and Gale back together as Sidney's autobiographical book tour comes to a close in Woodsboro on the 10th anniversary of the original killings. And, guess what, they start again.The pleasing mix of knowing movie reference, slasher killings, and who-is-it? works as well as ever, thanks to a new crop of suspects who, one by one, become victims. The slaughter is more graphic than before, in keeping with the direction slasher films have move in during the last 10 years. The script is deft, and the guessing is good and constantly misleading! Part 4 happily takes its place alongside the other 3 - it is just as good."
"Martin Scorcese magnificently directs this wild, funny and somewhat repugnant story based on Jordon Belfort's own tome. A bit long, but it is the most interesting and fast moving three hours you'll spend. An outstanding cast surrounding Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, a Long Island stockbroker that masterminded a massive securities fraud in the 1990s. This film depicts Belfort being a self-made man; albeit through partying hard, self over-medicating, no holds barred debauchery leading to his whirlwind approach leaving a mark on Wall Street. Belfort's charisma being able to attract followers in sharing his use of other people's hard earned money to live a life of beautiful women, exotic drugs, lavish homes and cars, and the utmost luxury making for a lush life. A master at scamming so well, he is a loud flaunting target for the FBI. It gets hard snitching on your closest friends, But Belfort manages to use the chance to garner a smaller stint in prison...36 months.Leave the kids at home, because THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is forewarned a deservedly hard R, due to strong sexual content, blatant drug use, language, violence and very graphic nudity. A strong supporting cast featuring: Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Rob Reiner, Kyle Chandler, Jon Bernthal and Matthew McConaughey."
"'Absorbing, taut thriller about a serial killer in San Francisco and the resulting havoc that is caused.The film is a continuous guessing game of leads, innuendos, and much more as the state of California struggles with these bizarre killings which are spread over several years.The acting here is top notch with commanding performances by Mark Ruffalo, as a police inspector heading the investigation, Robert Downey Jr., a reporter, caught up in the mayhem and acting in a way that you could be suspicious of him as well. In addition, Jake Gyllenhaal is in fine form as a cartoonist working for the San Francisco chronicle who becomes obsessed with finding the guilty.There are plenty of questions, threats and intimidation along the way.While the ending offers no complete solution, this is a film that really gets you to think.'"
"On July 4, 1969, a killer shoots a couple on lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. The boy survives. The San Francisco Chronicle receives a letter from the Zodiac killer to print his letters with symbols. Reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr) is on the case with the help of eager cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The brutal murders continue moving to San Francisco. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are given the case. Other police include Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Detective Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. Defense lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) appearing on TV gets a call from the supposed killer.This starts off as an interesting serial killer mystery. The attacks are horrifically shown. The couple forced to be tied up and stabbed is probably the most memorable. However the movie turns into something deeper. This is not another serial killer movie like the endless TV shows that populate modern networks. It may not even be about the central characters. This is an immersive experience living with the serial killer always on the mind. The Zodiac killer is just out there in this world. It's fascinating in its dark undertones and the lack of flashiness."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"'After Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City, Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.'"
"'This film tells the most severe case of haunting Ed and Lorraine Warren, two outstanding paranormal investigators, have ever seen.I am not a fan of horror movies, but The Conjuring truly blew me away. Everything from the plot, acting and the atmosphere of the film is superb. The story is believable, the family is likable and viewers are sympathetic of them stuck in a haunted house. The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, The Conjuring builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it. It is easily the scariest film I have ever seen.I was already impressed by Insidious, and The Conjuring makes me a fan of James Wan. When his next film comes out I will surely watch it.'"
"It's several years since this film was released, and I have to say that none of the shine has come off it, the quality is still very much there, the film is a classic. As a horror it packs in some real scares, but there is so much more to it, it has tension, a story, and some real intrigue, possibly because of the fact that it was inspired by real life events.Several films have followed, sequels and spin offs, but none of them come close to this, the only Horror film for many years to actually give me a few scares.Many of the scares are so memorable, because they are so well executed, they got the balance just right.Incredibly well acted, the performances are one of the film's best assets, but there are many besides.I'd have moved! It's a classic, 9/10."
"'Wan directed this based on true story about the Warrens, demonologists who try to help folks possessed get their lives back, involved in a big family\'s demonic problem after they move into a house where a witch hung herself while heralding the Devil.'"
"Something Borrowed is a brilliant laugh-out-loud comedy. I guarantee you'll laugh so hard your sides will hurt! I am in love with this movie! It is so hilarious I almost fell out of my set at the theater! The visual aspects of this film are great because of the crisp images and the dialogue is so funny. My favorite character is Ethan because he is so blunt and straight forward. There is no hiding his emotions and I laugh at almost every thing he says and does! Something that is so clever about this movie is that it is very emotional, so you can go from cracking up to crying in one scene.The only thing that really bothers me about this film is the ending. I do not think Dex and Claire should be together in the end, I mean, I know they wait for 6 years but it just doesn't sit right with me and I feel bad for how Claire and Darcy's relationship ended up.This movie is for ages 13 and up because teens and adults will love it for the hilarious adult humor and it is pretty inappropriate for children under 13.So if you're 13 and want to watch a fun film, go check it out. I loved it! Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic"
"Trick 'r Treat is written and directed by Michael Dougherty. It stars Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Anna Paquin and Brian Cox. Music is by Douglas Pipes and cinematography by Glen MacPherson. Trick 'r Treat plays out as an anthology of four Halloween related stories. One tiny figure with a burlap sack over its head links the film together.Warner Brothers kept it on the shelf for two years, a mistake since it happens to be a delightful little frightener that appears to be made with a love of omnibus shockers from back in the day. It's never overtly scary or bloody, but it has a twisted slickness that is rather pleasing in this day and age of poor horror remakes and boorish cash cow sequels. Neatly performed by the cast and with tech credits high from the camera folk, it homages simple horror pleasures as it celebrates Halloween. With a glint in its eye and a macabre smile on the lips, this non linear treat should be perennial viewing for the Halloween hordes. Especially since it rewards still further on repeat viewings. 8/10"
"The rituals of Halloween were devised to protect us from evil, and one small town is about to be taught a lesson that some traditions are best not forgotten.A suburban couple learn the dangers of blowing out a Jack-o-Lantern before midnight.Four women cross paths with a costumed stalker at a local festival, a group of pranksters goes too far and discovers the horrifying truth buried in a local legend, And finally, a cantankerous old hermit is visited by a strange trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.....It's a strange but brilliant anthology, this way underrated, and overlooked little gem.Imagine Joe Dante crossed with Leigh Whannel, and you have this movie which is more treat than trick.Usually with anthology movies, you have one slightly dud story, but here, they are all interwoven seamlessly, and the wealth of talent here only adds to the joy.While not necessarily scary, it's referential to the whole horror genre, but you wouldn't know this, because the references are so intricate, they are pretty hard to spot.The whole movie has a sort of childlike feel to it, almost like The Twilight Zone movie from 1983, this makes the flashes of gore more stark and noteworthy.All in all, it's a great movie to watch at this time of the year, as much as Home Alone is to watch at Christmas."
"'In order to control future rebellions remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four player must kill each other and survive in the wilderness and only one wins. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population.In the District 12, the teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a great hunter and eximious archer. When her younger sister Primrose Everdeen is selected as one of the representative of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they head by train to the Capital to be trained to the brutal game. Who will win The Hunger Games?The Hunger Games is an entertaining rip-off Battle Royale mixed with any film about totalitarian society, such as Logan\'s Run, 1984 or Brave New World.I was curious to see this film due to the hype surrounding it, but the plot is not original and I have seen this type of story before. It is quite impossible to recognize Elizabeth Banks travestied in her androgynous character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Jogos Vorazes (Voracious Games)'"
"I haven't watched this movie for such a long time because I am no fan of dramatic teen movies but it ended up being a pleasant surprise.The movie is 2h 22min long but it doesn't feel long. It is well paced and things keep on happening while the viewer keeps on being interested in what happens next.I liked how they made us like several character which made us wonder more what will happen at the end since only one can win. One group is made like really bad guys, maybe it would have been too much to make them all get empathy from viewer but I would have preferred it this way. They had reason to kill each other anyways.In some cases it is even surprising how often they spare her life or how she can nap without being attacked all the time. I just kept telling myself that characters are teenagers, they sometimes lack logic.And based on the title I assumed they will be hungry. Fight for food as well. There was nothing of it. It seemed like it took them 2-3 days for all those games and all that time they were well fed.The acting and characters are really good. Was great to see Wes Bentley in his character. I am sad he won't be in the next one. It is not a big part but he was just awesome in it."
"'I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book The Hunger Games or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!'"
"'Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) voluntarily takes her younger sister\'s place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete.Although I have not read the books, I understood the general themes the story was about. There are the games themselves, which seem to have been heavily influenced or inspired by Battle Royale. And then there is the political commentary on inequality -- whether this is a critique of Rome, America today or just this imaginary world is up to the viewer to decide.Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual, and it is nice to see Donald Sutherland in a small but important role. But overall I was actually a bit disappointed. For how hugely successful the books were, and how many people were excited for the movie, I did not find it to be anything really special. The plot is not all that creative and thought-provoking, despite the brilliant ideas they could have run with.Maybe the sequels will step it up with the bigger budget, but this opening attempt did not impress.'"
"'Small-time drug dealer Dave is forced to smuggle a large quantity of drugs into the USA from Mexico. In order to provide a convincing false identity by masquerading as a normal holidaying family in a camper van, he recruits stripper Rose as his wife, and homeless teen Casey and idiot neighbour Kenny as his children. The problem is that none of the four is ideally suited to playing the part of a normal family member and, when they get involved with another holidaying family whose Dad is a Drug Enforcement Agency operative, things get a little tricky.This film - which features a lot of bad language which may, or may not, have a bearing on your enjoyment, is morally questionable but quite likable nevertheless. There is some enjoyable dialogue, a good plot, nice character development arcs, and good playing by the principals, Will Poulter especially.I enjoyed this.'"
"A movie trying to prove that dysfunction may be the functional societal norm clearly runs out of steam as it progresses.When a drug dealer is hired to get drugs, he brings along people at random to make it appear that he is a family man. The group includes false wife Jennifer Aniston, a stripper, a run-away daughter to serve as his daughter and a neighbor's son, who has been abandoned by his mother.The film is devoted to the adventures of the group trying to get the drugs. This proves to be far more dangerous than they had ever imagined. Meetings include seeing a supposedly conventional family with the wife having lesbian like tendencies.It is interesting in that along the way, this group actually starts to act like a family, in caring for one another."
"'I just saw Gone Girl tonight. However, by now this will be the 880th review, so I will try to be very brief. After all, just about everything that can be said about the film probably has. Suffice to say I liked the film but think its extremely high rating on IMDb is perhaps a bit higher than I\'d rate it. It\'s good...but I can\'t see it as the 140th best film of all time. So what did I like? Well, the Nancy Grace-like \'journalist\', Ellen Abbott, was terrific and I am happy about anything that makes Ms. Grace look bad. I also liked most of the acting. I actually thought Ben Afleck was really good. The plot also reminded me a lot of a great old film Leave Her to Heaven. But I also felt the film was too graphic--too bloody and too much nudity for me to let a kid or teen or even more see the film. Overall, an impressive film but not among my favorites of 2014.'"
The premise of a one week break from married life is the story for Hall Pass. The Brothers take a shot married life and succeed. There are many laugh out loud moments almost throughout the movie. It is really the Brothers best in a while. Put it after Something About Mary and Shallow Hal. There is a satisfying story always a moral. It's risquÃ© without being crude even though there is some toilet humor. Also it's never painful to watch. Jokes are fresh and even though you can guess the outcome it's just really enjoyable to see how you get there. It's one of those comedies that is funny even if you watch it a second time because there are so many good lines.With this cast you can't go wrong. Owen is always charmingly droll. He even has a middle aged spread to boot. His awkward dance and pickup moves are endearing. Sudekis is a bit common looking but he's good for the part. Applegate is spot on. She really needs to get more big screen comedic roles - she is so good and very pretty. Fisher is a bit laid back but suitable. There are some familiar Farrelly Bros supporting cast. Some new faces like the Aussie temptation and the babysitter are great too.The visit The Shallow Hal like part in the bar with Richard Jenkins is hilarious. The visit to the new house of their friend is good to.Worth watching - ignore the bad reviews.
"HALL PASS (2011) *** Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Jenna Fischer, Christina Applegate, Nicky Whelan, Stephen Merchant, Larry Joe Campbell, JB Smoove, Joy Behar, Richard Jenkins, Kathy Griffin (cameo as herself). The Farrely Brothers are back to true-form in this frequently hilarious comedy about two married buddies (Wilson & Sudeikis having a field day) who are given a quasi 'diplomatic immunity' for a week from their wives (Fischer & Applegate) to endure the titular rite of passage with atypical mix of heart and raunch in the mix from the sibling filmmakers (who collaborated on the script with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett). Best bit â stay for the closing credits for Merchant's pausing to contemplate his wife's suggestion to follow suit."
"'this film is the perfect answer. for the memorable scenes. for the impeccable way of revenge. for the great performances. and for many others small details who are axis of a film who represents just a trip of the viewer in the heart of the director universe. at first sigh - nothing new. or surprising. or unpredictable. at the second - a clock mechanism who remains impressive again and again. because, like each film by him, Django Unchained is a homage to the masters. like each of his films, it is a splendid demonstration of action, irony and the perfect cast. and this does Tarantino to be himself. in each occasion. because it is not only a lesson of cinema. but a travel across the cinematography history. so, nothing special from him.'"
"'Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they\'re supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth\'s Knock Knock is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of Grindhouse (Tarantino\'s collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the \'70s), and then co-starred in Inglourious Basterds as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of Citizen Kane and Dr. Strangelove. If Knock Knock is any indication, Roth\'s own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.'"
"'To define it ? Profound dark is more than fine. Bloody ? Off course! But, more significant, example of high cinematography. And admirable storytelling. And not bad acting. A story dynamic and far to be comfortable and pure exces of CGI. But the result is more than the blockbuster who you expect or the modern version of the version of 80 s. It is a story about loneliness , fall of dictatorship and splendid occasion to see Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult and Tom Hardy at work, in a film as large puzzle of memories about different influences. So, just great.'"
"'A sarcastic teen rom com that ticks all the boxes. The leads have great chemistry and the characters had depth. Although the plot was wildly predictable, you want it all to happen. Kind of lovely and adorable.'"
"'This film tells the story of a teenage girl who isn\'t as beautiful as her best friends. She is called a designated ugly fat friend, and her quest to change herself is started.I love high school movies, because they are always fun to watch. In The DUFF, the plot is predictable but is very funny. I laughed out loud so many times, especially the scene where Bianca goes on a date with Toby. The scene outside the library about unfriending each other us hilarious as well, but i cab totally see it happening in real life. The positive message within the film is prominent and infectious, and it makes me feel more positive and happy! I really enjoyed watching this film.'"
"This film tells the story of a retired assassin who is forced out of hiding by a gangster's son who doesn't know who he is messing with.I watched the sequel first then this film, and I think this film is more realistic than the sequel. At least in here John Wick gets hurt! It is stylish and is fun to watch."
"I will say up front I know nothing about Captain America, nothing about Marvel Comics, and I'm not a connoisseur of special effects.That all being said, Captain America was highly entertaining.Chris Evans is the scrawny Steve Rogers, who, after trying without fail to get into World War II, is chosen by a scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) for an experiment called Project Rebirth. Steve is transformed into the superhuman to create the all-powerful man, who becomes Captain America. Dr. Erskine is assassinated by a HYDRA agent - HYDRA being the Nazi secret research.Initially Rogers is misused, sent out to sell war bonds. However, he abandons this when his good friend Bucky and his unit are caught behind enemy lines. Then he finally gets into the war as he has always wanted.Great cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough, and Samuel L. Jackson.I really liked the effects, although I gather some people thought they weren't that good. What I liked the most was the old-fashioned ambiance, which was very well done.Enjoyable."
"'This film tells the story of a young man who is not physically fit enough to be in the Army. He is selected for a special program to transform him into a superhero that will save the United States of America.Captain America The First Avenger is quite unlike other superhero blockbusters. It starts off slow, detailing how he was bullied on the streets of Brooklyn and then in the Army training base. He is finally transformed into a superhero after one hour of screen time, which is pretty long and slow if you ask me. Then, the plot is rather unfocused, as it tells the fight between USA and Nazi Germany, and also the fight between Rogers and the bad red guy. I find the plot so unfocused that I lost interest in it altogether. It is not packed with action enough, not packed with enough thrills or excitement. Though I am a little disappointed, I think I will still watch the sequel to see if it gets any better.'"

"'Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a smallish, frail young man born during the Great Depression, that is captivated and outraged by the newsreels of the war in Europe. Steve is so inspired that he tries to join the army, but is turned down because of his physicality and wellness. Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) overhears the young man\'s dejection filled pleas and offers a chance to serve his country. Colonel Phillips wants Rogers to take part in an experiment that will leave him with a perfect body fit for tactical and physical training. Within months, Steve Rogers will emerge a perfectly remade man and will become a national avenger dubbed...Captain America.You can only be impressed with the story line, the awesome cinematography and top shelf special effects. Plenty of drama and action that will let the viewer leave with pride and amazement.Outstanding cast featuring: Samuel L. Jackson, Stanley Tucci, Hayley Atwell, Hugo Weaving, Dominic Cooper, Toby Jones, Sebastian Stan and Richard Armitage.'"
"'Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protÃ©gÃ©e of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other rat.The Departed is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even Donnie Brasco is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichÃ©s and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Os Infiltrados (The Infiltrated)'"
"'Tim Burton presents his dark, but comedic style in stop-motion animation. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS(1993) was a critical and theatrical success; and this black comedy is just as much fun to watch. The visuals are just outstanding; beauty comes in many forms. Victor(Johnny Depp)lives in a small 19th century European village, where the shy groom-to-be rehearses his wedding to Victoria(Emily Watson)and meets a beautiful, but deceased young corpse bride(Helena Bonham Carter),fresh from the grave; who actually is under the impression she has just married him.Other voices you may or may not recognize: Christopher Lee, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, Paul Whithouse, Jane Horrocks and Danny Elfman, who also provides the undeniably great soundtrack.'"
"This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.Overall, an inventive film and fun to watch once you get past the slow first part."
"'The second animated feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993\'s THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot\'s perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I\'d say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn\'t lessen in any way the latter\'s remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.'"
"'There\'s a couple of things to say about Tim Burton\'s Corpse Bride. It\'s an impressive achievement in stop-motion animation, and the voices fit the characters perfectly. But I\'d say that what\'s more important is what it says about the class structure in 1800s Europe. Set in an unidentified village - it could be anywhere in Europe, despite the English accents - there\'s an arranged marriage planned between the son of a nouveau riche couple and the daughter of cruel aristocrats. It turns out, after the son gets whisked away to the Land of the Dead, that this place is livelier than the alive place. There can be no doubt that the nice world of the aristocrats was a facade (it\'s worth noting that Johnny Depp also played James M. Barrie, whose Peter Pan constituted a rebellion against the world of the aristocrats).So I\'d say that\'s that movie\'s real strength. It has a creative plot, but the indictment of the aristocracy is the important thing. Along with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Alfred in the 1989-97 Batman movies) do a fine job with the voices. I recommend it.As for Burton\'s disliked 2012 adaptation of Dark Shadows, I interpreted it as a look at the political situation in the early 1970s.'"
"'Pleasant romantic comedy about a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who is told by his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time. He proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl (Rachel McAdams). As a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments, it\'s very enjoyable and nice. As science fiction, it will give you headaches with all the plot holes. So the more unforgiving sci-fi fans out there might want to skip this one. I didn\'t mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along. The plot itself is reminiscent of Groundhog Day and maybe a little bit of Somewhere in Time. Gleeson and McAdams both do very well and have great chemistry. McAdams is especially likable. Gleeson has an appealing young Hugh Grant quality about him. Bill Nighy steals the show from everybody, as is often the case. It\'s a good movie if you don\'t think too hard about it. But I must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories, you will really hate this. Everybody who doesn\'t fit that description should definitely check it out.'"
"'This film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time. He embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriend.Though the main character is a guy, it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women. The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It\'s almost like The Notebook plus The Time Traveler\'s Wife combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there\'s much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don\'t make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it\'s a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn\'t the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it\'s still an enjoyable film.'"
"College student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) interviews young millionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). He becomes obsessed with her and she starts falling for him. However he has control issues and is into BDSM. Can she deal with that? Ignore all the controversy about this. In many ways this is just another romantic drama about a couple dealing with issues--those issues just happen to be BDSM and control. It has all the romantic meetings, the nonstop love songs on the soundtrack and some fairly explicit (but tasteful) sex. The BDSM is confined to just two scenes and it's not that bad. There is nudity but almost all of it is from Johnson. Dornan just bares his butt three times and that's it. It seems kind of strange that a movie targeted at women has so little male nudity. It's also well-directed and is more or less interesting. However it goes on for too long and keeps repeating itself. Also the character of Mr. Grey comes across as more than a little creepy. The acting varies. Johnson is very good in her role. Dornan is ridiculously handsome and all pumped up but lacks the charisma that his character should have. All in all a pretty good romantic drama."

"GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fun and light-hearted superhero romp from Marvel. The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first, featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical, world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects, which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt, nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine, but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun, while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing, and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable, and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later, but the camaraderie is good-natured and, more importantly, funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum, and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel."
"'When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it\'s funniest moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which does have some similarities to the movie Very Bad Things, but does not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successful.The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active) role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he can display his comedic potential more than in He\'s not that into you. Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I\'ve seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don\'t watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don\'t know what\'s gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it\'s all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don\'t know what they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I\'d love to see one! :o)'"
"'In Terrel, the veteran from Vietnam and retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) accidentally finds many trucks and a gang of drug dealers dead while hunting in the desert. Moss discovers also a wallet with two million dollars and decides to bring it home and not report his finding to the police. Meanwhile the owners of the money assign the psychopath killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to chase Moss following the transponder in the wallet and leaving a trail of murders. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), from the third generation of a family of men-of-law, investigates the crimes while questions the momentum of violence of his country.No Country for Old Men is a pretentious and overrated movie of Ethan and Joel Cohen. The authors blended the old story lines of Sam Raimi\'s A Simple Plan with Robert Harmon\'s The Hitcher plus some cheap philosophy to write this story. The result is not bad at all, with good performances and an unrecognizable Javier Bardem in the role of a psychopath killer. Unfortunately the story fails with its inconclusive conclusion. Surprisingly this average movie is ranked Top 250 # 79 in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Onde os Fracos NÃ£o Tem Vez (Where the Weaks do not Have Chance)'"
"'This film is about a woman waking up from sleep to different puzzling events concerning her husband\'s life.I must say that the plot is excellent. It is difficult to put together a plot that involves intertwining present and future, and not to have any plot holes. Sandra Bullock\'s previous film, The Lake House, was full of such plot holes. In contrast, the plot of Premonition is sound and has no plot holes. The present and future interacts with each other so that every piece of information has significance in the future. What\'s more important is that the outcome makes sense and not contradict each other. The initial confusion of Sandra Bullock is well presented, and I sympathise with her strange experience. The suspense is excellent and maintained throughout the movie. Things are revealed bit by bit, and finally everything falls into place. The ending is the best bit, but I will not reveal it. This film really captivated me, and I definitely recommend it!'"
"Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police. He bought her a truck from Billy Black and befriends Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) but he goes to school in the reservation. She makes a few new friends but is more intrigue by the Cullens especially Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward can't seem to stand her at first. Then he saves her with his supernatural powers. There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson. They are good actors and it's not that bad as far as overwrought teen melodrama is concerned. They are teenage star-crossed lovers and there's no shame in that."
"Wes Anderson had made a delightful offbeat art house film that never outstays its hospitality. It has a stamp of an assured filmmaker, confident of his eccentric style.Mr Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) his tale of the now faded Grand Budapest Hotel over dinner.In 1932, the Grand Budapest Hotel was epitome of decadent and luxury somewhere in Eastern Europe. Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a refugee started out as a newly hired lobby boy. He is taken under the wing of the eccentric concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes.)Gustave in effect runs the hotel and attends to the personal needs to some of the older ladies who stay in the hotel such as Madame D (Tilda Swinton.) When she dies, Gustave is bequeathed a valuable painting. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is far from pleased with this. Gustave is accused of the old lady's murder and Dmitri's henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) makes sure any irritant is disposed off quickly.Wes Anderson has directed a whimsical and absurd black comedy with a camp performance from Fiennes that has a startling odour. It was a shame that he was not Oscar nominated. There are cameos from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Edward Norton. The story can get dark and murderous at times, it has an underlying sadness. You see proto fascists who demand to see papers of all the travellers on a train. Enough to parallel the real world of the 1930s."

"'If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback. Depending on what your viewing behavior is, you\'ll either enjoy the really out there feeling of this or you won\'t. Normally I\'d think I\'m not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it\'s not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it\'s the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the tension high. If you\'re not sure watch the trailer, if it is appealing watch, otherwise don\'t waste your time'"
"This film is about the spontaneous holidays that 2 women arranged after being hurt by their respective love.Due to the nature of the film, it involves the romances of 2 couples. It is more like 2 parallel love stories in one film, which explains the length of this film. Fortunately, the transition between the two stories is smooth and clear. Cameron Diaz is excellent in her portrayal of her character. She can really act! Kate Winslet's expression of joy and surprise when she first arrived at her house in Los Angeles is memorable.The story is predictable, but it is entertaining anyway. The fact that Kate Winslet's character derived pleasure ans satisfaction through helping others contrasted with Cameron Diaz's character. This contrast s well done and well planned, as having 2 identical love stories would be boring."
"The Holiday (2006): Dir: Nancy Meyers / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, Eli Wallach: Feel-good romantic comedy about escaping emotional stress and embracing new challenges and successes. Cameron Diaz plays a Hollywood producer who just ended a bad relationship. Kate Winslet learns at an office Christmas party that the guy she always fancied is engaged. Crushed, both women decide to swap houses for the holiday. Directed by Nancy Meyers who made a film of similar nature called Something's Gotta Give where two opposites end up sharing space. Here she goes beyond typical clichÃ©s and creates two subplots that contain surprise developments such as the fact that Law has two special girls in his life. Diaz and Winslet are perfectly matched and play off the humour well. Jude Law plays Winslet's brother whom romances Diaz thus arising certain questions. Jack Black turns up and strikes up a friendship with Winslet and shares his love for music and movie scores. Eli Wallach makes an appearance as an aged Hollywood screenwriter whom Winslet befriends. While some elements are predictable, such as its turn out, it is still entertaining with many funny moments. It is easily one of Nancy Meyers's best films in a long line of romantic comedies. It stresses the need to get away from stress and seek new opportunities. Score: 9 / 10"

"'In 1954, the Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) from Seattle travel by ferry to the Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of the patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who drowned her three kids, from the mental institution for dangerous criminals Ashcliffe Hospital. Teddy is veteran WWII soldier traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm, Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees, discovers that one is missing and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the sixty-seventh patient of the Shutter Island. Shutter Island is a good but predictable psychological thriller. The production has a high budget and consequently a great cast, costumes, locations and special effects. However, the major twist when Teddy Daniels finds the truth about the Shutter Island and himself is not a surprise. In this regard, Identity and Haute Tension for example, work better and better and really surprise the viewer after the plot point. Further, the IMDb Rating Top 250: #246 is absolutely overrated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Ilha do Medo (Island of the Fear)'"
"'In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in The Prestige. It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan\'s others. There\'s the non-linear plot, like Memento; one-upmanship, like Insomnia; the question of morality, like in The Dark Knight. But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier\'s and Borden\'s rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla\'s (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It\'s both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are The Illusionist and Scoop (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).'"
"'Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.As two magicians, one\'s mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman\'s wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show The Nanny. Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don\'t run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening.'"
"'Vladislav, Viago, Deacon, and Petyr (Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, Jonathan Brugh, and Ben Fransham) are flatmates. Oh, and they\'re also vampires.Filmed by a documentary crew, our nocturnal friends go through their nightly routines. Their personalities are quite different, which makes them more interesting. Vladislav is the Dracula-type (Think: Vlad The Impaler), looking and sounding very Transylvanian. Viago is more of a gentle sort, not wanting to cause problems. He was a dandy when he was alive. Deacon is the more cool, hip bloodsucker. If Keith Moon had become a vampire, this is what he would be! He knits his own sweaters as well. Petyr is the classic Nosferatu of the group, sealed in his concrete coffin in the cellar.As we watch these undead, they take us along on a dark journey into... hilarity! WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the best mockumentaries since THIS IS SPINAL TAP. As interesting as it is uproarious, it\'s certainly better than any real reality TV show.Some highlights include: Group discussions about the household chores, encounters with the local werewolf pack, the human incident at The Unholy Masquerade, and many more!For lovers of humor, who happen to like vampires too. The perfect Halloween confection!...'"
"'Let me start with: I don\'t like reality TV at all. And there is a reason you have to put , because it is anything but real. And while this isn\'t real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least at home. And it shows, because of the chemistry they have. This is very well written and acted. Comedy timing is essential and in this case awesome.'"
"After hearing so many good reports about this movie - and remembering that New Zealand has made some really funny offbeat comedies (like the early works of Peter Jackson) - I decided to give it a look. And for the most part, I am glad I gave it a chance. It is indeed very amusing at times. I think that the reason the movie is humorous is that it has a very warm viewpoint towards the characters. Yes, some of the acting is a little rough, but these characters come across as HUMAN despite being vampires. They have needs, they have weaknesses, and other attributes that we in the audience can identify with. You'll like them despite their blood sucking. Speaking of blood sucking, the gore and the special effects are quite good for what had to have been a really low budget.If there is a weakness to this movie, it is in the story department. I realize the movie is a mockumentary following the characters in a day by day format (or make that night by night!), but for the longest time the movie is pretty episodic. After a while, you'll wish for some plot to come in to challenge the characters and add in some real drama. This lack of plot I believe holds the movie back from being great. But there's still enough here to make for a very enjoyable viewing."
"Clever director David Fincher adapts Swede Stieg Larsson's novel, the first of a trilogy of chillers. A disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig), accepts a job writing a biography of a wealthy industrialist; but actually is hired to solve the mystery of the patriarch's niece's disappearance...40 years ago. Most of the family live scattered on a small island and very few speak to each other, if at all. Mikeal will need the aid of bi-sexual, tattooed, punk computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander(Rooney Mara). It is very hard to keep a good girl down and this job will require every talent she has. The journalist and hacker work outstandingly well together. Their investigation will involve looking at decades of business records and analyzing old photos. The pair will uncover massive corruption and family portrayals like you couldn't believe. Secrets die hard. Some scenery is high maintenance; and some of my favorite scenes involve snowy landscapes. The violence does not necessarily pack a punch; but the sex scenes leave very little to the imagination. You will be eager in waiting for the second and third installments. Rounding out the cast: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson and Geraldine James."
"David Fincher is able to recreate the first of the Swedish hit trilogy based on the novels. The style is similar with the Swedish original. It's got the cold blue tone, and the same desolate morality. It hasn't been transplanted to anywhere else. In fact, it's basically kept the whole thing intact with the exception of the actors. Daniel Craig is a Hollywood choice to be the journalist. Of course, he's 007. Sure he's hot. So when Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) sleeps with him, it is less about his personality and a little more about his James Bond body. But it's to be expected for a Hollywood remake. Rooney Mara is just not as intense as Noomi Rapace. Rooney is a skinny girly actress with some good acting skills. She has just enough to play the anger. But Noomi has more. The original Lisbeth was a true discovery.I hate to compare the two, but they are so close that they're begging to be compared. Overall I liked the Swedish one slightly more but just very slightly. Some of that probably is due to the fact that I saw that one first. David Fincher does a great job of recreating the original."
"'So after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax with this eighth film.All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the wizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved characters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection. Radcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at times. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a fantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed in this film.Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes nothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when reading the book but by and large the director David Yates has constructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that these films will long live on in the memory.'"
"'J. K. Simmons has played a number of stern, demanding characters during his career. But he gets the role of a lifetime in Damien Chazelle\'s Whiplash. He plays the brutal instructor of a college jazz band. This man resorts to methods that lapse into abuse. In showing these overly aggressive teaching methods, the movie poses the question of what is the right thing to do when encouraging students to succeed. Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance. Although it was for Best Supporting Actor, the movie belongs to him. Miles Teller\'s performance as the student is truly secondary to Simmons. His character is one of only a few movie characters in history who made me feel as if I was walking on eggshells.'"
"An enthralling story, set against the backdrop of a prestigious music school. It covers one young man's attempts to reach the top of the musical industry, and the band leader who may be his ticket, or his nemesis.A deeply psychological drama, it explores issues like ambition, obsession and power.Has a few interesting twists too, especially towards the end.Not perfect: some of the twists aren't consistent, character-wise. The final scene overplays the conclusion and is too neat in some ways. Despite this, it missed having a final word on one or two of the themes, leaving these as secondary considerations in favour of a more Hollywoodesque ending.Decent performance by Miles Teller in the lead role. Superb performance by JK Simmons as Fletcher, the band leader. He well deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for a performance that is searingly intense and perfect for the character."
"Chris Hemsworth, Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, Jesse Williams, and Fran Kranz are five college friends who head off for a weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods. It's a simple classic horror setup. What follows is a series horror classic discoveries, and finally the shocking truth.Director Drew Goddard co-writes with Joss Whedon as they bring a smart spin on the traditional horror. It's easy to see how this is the work of movie fans. They definitely know the horror genre. Chris Hemsworth is proving his movie hunk status. This is best described as a mastercrafted movie."
"'This film is about how Clark Kent grew up on Earth, and how he battles with the evil General from Krypton to save the Earth.Man of Steel completely blew me away. Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It\'s easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe\'s integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams\' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill\'s superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing. It\'s such a powerful film that never ceases to amaze and inspire awe.'"
"'I heard this film is good, and it certainly impressed me! The special effects are amazing. The action scenes are so fast paced that it is sometimes hard to keep track of everything that is happening. The scenes are so well made that everything looks completely real. I particularly like how the sand moves to create the sandman. Every detail is portrayed in the film! The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching! I really liked the ending. I think the final scene could have been cut away for better pacing, but maybe for some it is necessary.'"
"'There aren\'t many moments in the movie that aren\'t intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I\'m not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in The Passion of the Christ and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One\'s attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man\'s perseverance, exemplified by Glass\'s own words in my summary line above.'"
"Several weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio won his Best Actor Oscar for this movie, I finally got to see The Revenant with my movie theatre-working friend (who had watched this previously a few weeks ago) just now. DiCaprio played Hugh Glass, a trapper who was left for dead from several men including Tom Hardy as John Fitzgerald, who is revealed to be quite selfish most of the time. Hardy also gave a fine performance that also got him an Oscar nomination though he lost to Mark Ryland in The Bridge of Spies. Anyway, the nature shots taking place in winter look rough most of the time, appropriately so, so to speak. Oh, and that sequence involving that bear looked really brutal, that's for sure! So on that note, I definitely recommend The Revenant unless that bear sequence makes you squeamish..."
"Awesome, terrific, epic, gruesome, this is the hell of a movie, where Dick Sarafian's MAN IN THE WILDERNESS would meet Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, in the style and directing scheme I mean. I understand though that most people don't like it. yes, you are shocked by viewing such a masterpiece, and the bear fight is absolutely unforgettable, but I don't think any one on earth could survive after such an assault. But the CGI effects are one hundred percent efficient."
"First off, I have to admit, that I haven't seen the original Charlie & the Chocolate movie. So I won't be able to compare the movies with each other. But I can tell you that this is a nice little kids movie, that you've got here. Johnny Depp, a Tim Burton regular, plays his role with much gusto.But the kids are great, too. Not to mention the squirrels or Charlie's helpers, who are also great. But it's all too neat and as an adult and/or as a frequent movie goer, you'll know where this is going. No surprise there, but still plenty of fun to be had, if you let the movie have an effect on you. Also noteworthy, Burtons wife is also in this movie, as in his other efforts, too and the really great Christopher Lee has a small, but significant role to play here too!"
"'The eccentric manufacturer of chocolates and candies Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) promotes a tour through his chocolate factory, the greatest in the world, through five golden tickets hidden in the bars of chocolate. The poor and sweet boy Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) finds one, for the pride and joy of his very supportive family, and he spends the day in a mysterious competition for an unknown award with other four nasty boys and girls.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a delightful and delicious adventure through the world of the fantasy. Tim Burton changes his usual morbid scenarios to very bright ones, and keeps the usual very weird character, magnificently performed by the awesome Johnny Depp. This movie is highly indicated for the whole family and it is an excellent entertainment. Unfortunately I have not had the chance to watch the original 1971 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory to make a comparison, but this remake is really a great movie. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): A FantÃ¡stica FÃ¡brica de Chocolates (The Fantastic Factory of Chocolates)'"
"Director Matthew Vaughn continues His Winning Streak with this Ultra-Violent Send-Up of the Slick Spy Movie. The Movie is so Sleek, Stylish, and Outrageous it is likely to Cause Spontaneous Orgasim among Teenagers and Hyper-Actives of all ages.All the Money spent on this Glorious, Gory, Goof is up there On the Screen. It Razzles and Dazzles in almost Every Scene. The Writing is Smart and Reverentially Reflective as the Tone Fluctuates between Irreverence and Irresponsibility.But a Good Time can be had by Those Willing to Allow for some Gut-Wrenching Displays of Murderous Mayhem and not so easy to take Comedy, like Our Hero's Reward for Saving the World that Ends this Exhausting Entertainment. That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance. Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before. The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.Recommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. as it Parodies he Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control. Behold...This is Art Imitating Life with a Swagger and a Smirk."
"'This film tells the story of a young man who is selected to be in training to work for a private run secret agent service.Kingsman: The Secret Service is really a lot of fun. The graphic violence is so over the top that it becomes funny. The fireworks scene makes me laugh out loud! I like the characters in the film, I think Colin Firth is very convincing as a gentleman and secret agent. His protÃ©gÃ© is good as well, he transforms from a street kid to a gentleman with killer instincts. The numerous action scenes are very imaginative, they even have balloons going up into space, which is quite unexpected. I enjoyed watching this film.'"
"KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.The story is ludicrous and a deliberate throwback to '60s cinema. Samuel L. Jackson hams it up a storm as the baddie while it's fun to see Colin Firth playing something other than the slightly stuff romantic figure he always reverts to. Where KINGSMAN excels is in the violent action scenes, which play up brief snippets of outrageousness and feature far better choreography than expected. The church fight is the undoubted highlight, but the large-scale action of the climax is well staged too. CGI is used extensively, but works for the most part. I may not be running out to see the sequel anytime soon, but I'll definitely give it a watch at some point."

"'after you read the novel, after you see the adaptations, it is the basic question. because each adaptation propose the vision of director and the novel is almost perfect. so, reading it is enough. but... the virtue, basic virtue of this film is far to be the best adaptation. but it is courageous, inspired and useful. because Mr. Darcy by Matthew Macfadyen is not exactly the ice man, his delicacy, vulnerable actions being a seductive surprise. Keira Knightley has the gift to be , more you expect, Elisabeth. like Rosamund Pike, who does an admirable Jane. the flavor of novel. this is the gift of this honest, inspired and profound beautiful adaptation. but the motif to see it is, maybe, the feeling after its end. who seems be, maybe only in my case, like the old feeling after I finish the book.'"
"'This film tells the story of a man trapped with his wife and child, yet he keeps on thinking about his ex-girlfriend who is not contactable. The story then winds back in time to tell how his relationships with his ex-girlfriend and his wife come about.I have heard about the gratuitous explicit sex scenes in the film, and indeed there is a prolonged sex scene every five minutes. The story is quite interesting, as the man reflects and reminisces about Elektra, who is so adventurous that she becomes increasingly unstable. The problems encountered by the man are quite real life, and viewers can easily relate to his situation. What strikes me is that the lighting effects of the film is very remarkable, the use of focused lighting enhances the mood a lot. The slow strobe effect in the swingers\' club is captivating. Overall, Love is worth a watch as it depicts real life relationship problems.'"
"While far less engaging than other Gaspar NoÃ© movies, Love explores the love life of its very unlikeable protagonist with all the stylish editing, beautiful cinematography and explicit sex you would expect from him.It's almost impossible to feel any sympathy for its main character, but his story was still mostly interesting to watch. The sex scenes tie together an okay drama elevated by NoÃ©'s unique style.Artistically and technically impressive, though aside from its unsimulated sex scenes and some trippy sequences, doesn't offer the type of out-of-body experience that most NoÃ© fans would expect."
"Ethan Hawke is crime writer Ellison Oswalt. It's been 10 years since his breakout hit. He has moved his whole family into a murder house intending to write his new book on. The old family had all been hung in the old tree in the backyard, but the family's young daughter went missing. Strange things keep happening in the house. For example, he finds some 8mm snuff films in the attic, and discover there may be other related murders.Ethan Hawke is rock solid in driving this movie. This is all his movie. The atmosphere is amazing. If there's anything they desperately needed, it's some better supporting characters. The wife, the kids, the bumpkin young cop, they are all stock characters done by unknown actors. There're no standouts in those areas. The movie works from the creepy atmosphere that builds and builds."
"'This is the first horror film I\'ve seen for ages that actually sent the occasional shiver down my spine. I\'m not quite sure why it\'s been re-released onto the big screen late in 2020, but I\'m glad I made the effort. Ethan Hawke (Ellison Oswalt) made his name ten years earlier as an author who wrote a book Kentucky Blood which dealt with the murder of an entire family and uncovered evidence overlooked by the police - much to their chagrin! Ever since, though, he has never managed to replicate his success and so now, together with wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and their two kids, takes up residence in a bungalow that was previously owned by a family found hanged from the bough of a tree in their own garden. Now, I don\'t know about you - but that would probably have been my cue to skedaddle, but he perseveres and when he discovers some really intriguing home movies in the attic, then starts hearing things go bump in the night the mystery deepens as does his dependence on the whisky bottle. Scott Derrickson uses light and sound eerily well and manages to create a genuine and ascending sense of peril here; Hawke is on form and as we gradually see the pattern emerging - with the help of the seemingly dozy, but actually pretty savvy local deputy James Ransone - the film gathers quite a decent pace to it. I liked the ending too...'"
"'I adore Henry Selick\'s The Nightmare Before Christmas and its ghoulish sense of humor, so I was prepared for more of the same in Coraline. But what I didn\'t expect was that this film would be so delightfully disturbing and so utterly sophisticated. For anyone who wants an antidote to the typical Disney-fied children\'s fare available to you (and even the Pixar films aren\'t excluded from that description), Coraline is for you.Coraline is like a David Lynch film for kids. Like Lynch films, it seems to exist in a universe of its own, where an entirely different set of logic applies. The imagery in the film can be quite frightening at times, but it\'s also quite beautiful in its own way. And the film\'s ultimate message -- that kids need to accept the imperfections of their parents and stop moping about an adult world they don\'t entirely understand -- is a very grown up one.A marvelous animated film.Grade: A'"
"'CORALINE (2009) **** (Voices of: Dakota Fanning, Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn Fanning, Robert Bailey, Jr., Ian McShane, Keith David.) Excellent stop-motion animated film adaptation of Neil Gaimon\'s book by wunderkind filmmaker Henry Selick about a young girl named Coraline (Fanning) whose seemingly unhappiness with her family discovers a doorway into a parallel world where she finds an Other Mother and Father, and realizes the motto of \'be careful what you wish for\' as a golden rule. Filled with phantasmagoric elements of fantasy not unlike Alice In Wonderland but with a slightly darker edge and spookiness but a truly remarkable display of an art form that is rarely given its props and Selick and his team of magicians create an amazingly incredible tour-de-force of painstaking artistry to behold. One of the year\'s very best.'"
"Adapted from Neil Gaimon's book, comes Coraline, a truly wonderful animated film with lots going for it. The atmosphere was wonderful, people may find it too dark, but I for one loved how dark it was. And of course the visuals are absolutely exquisite, I loved the backgrounds, character designs and the darkly bold colours. The music is nice and quirky while having an appropriate atmosphere, while the script is intelligent and well balanced and the story is well paced and compelling with very few dull moments. The characters are great, I love Coraline especially because she is very inquisitive, and I like that in a protagonist, and the voice acting is superb especially from Dakota Fanning and Keith David. Overall, loved the atmosphere, loved the visuals, loved the flick. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"'This film tells the true story of a bunch of people who saw what no one else in Wall Street saw. They trade accordingly, betting against the American economy. However, their profits come at a very high price to the American public.The Big Short has three separate story lines, as three different groups of people bet against the banks. I find that slightly confusing at first, and that is not helped by the complicated financial jargon. Fortunately, they do explain the jargon well, using entertaining dialogs by cameo actresses. The three separate story lines make the film very realistic, but I find it less engaging and captivating than other financial crisis films. However, it is one of the few financial crisis films that touch on the disastrous impact on the public, which is a nice touch.'"
"We are such a fragile race, so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze. A child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves. So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel."
"It's 1935 England. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) is an imaginative writer who witnesses her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and servant's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Robbie is thinking about going to medical school with her father's help. Briony has a crush on Robbie. When cousin Lola Quincey gets raped, Briony's false accusation sends Robbie to prison. Four years later, Robbie is in France retreating towards Dunkirk. He has been released from prison to join the Army. Cecilia cannot forgive Briony (Romola Garai) who has abandoned Cambridge to do something useful as a nurse. Briony is haunted by her mistake as she writes her story.This is beautifully shot and acted. It's worthwhile for multiple viewings. There are epic scenes like Dunkirk and memorably constructed ones like the fountain. It can be slow at times but it's never tired. The biggest change I would add is the important rape scene. I think it's important to show the man's identity to the audience. Here's the thing. It's not a needed mystery except for Briony. It's obviously not Robbie but it would be more intense to know for sure."
"'In New York, the twenty-eight year-old Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a dedicated and perfectionist ballerina of the ballet company that lives with her controller mother and former ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey). The director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to renovate the company for the next season that will open with the Swan Lake with a new face and retires the prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder). Nina is his first option to perform The Swan Queen, perfect for the role of the White Swan, but too restrained to perform the Black Swan. Nina feels threatened by the newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis), who can perfectly perform the Black Swan, and is stressed with the situation. When Nina has a nervous breakdown, she gets in contact with her dark side and has constant nightmarish daydreams.Black Swan is a beautiful but predictable film of Darren Aronofsky, with a cinematography that gives a nightmarish environment to the story that is too dark for a drama and too dramatic for a horror movie. Natalie Portman has a great performance but her character is too naive and with lack of confidence for a New Yorker indicated to be the prima ballerina of a ballet company. The theme is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the case of split personality but the film does not justify the hype around it. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Cisne Negro (Black Swan)'"
"'Remember when Ronald Colman copped an Oscar for going berserk as a Shakespearian actor in 1947\'s A Double Life? Natalie Portman is about to do the same as a ballerina going off the wall in Black Swan.The ballet scene, especially the showing of Swan Lake is beautifully staged. Did anyone see the similarity between her Natalie\'s movie mother and Anne Bancroft in The Turning Point? Both gave up ballerina careers to pursue families. Of course, this \'Swan\' is certainly no \'Turning Point\' either.As the conflicted ballet star, Portman turns in a credible performance which will probably be honored on Oscar night, Feb. 27th.As viewers, we are ourselves conflicted. What did ballet director, an excellent Vincent Cassel, and fellow ballerina and rival, Mila Kunis both do to add to Portman\'s madness? Kunis, at the beginning of the film, acts as though she is a young tough right out of the gangs in West Side Story. Cassel, as the driving choreographer, is excellent in the role.Portman\'s downhill descent into madness occurs too quickly. True, that Cassel wanted her to be more devilish in the twin role of the evil Black Swan. It\'s as if Portman has become the Norma Desmond of ballet. She was certainly ready for her final take, no matter how tragic that was.'"
"Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche."
"'Knowing only that this movie was about an aspiring ballerina vying for a role in Swan Lake, I wasn\'t prepared for a largely dark tale about said ballerina\'s severe issues with inferiority and the self mutilation that came from the challenge of competition. That theme was further reinforced by the dancer she replaced, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), who virtually committed suicide, even if she didn\'t die walking out into the middle of city traffic. What a mess these people were. At virtually all times, the picture is an intense psychological thriller that eventually descends into horror when Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) succumbs to her delusions and her mind begins to slip away under the stress of performing. That she quite literally becomes the Black Swan of the title by committing suicide to achieve her career zenith makes for a stunning finale, and the cheers of the crowd may have just as well heralded Portman\'s Oscar Win for Best Actress among a respectable field at the 2011 Awards. For potential viewers, be aware of more than a share of shocking scenes, with one in particular approaching, if not actually achieving, a level of undisguised pornography.'"

"It's 480 BC and the Greek city states are faced with a massive invading Persian army. The Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and a force of 300 men march to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae to face King Xerxes and his army. The cliff narrows to a small opening to negate Xerxes' numerical advantage. They would hold the pass until they are betrayed.This is all about director Zack Snyder's vision to adapt this Frank Miller graphic novel. It is a cinematic full screen representation of a comic book. He's taken the beauty and essence of a 2-dimensional artform onto the big screen. He has taken the successful 'Sin City' style to the next level.The story is fairly basic. It's a lot of machismo and lots of abs. Gerard Butler holds the movie together in a thankless job in this visual vortex. The dialog can be very stilted, but it fits the story well."
"'When the ambitious King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas\'s army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.The epic The 300 Spartans is a great tale of courage, heroism and idealism. This remake is more cartoonist and violent, with monsters and giants as if it were a video game. The Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro is unrecognizable in the role of the King Xerxes. I usually do not like remakes, but this one gives a different approach to the heroic King Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans that defended their country in 480 BC. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): 300'"
"'Frank Miller\'s graphic novel of ancient Greek battle becomes Matrix-ized splatter-flick, though one with a bemused smirk and black blood (making it somewhat more tolerable than horror-themed slaughters with a high body count). Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta, facing a humiliating loss of freedom from neighboring Persia, whose massive army is mythical in its legion. Despite a mere 300 men under his leadership, and a warning from the Oracle that all Greece will fall, Butler\'s Leonidas devises a plan to combat the Persian soldiers and their king, Xerxes (who has a God complex as well as a kinky bent). Despite the orgiastic violence (countless impalements, gorings, decapitations, and disembowlments) and the brawny six-packs on the men--nearly every one of them--the film isn\'t intrinsically charged (either sexually in the masochistic sense or vitally). The matte paintings and other elaborate effects never take on a life of their own, and the scenario doesn\'t sizzle. Instead, it\'s a fairly straight-forward war film, and many will see this as an attribute. The screenplay includes several good lines of sharp or jaded dialogue, and yet the macho brute force is one-note. The repetition eventually wears one down, and the picture has nowhere to go after the one-hour mark. ** from ****'"
"'What a pure masterpiece here. A terrific, outstanding movie, so powerful. A head hit in the face, I can\'t explain better. All away from clichÃ©s, a billion miles from everything you have already seen about the subject, with the usual scheme of the good American authorities fighting against the evil cartels. Nothing of that here. It\'s not good vs evil scheme, but evil vs eviler. That\'s all. Period. Benicio Del Torro will forever be for drug cartel films what John Wayne was for westerns. And Del Torro\'s character\'s name in this feature is Medellin.... One more thing. This settings could have been Afghanistan or Irak where Special Forces would have to fight against Muslims terrorists. But instead of that, this movie takes place in Mexico, near the US border, and the fight in question against drug cartels instead. The kind of action film, busted with testosterone, that won\'t be forgotten, and also which makes you think long after the viewing. A pure true masterpiece.'"
"I had a feeling this was going to be slated, and some of the criticism is justified, but in all honesty I liked it. The opening scenes are fantastic, it's a very smart looking film, it looks great. The content of the film is decent, it's such a shame that Robert Englund didn't do the film, but I can imagine he feels it's a role that's well and truly in the past. That fact was a nail in the coffin for the film, I'm not sure what many were expecting.Some of the scares are a little on the tame side by today's standards, but the story is good, it deserved a bit more loving that it got. 7/10."
"It takes effort and skill to pull off a project like this.Twenty years ago Marvel had comic characters that translated into poor films while DC had Batman and Superman movies.Now Marvel Films have a juggernaut. They released their second tier superheroes (Thor, Captain America) to great acclaim and it all lead up to The Avengers film where the characters of the Marvel cinema universe converged.Iron Man as portrayed by Robert Downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up Captain America. There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office."

There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office."
"One thing that remains constant in this action packed thriller. Denzel Washington's mysterious former life remains just that throughout the movie. What organization did he work for? Who were these two people from the group that we briefly see.Settling down to a quiet life following his wife's passing, that is all upset when he meets a Russian girl, most likely a hooker, who is being harassed by her Russian gangster mates.The rest of the film is devoted to Denzel assuming a Rambo role and killing the first group, which sends others after him. All we then see are violent, horrible ways that Denzel kills his prey."
"In ordinary circumstances, I don't crave for action flicks where super heroes fight against very evil guys with highly expected results. But this film is the exception. It reminds me many late eighties and early nineties action movies produced by Joel Silver, such as the LETHAL WEAPON or DIE HARD series, or even LAST BOYSCOUT. These were perfectly done, absolutely flawless. Like this one.Denzel Washngton is terrific, action sequences astounding and the bad guys outstanding, especially the new comer whose I certainly won't forget the face. The face to face between him and Washington is awesome, as I LOVE SOOOOO MUCH!!!Even everything here is predictable, it is, I repeat, so well done, in a so professional way: film making, acting, screen writing, editing.And, above all, there is not here any silly, stupid, run of the mill f...romance stuff for sissies. Just touching moments. A movie may be poignant without being marsh mallow. But there are here some missing sequences; such as this one, just after the armed robbery at the store where Washington works, a robbery where the Hood takes the female employee's ring. Washington let him go, runs to take a big hammer, and the scene after he brings the ring back without any explanation... You have here some short cuts as this one. But I assure you that doesn't reduce the quality of this terrific actionner."
"19-year-old Jay Height (a fine and sympathetic performance by Maika Monroe) has sex with the mysterious Hugh (an effectively antsy portrayal by Jake Weary) in the back seat of his car. Unbeknownst to Jay, Hugh was being relentlessly stalked by a deadly and persistent carnal supernatural force that's now after her.Writer/director David Robert Mitchell relates the inspired and absorbing story at a hypnotically gradual pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a believably mundane everyday reality, ably crafts a potently unsettling sense of pure flesh-crawling dread and unease, and offers an original otherworldly demon which could very well represent a fatal sexually transmitted disease ala AIDS, the deep-seated fear and inevitability of death, and even the feelings of guilt and shame that the puritanical American culture ascribes to people engaging in intercourse for pleasurable purposes. Moreover, this film's strangely timeless quality adds immensely to its overall eerie and unnerving atmosphere while the fact that the demonic force moves slow, but never gives up and seems unstoppable ensures that this picture is guaranteed to really get under your skin. In addition, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Lili Sepe as Jay's concerned sister Kelly, Daniel Zovatto as the decent Greg Hannigan, Keir Gilchrist as smitten nerd Paul, and Olivia Luccardi as the gawky Yara. The crisp cinematography by Mike Gioulakis makes masterful use of the widescreen format. Rich Vreeland's shivery synthesizer score hits the pulsating shuddery spot. An on the money creepy and disquieting chiller."
"I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before. It felt a bit like that to me, though that does not necessarily apply to any other viewer of course.Give it a chance on Disc, if you haven't already watched it."
"'CRIMSON PEAK (2015) *** Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnan, Jim Beaver, Burn Gorman, Leslie Hope, Doug Jones, Jonathan Hyde, Bruce Gray. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro\'s lavish, epic homage to Gothic horror and Poe\'s Fall of the House of Usher echoes in this impeccably produced yet middling rote ghost story circa 19th century New York with Wasikowska finding her haunted life further enhanced after being swept off her feet by Brit Hiddleston who has a secret agenda of deadly proportions. Beautiful production design by Thomas E. Sanders and luscious cinematography by Dan Lausten heighten the average storyline to new depths of horror and a teeth-gnashing, crazed turn by Chastain as Hiddleston\'s over-sexed, angry sibling is definitely just cause to be afraid.'"
"It's a new reboot of Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). This time, the love interest is Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). There is a bit about his parents tying them to Peter's powers.Marc Webb takes over the franchise. It's a surprising move but he does a good job. It's slightly less comical than Sam Raimi. Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock are far superior villains than Rhys Ifans. So the franchise continues, but not a total revolution. Just new people. The constant rebooting may wear people out someday."
"'The most important thing you might wanna know about this review is that I am certainly NOT in the target demographic group for this film. As a 53 year-old man, I am not the type to ever watch Pitch Perfect in the first place and did so only because my daughter insisted that it was a good film and I would enjoy it. And, fortunately, I did enjoy it quite a bit. Now I am NOT saying I think it\'s a great film, it certainly has its faults, but it is fun and entertaining.The film is about a capella singing....certainly not the sort of thing most of us enjoy or even care about...though the film manages to infuse the subject with enthusiasm. And, you\'ll soon find yourself moving along with the singing...and much of it is very infectious. And, the film is about most every stereotype I could think of when it comes to young adult films---you have the bossy and nasty leader of the group, the lesbian, the fat girl who is funny and the rest of the clichÃ©s (such as the final big number where not only do ALL the ladies know the lyrics BUT also the choreography of a song they NEVER practiced). But, it manages to make it enjoyable because it SAYS that these are stereotypes at times and the music is pretty cool. I could have done without all the vomit, however. Overall, this is a very watchable and enjoyable picture.'"
"'It has so many virtues than it is real difficult to say why you love it. First, the cast and one of the most precious gifts is the presence of Christopher Lee in a small role. Second, the visual delight , good piece of a long smart horror tradition. In same measure , the humor and the fine touch of Gothic, and the make-up. The story itself ? Good people, it is a Tim Burton ! The story can be under ground, like useful seed . No , doubts, pure delight.'"
"You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission."
"'it is the only word who can describe a great film like this. because, in its case, all is perfect. in so manner than it is strange to search the source of its bitter , fascinating beauty. Daniel Day-Lewis is the same from film to film. each nuance, each gesture, each word represent the example of high precision. Paul Dano could be a surprise but , in fact, he does only the role who expect you if you do not ignore his work before this film. scene by scene, the film is the splendid example of dark poetry. about ambition and about manner to use it. about demons and about victories price. about solitude. and, sure, about the essence of evil. a total show. a magnificent work.'"
"Plenty of suspense and anxiety to keep you wiggling in your seat. Kudos to Jaume Collet-Serra's direction of David Johnson's gritty screenplay. Wishes of a home sweet home go to the wayside, when Kate Coleman(Vera Farmigo)and husband John(Peter Sarsgaard), who recently lost a baby due to miscarriage, decide to adopt. Ready or not the couple visit an orphanage, where they meet Esther(Isabelle Fuhrman), a dark haired, dark eyed mature nine-year-old. The adoption seems to be a fresh start for all; except for the other two Coleman children. Not long after bringing Esther home, a series of accidents at home and school lead Kate to believing that her new daughter is not as innocent as she seems. John doesn't see the young girl's wicked side and loses confidence in his wife. No one really knows the truth about Esther's past...until it is almost too damn late.The snowy winter weather and demure creepy music blend into the anxious atmosphere. You can feel the simmering fear and the few scenes of real violence are definitely graphic. Miss Fuhram is an outstanding young actress. In this role she is mesmerizing. She appears to have the tools already for a very interesting career. Also in the cast: CCH Pounder, Jimmy Bennett and an impressive young Aryana Engineer. To me, ORPHAN has what you go to the movies for. Yes, some images are disturbing and the language is coarse; but still I recommended highly."
"It's the 60s on a New England island. Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe. He falls for Suzy Bishop who lives on the island with her parents. The two awkward outsider teens run away setting off chaos among the other characters.This is Wes Anderson's movie all the way through. There is no mistaking his style. He is now as recognizable as any film style ever made. Everything is set up for a good flowing story. They have a dangerous storm bearing down on them. People are out looking for them. But then they're caught midway thru the movie.It detours a bit after that. The pace slows and the story rambles on. It's still very compelling, but it could have been much simpler and better. The kids are great. We have Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand. There are big time stars and they are all solid in their roles. Overall a very good job."
"MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) *** Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Bob Balaban, Jason Schwartzman. Wes Anderson's ever straddling of genius filmmaking and twee dioramatic storytelling continues in this funny and light-hearted boy-meets-girl comedy about a precocious adolescent romance between a scout (Gilman) and a paramour in the lovely form of a misunderstood girl (Hayward) who embark on a secret rendezvous only to be thwarted by ever-vigilant scoutmaster Norton (having fun at being a by-the-book nebbish); local law enforcement (melancholic Willis); the girls' miserable parents (Murray and McDormand) and the hands of fate. Deadpanned to a dire degree with its deliveries of sharp, smart and funny dialogue courtesy of Anderson and frequent collaborator Roman Coppola with its cute-as-homemade-shoes approach to a 1965 cameo of a timeless puppy love affair."
"'The Indy style movie has become so popular, major studios have copied it. This film has a well written script, effective sound track, excellent acting, background distractions, and of course quirky memorable characters. The film might may be best classified as a light drama, leaning toward comedy.In this 1965 tale two misfit 12 year kids conspire to run off together. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a teased orphan scout. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is the daughter of two lawyers. They live on a New England island. A search party for the two missing youths is lead by sad dumb policeman Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Captain Sharp is having an affair with the mother of Suzy (Frances McDormand). Bill Murray plays the rather straight husband.There is a scene where the two youths get close to each that made me uncomfortable for a moment. Fortunately the scene didn\'t last long and the film returned to its quirky self, with bits of dark comedy. While it is PG-13, I wouldn\'t want my 13 year old to watch it. It might give them ideas.This is Kara Haywood\'s first full length film. I see a great career for her.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Kara Haywood in bra/undies. Some groping.'"
"'A delicate, effervescent and, above all, sweet film from the formidable cinematic imagination of Wes Anderson.A group of adults played by the likes of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton join forces (when they\'re not bickering with one another) to track down a pair of kids who have run off to be together. The film is about the pangs of adolescence and particularly the pangs of being labeled a troubled adolescent by an adult world that seems to have forgotten that it was once young too. But it\'s also about the struggles of being an adult role model, wanting to give kids a good example but not always being sure how. The movie illustrates how exhilarating, rewarding, exhausting and -- let\'s face it -- outright terrifying it is to be a parent or a guardian.It\'s a beautiful film, one that anchors its facetious and sarcastic style with genuine and honest emotion. There are a couple of quite lovely moments, especially one between Frances McDormand and her daughter and another between Edward Norton\'s scout leader and one of the boys under his charge, that are tear inducing, but in a sweet, quiet way, not an obvious, shameless one.And it\'s amazing to both look at and listen to, with some knock your socks off music scored by Alexandre Desplat.Grade: A'"
"'This film tells the story of a talented computer genius, who is invited to a mysterious research facility to test the latest artificial intelligence.I have heard many good things about Ex Machina, and it certainly lives up to expectations. First of all, the physical location of the house is magnificent. The house itself is super stylish and modern, I like it so much that I want to live in it! Another great thing is that Domnhall Gleeson looks super young and innocent in the film, which is well suited to the surprise ending. Visuals of Ava are stunning because she looks so real.Suspense is well built and maintained throughout. The plot is so mysterious and intriguing. As I was watching the film, I came up with a few possibilities of how things may end, but I was only partially right. I very much enjoyed this film.'"
"EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it."
"'What makes us human? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he\'s a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially bro Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It\'s really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren\'t there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn\'t he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain\'t. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it'"
"'a joy to discover it. because it is more than a fairytale adaptation but field for beautiful acting, smart script, joy and irony and a Robert de Niro from old times. a film who serves the book in a splendid manner because, more than any other virtue, it is alive. the adventures, the love story, the fight against the evil, the different levels of events, the poetry of photography are real, seductive and, maybe, a delight. a film for a special age, more to remind memories than for the children. because it use the entire magic of the novel in wise style. and that is a more than good point - it is a lovely surprise. trip in strange universe, it is inspired tool for remember the importance of small details who defines the life.'"
"'In the 1800\'s, the clumsy teenager Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) crosses the wall in the border of his town to the magic realm of Stormhold to bring a fallen star to his beloved Victoria (Sienna Miller), a spoiled girl that does not love him but has promised to marry him if he accomplishes his promise. In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine (Claire Danes) and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King (Peter O\'Toole) of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone. Meanwhile, three evil witches led by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) seek Yvaine to eat her heart and make them young again, and the two sons of the dead king also search Ivaine because she wears the necklace with the powerful ruby.Stardust is one of the most delightful movies that I have recently seen. The engaging story has fantasy, adventure, romance, comedy, a clumsy hero, a nice heroin and evil villains with a wonderful screenplay; awesome direction of the director of Layer Cake; stunning cast and magnificent special effects. Stardust is the type of pleasant film that deserves to be watched many times. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Stardust Â O MistÃ©rio da Estrela (Stardust Â The Mystery of the Star)'"
It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel VerdÃº) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel VerdÃº. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential. The violence can be brutal. It's like a fairy tale fantasy got mixed up with a horror movie.
"Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."
"Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, an extraordinary fairy tale set in 1940's Spain.. A quiet, free thinking young girl Ofelia(Ivana Baquero)is forced to move with her pregnant mother to the compound of her adoptive father Captain Vidal(Sergi Lopez), who is a ruthless fascist still hunting rebels in the surrounding woody region. The throes of the Spanish Civil War lingers and young Ofelia's imagination lets her inter a world where she is a Princess of a land sheltered by a labyrinth of ancient natural rock. Graphic violence and strange, but interesting CGI creatures. Kudos to cinematographer Guillermo Navarro. Other cast members: Maribel Verdu, Doug Jones, Alex Angulo, Ariadna Gil and Manolo Solo. This movie is well worth all honors bestowed."
"'Yeah, I\'m not going to lie: my inner 12 year-old loves this movie. Or at least parts of it. Whenever Will Ferrell and John C Reilly are at war, it sends me into a fit of giggles - and totally feels like they\'d ad-libbed half this stuff. It\'s when these scenes are awkwardly melded into the overall family story that the humor starts to go flat; despite the cast involved. That said, Rob Riggle steals every one of his scenes. And Reilly\'s random Boats and hoes! outbursts has been in my head for ten years now. It\'s so lovably dumb.'"
"Exceedingly stupid but occasionally funny tale of two forty year old live at home guys who become step brothers when their parents marry.Its Will Ferrell so you know that the IQ level of the film is going to be pretty low (if it was a person it would just have language skills). Better than most Ferrell movies in that there actually are some laughs, but at the same time thats kind of like finding an upside to chewing on aluminum foil. Snotty comments aside I actually like the film some what. I've seen it a couple more times in pieces since its been out on DVD and I have to say that there really are some funny pieces. I still don't think that the film works as a whole but it is amusing enough to try at some point."
"'The smalltime thief Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) lives stealing steel, bronze and copper material from the streets of Los Angeles and is seeking a job. When he sees a freelance cameraman filming an accident, he decides to invest money in a camcorder and a police scanner radio from a pawn shop. He overhears the name of Nina Romina (Rene Russo), who is responsible for the TV news of a television station and he sells his first footage. Louis learns how to improve his films and hires the homeless Rick (Riz Ahmed) to help him. When his competitor Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) discloses his new van and equipment to Louis, he sabotages his van, causing a serious accident. The ambitious Louis is a sociopath and for him gore means a better payment for his footages. So he leaves the position of crime photographer to interfere in crime scenes, climbing in his new career. Nightcrawler is a weird and original movie with one of the bleakest characters that I have recently seen on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal has an impressive performance in the role of an ambitious sociopath that is capable to do anything to climb in his new job. The plot is totally unpredictable and mesmerizes the viewer that can not foresee the next move of Louis. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): O Abutre (The Volture)'"
"'Jake Gyllenhaal has played a number of good roles over the past two decades, and he continues this streak with Nightcrawler. He plays a man who decides to make a career filming sensationalistic events and selling the footage to a local TV station. It\'s hard to determine which party is more amoral: the man shooting the footage to further his own career, or the TV station more interested in attracting viewers than performing serious journalism. Either way, Gyllenhaal\'s character is a truly scary individual. His blank stare hides sociopathic tendencies.One could interpret the movie as a cynical look at the media, or as a cynical look at our society\'s obsession with sensational stories. After all, aren\'t the media simply giving people what they want? Whatever the case, Nightcrawler is a good movie. It gives LA the same seedy look that the average film noir used to show.'"
"A psychological thriller directed by Bryan Bertino. Forget popcorn and soft drinks; try a fistful of Xanax and adult diapers. Sorry, that was foolishly going overboard. THE STRANGERS will have you drowning in anxiety and listening to your own blood chill. A young suburban couple Kristen(Liv Tyler)and James(Scott Speedman)need some peace and quiet and time to think as they arrive at a secluded family vacation home. You don't always get what you want. Rapping at the door becomes bagging on the door. Strangers staring at the house and peeking through writing on the windows. It is a living nightmare as three masked strangers invade the couple's privacy. It is amazing what you can bring yourself to do when survival is on the line. This is not the time to hear someone at the door or your cellphone to ring. It is so much fun to be terrified."
"'Apart from the based on true ... thing on the beginning, which by the way is my new big NO for a movie ... I just can\'t stand that hypocritical use of this phrase. Every other movie is than based on true events. Most of the romantic comedies are, teen comedies etc. etc. At least some parts are true or did happen in real life, which is why the script writer thought them up ...But I should stop ranting about that (and the fact, that a voice over at the beginning of the movie, isn\'t entirely correct ... well you see). This movie promises to scare you and it delivers. Mood-wise it stays close to a french movie called Ils (Them), which was a great suspense thriller/horror. I also liked the relationships between the two main characters. You could say it\'s standard fare, but it has great framing and lighting (sound design is scary too).'"
"In an alternate 1985, superheroes and costumed vigilantes exist. They formed the Minutemen in 1940 but the . Nixon is the president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed by a skilled assassin. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks that somebody is trying to kill all the heroes. Dan Dreiberg aka Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is semi-retired and thinks Rorschach is too paranoid. Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a wealthy celebrity. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is the all-powerful all-seeing indestructible superhero. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) had put away her Silk Spectre identity and trying to maintain a human relationship with Dr. Manhattan. Her mother Sally (Carla Gugino) was the original Silk Spectre but is now a drunk.It's a dark ambitious world that Zack Snyder and friends have created. It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance. There are many great aspects that they easily smooth out any bumps in the road."
"'Doug Liman the talent behind Swingers, Go, The Bourne Identity, among others, scores a coup with Mr. and Mrs. Smith! Mr. Liman shows he has what it takes to direct intelligent and entertaining films such as this one. The screen play by Simon Kinberg keeps the viewer glued to the seat. This is a film that arrives with a built in publicity that has been generating the kind of excitement from all the tabloids as the rumors, true, or false, of the romance of the two beautiful stars, were the talk of the gossip columns. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are actors that are not only photogenic, both radiate sex appeal all over the place. In their scenes together one can\'t take one\'s eyes from them for fear one might lose something important.Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a good summer film in which to get lost. The story about these two agents, working for two different outfits that are going after one another is a good way to spend a couple of hours at the movies. The film will not disappoint the action fans that will surely flock to watch this amazing new film.Angelina Jolie is a fine actress who commands our attention at all times. Brad Pitt is an actor that excels under good direction. Adrian Brody is seen in the pivotal part of Benjamin and Kerry Washington also shines as Jazmin.Doug Liman does it again!'"
"'If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn\'t know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the Facebook movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can\'t really answer that, but I\'m guessing he read the book, the main character of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don\'t know, but it\'s not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder. And Mr. Timberlake might finally get recognized as a real actor, too. He\'s earned it.'"
"'40-somethings Billy and Nick are brilliant salesmen, but that counts for nothing when their employer shuts down. Needing to find what to do next, they try out for the intern program at Google, where they end up applying their life skills and experiences as part of a team of misfits.My experience has been that both Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson are lazy actors - they play the same parts and give the same performances in every film, and The Internship does not overturn that formula. However, they also have an easy and likable chemistry as we saw in the Wedding Crashers, and this works well for them here. This is a gentle, likable comedy, where most of the characters are pleasant company, the chuckles are frequent and the smiles constant, the moral statements worth making and fairly subtly delivered, and the romance (Wilson and Rose Byrne) nicely played.By no means a classic, neither is it in any way offensive (apart from a single unwelcome F-bomb). I positively enjoyed it.'"
"'I firmly believe Monster House is the best animated film of 2006. I did like Happy Feet and Cars, but Monster House beats them both in my opinion. It is superbly animated, with the colours really bold and the character designs and backgrounds really interesting. I also liked the music, which further added to the atmosphere, while the story is briskly paced and smartly written. My favourite assets though are the script and characters. The characters are brilliantly written and wonderfully voiced, while the script is witty and inquisitive. Overall, I love Monster House and strongly recommend it for pretty much anybody really. 10/10 Bethany Cox'"

"I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films."
"Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy. It sets the tone for the final two."
"'. . . as the AGE OF ULTRON appears to last just a few hours. But even that brief span of Time proved long enough for Ultron to send the guy seated three spots to my right into La-La Land, as his sonorous snoring competed with the Surround Sound for the final hour of this flick. Obviously, providing hours of mental clutter-induced deep sleep is one of the Disney Mega-Corp\'s main goals in latching on to Marvel Studios. Soon Disney will merge the X-MEN and the AVENGERS into one film, guaranteed to send sleep-deprived members of Big Families or those with apartments next to the El into an elusive snooze after the first 20 minutes of endless super hero introductions involving the exchange of birth names, Noms De Guerre, aliases, and pet monikers. Instead of blaring country music non-stop at America\'s terrorist rendition Black Sites, the psychological warfare torturers will be able to alternate between twang and Marvel movies.'"
"'Writer-director Quentin Tarantino\'s 8th film, as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people\'s idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock\'s new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter\'s 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus The Thing (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott\'s Alien from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino\'s belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story\'s context, is welcomed), though the film\'s 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a Chapter Five prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson\'s excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we\'re snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone\'s ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****'"
'Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better'
"After the encounter with Voldemort at The Triwizard Tournament, opinions are divided on Harry Potter. Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge is determine to squash the news of Voldemort's return, and demonize Potter and Dumbledore. The world is coming down on Potter. First he's charged with underage magic when he fought off 2 dementors. Then he finds that Dumbledore has been keeping his distance. Finally, there's a new strict devious teacher Dolores Umbridge play by the amazing Imelda Staunton.It is truly dark time as Hogwarts fall into the hands of the evil Umbridge from the absent Dumbledore. Potter is convinced to form a group of students to learn magic on their own. More and more, Voldemort is coming out of the shadows. Torturing the students is really a new level of darkness in this series. There is a real sense of evil in this one more than the others. It is mostly due to the performance of Imelda Staunton and her evil character Umbridge. It sets the tone for the series from here on out."
"My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better. All in all, a lovely looking film, with some flaws in the first half. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!"
"Boy, Denzel Washington really uses his acting chops to play such a flawed character who's both heroic and pathetic! I mean, he's a pilot who manages to save most of his passengers on a plane that obviously wasn't very functional when he boarded it despite his drinking and having a snort just several hours ago. That's just for starters on what is perhaps the most compelling dramatic picture of the year directed with a sure hand by Robert Zemeckis in another of his surprise moves since he's usually associated with more commercially entertaining movies like Back to the Furure or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Well, not everything here is meant for serious thinking as John Goodman is a great hoot as his supplier! But just seeing the range Washington displays here is enough for me to highly recommend Flight wholeheartedly. So if you like something more challenging for your brain, see it!"
"'The captain William Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) of South Jet Air is a divorced man with an estranged ex-wife and son and is having an affair with the flight attendant Katerina Trina Marquez (Nadine Velazquez). Whip spends the night in Orlando with Trina drinking, using cocaine and having sex.On the next morning, he assumes the Flight 227 to Atlanta and he faces turbulence at the takeoff. Out of the blue, the plane has a mechanical problem and the skilled Whip crashes the plane in an empty field and saves the lives of ninety-six persons on board; however, four passengers and two crew members, one of them Trina, died. Whip learns that there will be an investigation by his friend Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) from the union and the defense lawyer Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) tells him that he may have a life sentence since his blood test indicates that he was intoxicated with alcohol and drugs. Charlie and Hugh also tell him to be sober along the next days. But Whip is an alcoholic and can not control addiction.Flight is a powerful drama about alcoholism with top-notch performance of Denzel Washington. There are great movies about this theme, like The Lost Weekend, Days of Wine and Roses, The Verdict and Leaving Las Vegas and Flight can be included in this selection. Flight\' has also a great message of ethics and redemption, with a positive conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): O Voo (The Flight)'"
"This first section is for American readers and/or others who are prude. There is nudity in this film! I was actually shocked to see that, not because I had a problem with it, but because I never thought the movie would start this way. So if you have a problem with nudity (you shouldn't, but I know some do and that's OK), be aware of that fact! The rating should indicate the reason for it getting an R, I'm sure.Having put that out of the way, let us concentrate on the essential. You might have read about this movie and might have a picture how this is. Denzel Washington might be one of the few people who will be able to blow away those expectations. Plus the movie might not exactly go into the direction you think it will. It's really about one character and the journey he takes (no pun intended). If you can stomach it (the character can, kind of), then this will be very rewarding (hopefully)"
"'Someone described this as screwball, but I reckon they got confused a bit. Otherwise the review wasn\'t bad about the movie, a movie that is awkward, strange and absurdist to say the least. And for some I reckon it will be boring. Because it\'s not obvious comedy most of the time. It\'s fun in the strange, in the not normal form.Things that will make you shake your head in disbelief and ideas that you will find strange, either in a good/funny sense or in a I don\'t like that kind of way. That all depends on your sense of humor and I\'m pretty sure even on your mood while watching this. Try to be as open minded as possible and you may enjoy this. If not, you better stop it early on, because the movie does keep its tone throughout ...'"
David (Colin Farrell) is taken to an isolated hotel. His wife has just left him. The hotel clients have 45 days to find a partner before they are turned into an animal. David's dog is his brother after failing to find a match. He selects to be changed into a lobster. There are particular rules and planned events to the hotel.This is one strange movie. It does have an internal logic which it is able to keep. It's weirdly funny at times. The deadpan mannerism doesn't keep the movie static. It is able to maintain a compelling story despite its peculiar world. This movie has ideas and it stays with them. Yorgos Lanthimos and his collaborator Efthymis Filippou have done some weird stuff like Dogtooth. This one is able to recruit top shelf acting talents. The second half gets over-extended as it tries to expand the world. The hotel is such a curious place that I would rather stay there for the whole movie.
"A psychological thriller from director James Wan. According to Merriam-Webster...Insidious:treacherous; having a collective effect. Josh Lambert(Patrick Wilson)moves his family into a brand new home and immediately Josh and his wife Renai(Rose Byrne)hear strange noises in the middle of the night. The next day their son Dalton(Ty Simpkins) informs his mother that he doesn't like his new room; actually afraid of whats in his room. Even Dalton's brother is afraid of the footsteps he hears in the night. Dalton becomes sick and falls into a mysterious coma. The doctors can't explain the coma or the other hospital tests. The boy is taken home where his body begins to attract a malevolent force. When the Lamberts begin to realize there is a real threat, they move to another home hoping to leave the convincing evil spirit behind. Well, that's when their problems really get serious. Cinematography is super; wish I could say the same for the last third of the movie. The Lamberts must give in to the supernatural to awaken their son from his coma. I just can't get into Wilson or his character. Byrne is no better. Others in the cast: Angus Sampson, John Henry Binder, Ruben Pla and Barbara Hershey."
"'it is the first conclusion. for a lot of motives: to discover an impossible adaptation, to admire high coherence of a mix of different stories who become one, to enjoy by the performance of a great cast . to understand the rules of history, to open a large window to the future, to be impressed by splendid images , to travel across the genres and periods for see again basic truth. short, one of films who represents a wonderful show. and little more. a fresco who gives lines to define the life not only as adventure but as battle to conquer your sense. it is unfair to describe it. and, maybe, impossible. because, after the credits, the beauty of a story who seems be just a firework is the most precious gift of the large team who create this spectacular work. because the beauty, in the case of Cloud Atlas has so many meanings. and nuances.'"
"'This is one of those experiences that defy explanation (similar to the one I had watching 2001: A Space Odyssey). I had read the book a year before and if you had asked me to pick a book that could never be made into a movie, I would have easily selected this. How wrong I was. This masterful concoction kept me intrigued for nearly three hours and yet I\'m still trying to figure things out. I agree with the late Roger Ebert that even with two or three viewings, I am still trying to put this all together. It doesn\'t matter. It\'s like looking at a painting on repeated visits to a museum, maybe the works of Breughel or Bosch. There are some themes that run through the multiple characters\' existences, touching on oppression and endurance of the human soul. The performances are wonderful. I would imagine that the likes of Tom Hanks must have been in heaven, extending their acting chops. I need to watch the film again, but for now will leave it to those more intellectually astute to look at the implications of the tenets of this film. I would recommend it as an experience everyone should have.'"
"'Wow, awesome, epic. it was more than just a party movie. lots of awesome scenes with good music. very entertaining with lots of funny parts (2 viewings)\nSPOILERS\nkept getting bigger and crazier, more than i would have imagined.'"
"'This film is about the prince of Asgard who gets banished to the Earth for his impulsive action to protect his father\'s realm.Thor is quite refreshing as it mixes historical drama with modern day life in a science fiction context. Such a blend may seem out of place in other films, but Thor blends these ideas well. The plot is well explained and engaging. Visuals are great, especially the roaring clouds and the fight scenes on the bridge. Both Thor and Loki are superbly depicted characters. Everything from the characters, story and visuals are so convincing and real. Thor is very entertaining, but it is more than just a popcorn summer blockbuster.'"
"'This is the first feature animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky. I knew of him previously from his work on Cartoon Network\'s Samurai Jack which I remember being quite amused by. So now he\'s made this computer-animated one about Dracula and his daughter and his attempts to keep her from encountering some humans since he\'s very much prejudiced against them which gets a good explanation as the film goes on. I\'ll stop there and just say how funny and touching the whole thing was which wasn\'t surprising since not only was Tartakovsky involved but a lot of former SNLers which not only included co-writer Robert Smigel but also the voices of Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Andy Samberg, and Chris Parnell. Oh, and one of my favorite lines concerns how the Dracula character is appalled by how some people think his kind says Bla, bla, bla. How hilarious! Okay, so on that note, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania.'"
"'The film opens with a loving nurturing Dracula caring for his daughter in 1895. In order to protect her from evil humans he constructs a huge castle as a refuge for monsters which include, Frankenstein, wolfman, invisible man, bigfoot, zombies, ghouls, Quasimodo etc. We then move to the present as his teen looking daughter turns 118 and wants to see the world. Before the first human shows up we already know the script.There were a number of fun things about the monsters that kids would enjoy but adults will find tiresome. Dracula constantly denies saying blah, ba-blah, ba-blah. There is one scene the kids laughed at and that was when someone pulled down the swimming trunks of the Invisible Man. He quickly pulls them back up, tells people I just got out of the pool! It\'s cold! Don\'t judge me! At one point the Invisible Man is playing charades, which he admits, I\'m not very good at.At one point Dracula asks if humans would accept them (the monsters) if they came out. I\'m sure there was some kind of message there.As an adult, I was basically bored with the film which had such great potential. 4 stars from a kids view. Not really scary or funny.'"
"It's one of those guilty films I've watched with the kids, but secretly enjoyed as much, if not more then they did. The animation is fantastic, the voice overs terrific, but it's the humour that still stands out, it is so wonderfully funny. It has a nice message too, one hopefully kids can see and accept. Count Dracula has never ever been so cool. Classic Halloween choice. 9/10"
"A half dozen of adventurous young ladies opt to go spelunking in Chattooga National Park. Rather than go to the designated cave, the leader takes them to a cave that has not been explored before. A cave-in traps them and forces them to go farther into the cave in hopes of discovering another way out. And wouldn't you know it, this is the cave that has man-eating hominoids with big ugly teeth.It was a fairly interesting film that has stood the test of time. There is some drama and tension between the ladies.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"'Not the most overwhelming thing from director Ridley Scott, but not exactly underwhelming. Commend Drew Goddard for putting Andy Weir\'s book way out there. Mark Watney (Matt Damon)is an astronaut and superior botanist that finds himself abandoned on the surface of Mars after his crew concludes that he perished in a major dust storm. Watney with his intellect and humor must find a way to survive the harsh planet.His former crew is high-tailing it back to Earth and is not told my NASA command that Watney is planting/growing potatoes and producing water for sustenance. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) is too embarrassed and ashamed at first to tell the world that the astronaut has been discovered alive by astrodynamics nerd Rich Purnell (Donald Glover) and has convinced space scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) that a rescue is very possible with some major help of international scientists, especially the Chinese space program that has the perfect rocket to get the Herculean effort underway. After being told, his original mission colleagues led by commanding officer Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) are more than ready and able to join in the rescue watched around the world.This film is held together with a soundtrack a bit better than astronaut Watney prefers. Music by the likes of Donna Summer, Abba, The O\'Jays, The Hues Corporation, David Bowie and Gloria Gaynor\'s anthem I Will Survive.Other cast members featured: Kristen Wiig, Michael Pena, Mackensie Davis, Askel Hennie, Sean Bean and Kate Mara.'"
"'Ridley Scott is famous for bringing Alien and Bladerunner to the big screen. Both have huge followings and both are amazing for their time when they were made. Now with The Martian he brings a great sci-fi film to us but one with an entirely different mood--so much so that it\'s hard to believe it\'s from this famed filmmaker! Why? Because the mood is so much more positive and upbeat--and it\'s a film that leaves you happy...something you could never say about the other movies!As far as what I liked about the film and what I disliked, I\'ll make it easy--especially since there are already so many reviews for the movie. What I liked was everything and I hated nothing. There is nothing I would have done differently...and that\'s something I almost never can say. This is a very intelligent, crowd-pleasing quality picture from start to finish and you should see it on the big screen if you can. Yes, it\'s THAT good!'"
"Or even the summer as another reviewer stated! But before I start the review, I have to say/admit, that I don't or better didn't know much about the Transformers world, before I went out to watch the movie. So I can't tell you any differences between the movie and the series or if they forgot/missed something, reinvented the Transformers or anything like that.What I can tell you, is that this movie delivers exactly what it promises. Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!"
"'By now, Cars is an old film--and I am FINALLY getting around to reviewing it. So much for staying ahead of the curve! But because there are already a ton of reviews, I\'ll keep this short.So what did I like about the film? Well, the animation is just unreal-- it\'s gorgeous from start to finish. It\'s obvious that John Lasseter is insane for cars and put a ton of effort into this one. GORGEOUS! As for the rest of the film, it\'s quite good, though I wasn\'t quite as bowled over by it as some. After all, it now has a sequel, a semi-sequel (Planes) and some spin-off \'Mater shorts. I don\'t think the film was THAT good. But it was clearly enjoyable and pleasant throughout. Well worth seeing though I wish that Pixar would stop emphasizing sequels and started work on more originality. I understand why they don\'t, as it\'s all about marketing--and they marketed the crap out of this film.'"
"A hot-shot race-car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) gets waylaid in Radiator Springs on his way to California. He's a brash self-obsessed car mired in a dispute in the racing world. But when he damages the road and is sentenced to repair it, he must slow down, work hard, and find what's truly important in life.Pixar creates another fun franchise. This time the cars are humanized. Like Toy Story, it's always about the characters. It's a great family movie. It has fun but it's also a message movie. The breakout character of this movie must be Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old rusty tow truck. He's definitely the comic relief."
"'While traveling to California for the dispute of the final race of the Piston Cup against The King and Chick Hicks, the famous Lightning McQueen accidentally damages the road of the small town Radiator Springs and is sentenced to repair it. Lightning McQueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals, changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner.In the cute Cars the world is inhabited by automobiles and there is a great message about the meaning of friendship in the wild contemporary competitive world. The hero learns the important lesson that sometimes the true winner is not the one who simply wins the race but uses the heart and does the best. Owen Wilson is amazingly funny giving the voice to the rookie Lightning Queen and it is amazing how some intellectuals do not like this adorable animation. Or maybe they do not have understood the message of the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Carros (Cars)'"

On the way west, an unexpected detour finds Lightning in an almost forgotten town, Radiator Springs, on Route 66 off the interstate. McQueen makes true friendships with some quirky characters--including Mater(Larry the Cable Guy), Sally(Bonnie Hunt), Luigi(Tony Shalhoub)and Doc Hudson(Paul Newman), who happens to have won the Piston Cup several times in his faded career.Among other voices featured are: John Ratzenberger, Cheech Marin, Michael Wallis, Bob Costas and George Carlin. Helping rev up the action is a super soundtrack that features: Sheryl Crow, Rascal Flatts, James Taylor, John Mayer and Brad Paisley. You owe it to yourself to relax and be entertained.

"'One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that Indiana Jones 4 received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it\'s a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it\'s very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg\'s deft touch.There\'s a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce\'s high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it\'s a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it\'s some sort of series disgrace. 7/10'"
"'This film tells the story of a new genetically modified dinosaur that would become the newest attraction of a theme park. However, the dinosaur runs loose, causing massive destruction and casualties.I still remember the first Jurassic Park twenty years ago, when it was so groundbreaking that it led to a whole generation of people worldwide to be enormously interested in dinosaurs. Though Jurassic World may not have the same effect, it still provides a very entertaining and thrilling experience. The dinosaurs are as real as ever, and their brutality is well portrayed. I am also impressed by the two kids, they did very well on screen. The plot tells a cat and mouse chase that provides a constant thrill. The life and death situations made me feel in edge, grabbing my seat very often. I enjoyed the film a lot.'"

"'Three hooligans are hired to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape. Once inside the first thing they see is the body of a dead man in the living room in front of several television screens. While two of them are searching the basement the other young man in the living room finds the tape in a VCR and plays it. He then watches several film segments of gruesome homicides which were recorded first-hand by the victim or perpetrator of these murders. Naturally, because these killings were taped by different people using their own individual video recorders the footage is extremely garbled and shaky. Obviously, this technique is done to give the appearance of a first-hand account of these killings similar in great measure to The Blair Witch Project. However, the downside to this approach is that the overall quality of the movie typically suffers in the process. And so it is with this particular movie as well. Add in the fact that there was no coherent plot which managed to tie these unrelated murders together and the end result was something that made very little sense to me. Accordingly, I have to rate this movie as slightly below average.'"
"'A bunch of horror tales that we see on VHS strung together by a bunch of hooligans breaking into a house to steal a VHS tape. First up is Amateur Night with a bunch of 20 something jerks going to a bar, getting two girls drunk and bringing them home to have sex. However one of the girls has a surprise for them. VERY bloody with female and male frontal nudity. Easily the best story in the movie. Next is Second Honeymoon about two people on a honeymoon being stalked...sort of. Slow and meandering but the ending was surprising. Thursday the 17th is obviously a homage to slasher films. A bunch of brainless college kids go into a forest and are killed off in various ways. The killings are gory and the ending unexpected. Next is The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger. It\'s about a woman being haunted by a ghost. It has a few good moments but ended up being confusing with plenty of gratuitous female nudity. Easily the worst segment. Last up is 10/31/98 about a bunch of friends going to a Halloween party at an abandoned house...and getting more than they bargained for. It starts slow but REALLY works at the end. All in all a good horror anthology that scared me.'"

"The title sequence to this movie was one of the best that I have seen in years. It was fascinating and creative and it alone makes the entire movie worthwhile.The concept is also believable. I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened. Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge, we could see something like this for real. We may not, but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting, too.Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own. He gave an outstanding performance, and I want to see more of him. Vinessa Shaw, Dan Byrd, and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable. hey, they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine)."
"A suburban family who are driving cross country run afoul of a savage mutant clan in the middle of a remote desert. Director Alexander Ahja, who also co-wrote the hard-hitting script with Gregory Levasseur, brings a fierce take-no-prisoners attitude to the harsh and gripping premise, makes fine use of the desolate desert wasteland location, generates plenty of tension, takes time to develop the characters, adeptly crafts a few eerie moments (the crater filled with abandoned automobiles and a ramshackle house that's littered with mannequins rate as especially striking and unsettling set pieces), and delivers a handy helping of unflinchingly graphic gore. The sound acting from the able cast further keeps this film on track: Aaron Stanford as the wimpy Doug, Kathleen Quinlan as the spunky Ethel, Vinessa Shaw as the sweet Lynn, Emilie de Ravin as the perky Brenda, Dan Byrd as the sullen Bobby, and Tom Bower as a grizzled gas station attendant. Moreover, the mutants are quite grotesque and frightening, with Billy Drago as vicious patriarch Papa Jupiter, Robert Joy as the brutish Lizard, and Michael Bailey Smith as hulking beast Pluto registering strongly as the definite scary stand-outs. The startling moments of go-for-the-throat unsparing violence pack a ferocious punch. Both Maxime Alexandre's sharp widescreen cinematography and the shivery score by tomandandy are up to speed. A nice'n'nasty surprise."
"'After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.The casting deserves mention. Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, needs to be in fewer films, and it defies logic that she somehow beat others at audition.Vince Vaughn, Zach Galifianakis and a handful of others bring some star power to this (with all due respect to Emile Hirsch, he is not a household name). Their roles are small but effective. Great job. The Eddie Vedder soundtrack -- do we need two hours of Vedder? No. But we get it just the same.Although the film gets better as it goes (deeper in to the wild), its popularity and high praise are something of a mystery. If anything, it seems to have grown in stature since its first release. Why? While interesting, it never really gets to the meat of its subject. Why rejecting society and civilization was the right decision. Assuming, of course, it was... which is debatable.'"
"Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) abandoned his life, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to Oxfam International and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness after graduating from Emory University. He has always been uncomfortable with material things, and decide to leave that life completely behind. He has some profound experiences along the way to his bus in the Alaskan wilderness.Director Sean Penn adapts Jon Krakauer's novel. This movie is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. This is a beautiful performance from Emile Hirsch. He embodies the role so completely. Sean Penn is able to infuse this movie with the same wanderlust that the real Christopher must have had. And Kristen Stewart has a great minor role. We really have a profound into the wild experience."
"I only have read the first book of the Hunger Games, but seen both movies. The first movie had to be restrained and was compared to a Japanese movie (not without a reason). While this seems a bit like a rehash of the same, it is way better in execution. It's still a bit too long and has some issues, but the comedy bits do work in its favor and there seems to be a switch in pace.Twists aside (which should actually be apparent), most will be looking forward to the conclusion with the third book getting released too. Unfortunately (or is it fortunately?) the third book will be getting the split movie treatment. Until then (and lets hope it won't be the same again, because they will get out of options with doing it again ... and again), enjoy this and Jennifer Lawrence in it."
"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing."

"'In a small town in Denmark, the life of the kindergarten teacher Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) turns upside-down and is destroyed when Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend Theo (Thomas Bo Larsen), lies and tells to the director Grethe (Susse Wold) that he showed his sex to her.Jagten is a Danish-Swedish drama with the storyline of These Three (1936) and The Children\'s Hour (1961). The cruel and heartbreaking story about how destructive a lie may be is updated and the screenplay well-written and with great performances. The commercial conclusion with Lucas apparently fixing his life again after all the bad things that happened to him is the weak part of the plot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): A CaÃ§a (The Hunt)'"
"'The movie starts off interestingly enough and Andrew Garfield almost falls into the Sam Raimi trap (Spiderman 3) where Tobey Maguire had a sequence where he tried to be cool. Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it\'s very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It\'s a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he\'s not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get unleashed is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride. With a few surprises along the way ... well at least one for me!'"
"'If The Amazing Spiderman from 2012 felt like an unnecessary reboot so soon after the original trilogy was completed then this sequel is not going raise much hope for this cycle of films.Andrew Garfield is certainly a zippy and smart Alec web spinner, Emma Stone is an appealing Gwen Stacy but then you rush into the villains where character development reminded more of Batman & Robin.Harry Osborn is introduced as the new heir of Oscorp and a good friend of Peter Parker, something not mentioned in the previous film. Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.'"
"It's not often that I'll favourably compare a remake to the original, but in this instance, I must. I thought the original was a pretty bad film, undoubtedly shocking, and deserving of its infamous name, but the remake I feel captures the essence of the revenge, and desperation of the victim to get her own back.It is of course shocking, and at times is quite sickening to watch, there were plenty of moments when I had to look away, but you can't help but feel a sense of justice as the tables get turned.Very nicely produced, and well acted. A remake I know, but worthy of being deemed something of a horror classic, one to give you a fear of Ravens for life. 8/10"

"'THE GREEN LANTERN (2011) *** Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Peter Sarsgaard, Tim Robbins, Mark Strong, Angela Bassett, Tamuera Morrison (voices of: Geoffrey Rush, Michael Clarke Duncan and Clancy Brown) DC Comics\' cult superhero\'s origin story is given the big-screen treatment with better-than-expected results with cocksure Reynolds nicely cast as hot-shot test pilot Hal Jordan who is reluctantly \'chosen\' by an intergalactic police force known collectively as The Green Lanterns enlisting him to stop a soul-sucking, planet-devouring entity â Parallax (scarily voiced by Brown) â from destroying Earth. Director Martin Campbell gets out the big guns with the visual and special effects (and not too shabby in 3D either) for the popcorn crowd/fanboys while a game cast â including Strong as alien Sinestro (an uncanny resemblance to a Vulcanized John Waters!) â and particularly Reynolds doing the heavy lifting of going from callow fratboy to genuine underdog hero while Sarsgaard gets in touch with his inner John Malkovich as the villainous Hector Hammond â whose icky transformation from a close encounter has him looking like a combo of John Merrick (AKA The Elephant Man) and John Carpenter (!)

"'Three months ago I watched the animated movie that covers essentially the same story, that of the hot-shot, sometimes irresponsible American test pilot that gets recruited into the Green Latern Corps, the several thousand who each have a sector of the universe to protect.Here we get real people telling the story. Ryan Reynolds is the focus as test pilot Hal Jordan. He is flying a test mission to help demonstrate the advantages of a new fighter plane when he pulls a very risky move and ends up destroying the plane. Soon after he is pulled into the presence of a dying Green Lantern, who tells him the ring has chosen you. When he is transported to the secret location, in a far corner of the universe, he is met with much skepticism. All the other green lanterns are from races much older than the human race, and they doubt that an Earthling human has what it takes. This of course provides the drama for Hal\'s quest to prove himself and become what our comic books refer to as the Green Lantern.A large obstacle is the evil monster of sorts that is absorbing the energy of others and in the process growing more powerful. Unstopped it would destroy the universe as we know it. Hal needs to become the hero that stops the monster and in the process earning his status.Good movie, I enjoyed it.'"
"'I really enjoyed this movie. The title is an inspiration of the Freedom Riders that traveled through he USA in the 1960s to protest segregation and suffered for the bigger good of all. The teacher and characters are all taken from these students at a Long Beach high school. The teacher was new and ideal, the students were hardened, mostly gang members, and educators had given up on them.Hilary Swank is Erin Gruwell, the new teacher. Getting little support from the school itself, she took part time jobs to buy the students books, take them on weekend field trips, and have them start writing their own journals, inspired by the Diary of Anne Frank. Eventually they all wrote letters to the Austrian lady, still alive, who had hidden Anne Frank, and raised enough money to have her fly to meet their class.The point of the movie is to show that in spite of the difficulties you happen to be in, you still have choices, and you can choose to accept others with differences, and choose a different path for your life.Good story, outstanding acting.'"
"'Based on the diaries of real Long Beach, California students. Hilary Swank is flawless as the passionate and overly dedicated teacher Erin Gruwell. Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach in the mid 90\'s was comprised of street tough students...the majority Latino, Black and Asian. Some were pure street gangsters; some just abused and or forgotten. The sometimes \'goody-goody\' Gruwell provided a cease-fire zone for her English class students that felt like castaways from their homes as well as certain school faculty. Gruwell sacrificed her own home life and husband(Patrick Dempsey)to save these young people. She helped them reclaim their lives by providing them with journals to write their innermost thoughts, life secrets and hopes and dreams. Erin Gruwell used the Holocaust as her tool to bring awareness to racism and respect for humanity. Based on the book The Freedom Writers Diary by Gruwell and her class, this movie is a must see. Any classroom would find something to learn from this film. Kudos to director and screen writer Richard LaGravenese. Also in the cast are: Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton, Deance Wyatt, April Lee Hernandez and Kristin Herrera.'"
"Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."
After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more. All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film.
"Initially, the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it, though, and get to know the characters, it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth, and a story about twins searching for their father, and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action, suspense, drama, and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war, and killings in the name of religion. What an absolutely fantastic script. This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in a while."
"'Wow, I never expected such an ending, so stunning, so wow. Denis did an excellent job.'"
"'World attention throughout much of this year has focused on uprisings in the Arab world. The Tunisian people forced the country\'s dictator to flee, and the Egyptian people overthrew Hosni Mubarak, while protests continue in Bahrain and Yemen.However, it\'s important to understand the roots of these uprisings. Denis Villeneuve\'s Incendies shows some examples. The movie focuses on Nawan Marwal (Lubna Azabal), an Arab immigrant in Quebec whose final wish is for her son and daughter to give some information to their father (whom they have never met) and their brother (who they never knew existed). So begins the children\'s journey to find out why their mother fled her native country.The native country is never identified, although it appears to be Lebanon. And in finding out what Nawan saw in her native country -- told in flashback -- we see some VERY ugly stuff. The movie leaves practically nothing to the imagination. But it\'s all part of the children\'s learning the family history. And certainly, the horror that Nawan witnessed should give the audience an idea of why the Arab world has been rising up for the past six months (in that respect, it probably would have been appropriate to give Incendies Best Foreign Language Film). Above all, it\'s a very good movie, although very gut-wrenching.Also starring MÃ©lissa DÃ©sormeaux-Poulin, Maxim Gaudette, RÃ©my Girard and Allen Altman.'"
"Twins journey to the Middle East to discover their family history, and fulfill their mother's last wishes.Many of us, sooner or later, get interested in our family history and want to know our roots. Do we have a famous ancestor, or do we have connections to an Indian tribe, or maybe something else completely unexpected. Often, the journey is fascinating and can spark a real interest in history and a connection to our fellow man.Sometimes the journey is not so good. Many of us have Middle Eastern blood in us somewhere. Go back a hundred generations and we can trace our path just about anywhere. And the Middle East, as a whole, is a great place... but this film shows what can happen if the path goes askew."
"Director Steven Soderbergh has gathered a cast of big name actors to do this scattered storyline virus movie. There is no doubt that these are brilliant actors, and Soderbergh has great skills who has done multi-storyline movies. However in this case, the people die off and we can't built any emotional attachments to the characters.Soderbergh does inject a sense of realism in this movie with the exception of the conspiracy blogger Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law). The realism has its own sense of thrilling suspense, but none of it is memorable other than an overall sense of dread. Maybe it's a little too much matter of fact."
"Initially I thought I was in for a horror movie without the scares. How many zombie movies start of in the same way, Ill person on train collapses, carnage follows, however, consider a film that substitutes the carnage for reasoned plot. In some ways Contagion felt like it could have been made as a TV drama, the threat is very, very realistic, as you watch you find yourself thinking this could really happen. Immediately after watching I bought a hand sanitizer and checked for bats :-) Surprising parts for Damon and Paltrow, but each perform very well. Overall it was more contained then I expected, that in itself makes it scary, that safe feeling you get knowing blood thirsty monsters are on the other side isn't here, instead are a series of events that cause real unease. A good watch."
"'Somewhere between it\'s Golden Globes win as Best Picture, and my sister\'s dismissal of the film as boring, lies the reputation of Brokeback Mountain as a film of significance. Prepared for either eventuality, I found the movie to have handled it\'s subject rather well, without being overtly or gratuitously graphic. As to it\'s greatness, that will be left to the test of time.The performances by the leads, as well as the supporting cast was realistic and engaging, lending credibility to the story. Director Ang Lee never ceases to amaze, with films as diametrically opposed as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hulk, and now Brokeback Mountain. Where does the creative vision for handling such themes come from?I can\'t say for sure if handling Jack\'s death within the story might have carried more force though, as opposed to it being dealt with in almost a flashback sort of way. Still tragic of course, but to my thinking, it would have guaranteed a more dramatic impact if done as part of the story in real time.Curiosity about the film prompted me to go see it; having done so I can say it was a worthwhile experience. It\'s good to see a controversial subject handled maturely and with creativity. Now let\'s see what Oscar says.'"
'A wonderful camping adventure. Great acting. Beautiful story.'
"'This film is about Harry Potter\'s sixth year at Hogwart\'s School for wizards.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince excels in visual effects. The various wizardry phenomena, such as the various Weasley\'s shop are visual delights. The pensieve and the process of memory retrieval are the most impressive.The plot concentrates on romance and jealousy, with little wizard battles or action. The plot as it is still could have been entertaining, but the delivery of it suspense or thrill. Even the final climax that evoked outcry from Harry Potter fans around the world seems plain and dry. That scene certainly could have been more thrilling and exciting.That being said, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is still adequate entertainment. I did not feel the film lasted for 2.5 hours at all, and I was actually surprised when the film ended, as I was expecting more.'"
"'This is a funny movie with a good premise where the leads work well together.

"Queen Elsa has a curse in that everything she touches turns to ice. Her sister Anna messes things up which leads to a roller coaster ride and a love story with a ton of Disney songs.I try to limit my Disney princess viewing. Since this film has become iconic in such a short period of time, and I have bought something from this film for every princess in my life, I had to watch it. I wasn't disappointed. Good fun."
"'This Disney effort is a delight from beginning to end. It is the story of a young princess who has a curse: anything she touches turns to ice. She can cause glaciers and formations to form just by the wave of a hand. When her parents die, she decides to completely isolate herself from her sister. They grow older on either side of a castle wall. When the castle is opened for the coronation, the younger sister, Anna becomes infatuated with a young prince and actually becomes engaged the same day. When Anna tells Elsa, she is furious and in the process she lets loose all her wintry power, running into the hills. The entire country is now frozen over and Anna\'s fiancÃ© is left in charge as she runs after her sister. So much has been written, so I won\'t retrace the ground already trod. If I could offer a layman\'s advice, it would be to focus more on the character of Elsa. She is the tormented soul who hides away, trying to deal with guilt and despair. She is certainly not unlike Simba in The Lion King trying to find some peace, trying to recover from intense guilt. The cast of peripheral characters are incredible. I found the snowman really wonderful as are the rock creatures who role in and take on the form of trolls. The music is wonderful (even though I can\'t escape some of the songs these days) and the dialogue and timing wonderful.'"
"'Ben Affleck directs, co-writes and stars in this riveting action-filled crime drama. The Charlestown neighborhood of Boston is known for turning out crafty armed robbers; generation after generation. Doug MacRay(Affleck)is a career bank robber planning his next hit. One of his crew is childhood friend Jim Coughlin(Jeremy Renner), who is quite volatile and obviously has a very short fuse. During the latest heist a bank manager Claire(Rebecca Hall)is kidnapped. Creating a major problem is the fact that Doug falls heavy for Claire thus causing doubts of judgment from mad dog Jim. That is not the worst; a head strong FBI agent(Jon Hamm)has MacCray and the recently fired bank manager under surveillance. Some very good car chases and gun battles. A strong supporting cast features: Pete Postlethwaite, Blake Lively, Owen Burk and Chris Cooper.'"
"'This film is about the life a big time thief after robbing a bank. He dates one of the victims in the robbery, while the FBI is on the hunt for him.The Town is not a conventional action thriller, as it has an actual plot. So many action thriller nowadays involve mindless violence and senseless explosions, but The Town has none of these problems. It has well developed emotional elements in the background of action. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is well portrayed and developed. It is interesting to see how their relationship is tested when the truth comes out, and it is satisfying to see how their relationship end up to be in the end.I find the middle parts of the film a little slow, but the ending parts make up for it. The Town is a reasonably entertaining movie, but I feel a little undecided on whether I liked it.'"
"OBLIVION is a great-looking addition to the wave of serious science fiction movies that have been filling cinema screens of late. It has wonderful vistas of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and although the screen is often full of CGI effects, they're handled very well and the overall result is a beautiful-looking movie.A shame, then, that all of the money and the visuals are wasted a little on a storyline that turns out to be rather clichÃ©d and predictable. OBLIVION takes a number of well known sci-fi tropes and mixes them all together in a somewhat unsatisfying mess; you know from the very outset the sort of thing that's going to happen here, and sure enough it does. It doesn't make for much in the way of entertainment, even if it is good spectacle.Tom Cruise stars in the usual everyman hero type role he's well known for, and he's not bad here; but none of the actors are required to do a great deal, which is a shame when there's genuine talent in the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets all of two lines, and Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko both look arresting but play rather one-dimensional characters. By the time you reach the second hour of this slow-moving production, all of what transpires will have been well telegraphed in advance, leaving this a somewhat hollow viewing experience."
"Kainan (Jim Caviezel) is an alien who crash lands on Earth bringing with him an animal called Moorwen of immense power. He must convince the local Vikings led by King Hrothgar (John Hurt) to join him to battle the creature. Love interest is played by Sophia Myles.There is some good action, and a good premise for sci-fi historical drama. It starts off relatively well. There is good action and good drama. The monster is revealed a little too early. They could have saved it for some place more powerful.Then there is the middle where the tension is almost all drained away. Kainan knows the creature is still out there, but he barely protests as the Vikings parties. It makes little sense. And Jim Caviezel isn't able to maintain any suspense there. It reveals one thing during the feast, but it's hardly worth the time wasted. I rather have more hunting action.The final hunt is a little muddled and too extended. After the big battle, it feels too repetitive. It seems anti-climatic to have the best action happen so much earlier. And the final blow isn't quite so great. I would have expected something more head chopping."
"'Having battled Nazis comically in Inglourious Basterds, Brad Pitt now does so seriously in Fury. He plays a staff sergeant commanding a Sherman tank through Nazi Germany. This movie shows World War II in its gritty details, although I admit that it probably doesn\'t compare to being in the midst of a battlefield. One of the most interesting scenes is when the platoon takes the town and spends some time with a pair of German women: it\'s a brief period of peaceful interaction between presumed enemies, just like the 1914 Christmas truce.It\'s a really good movie. There are some pretty intense battle scenes, but most importantly, the characters are people whom the audience can care about. In the end, I think that the countries that participated in World War I need to take a serious look at how the Versailles Negotiations precipitated World War II. In addition to the millions of lives senselessly lost in the WWI - not to mention the Armenian Genocide - the Versailles Negotations simply placed new colonizers in Africa and Asia, and destroyed Germany economically, setting the stage for Hitler\'s rise to power.Anyway, it\'s a movie that I recommend. Definitely see it.'"
"'Blood, guts, tripes, death. Here are the key words to describe this absolute masterpiece. The true face of war. Far ahead before PRIVATE RYAN. And also a tank movie as were BEAST OF WAR, in 88, and STEEL LADY, back in the fifties. Brad Pitt is here so poignant, so terrific and Shaia Le BÂuf has never been so good in a supporting character. The 135 minutes are not so long for the audience. And above all, SS troops are not shown as jerks. SS were butchers, assassins, beasts, yes, yes, yes, but certainly NOT jerks. The behaviour of one of them, at the end, is surprising and why not unbelievable. But why not? One last thing, the final battle begins in broad daylight and ends at night...But, again, why not?'"
"THE IMITATION GAME is an excellent piece of cinema that proves that there's still an audience for mature, thought-provoking drama. This is British cinema at its finest: superbly written and acted, which tells a series of historical events in an involving way that covers the broad spectrum of cinema.I love the background of spying and code-breaking so this film's subject matter was right up my street. Alan Turing is a portrayed as a tragic genius character, and Benedict Cumberbatch - although not one of my favourite actors - is perfect in the part. He delivers a character full of quirky mannerisms, whose sheer resistance to normality and likability makes him likable in himself.The two-hour running time flies past and every scene involved in the film adds to something. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who previously made the equally fantastic HEADHUNTERS, shows himself to be a powerful film-making force. The supporting cast are also great, in particular an irascible Charles Dance, MI6 head Mark Strong (thankfully not typecast as a baddie), and Matthew Goode (WATCHMEN) and Allen Leech (ROME) as Turing's companions. By turns moving, gripping, exciting, and heartbreaking, THE IMITATION GAME is a cinematic tour-de-force."

Alan Turing is a portrayed as a tragic genius character, and Benedict Cumberbatch - although not one of my favourite actors - is perfect in the part. He delivers a character full of quirky mannerisms, whose sheer resistance to normality and likability makes him likable in himself.The two-hour running time flies past and every scene involved in the film adds to something. Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who previously made the equally fantastic HEADHUNTERS, shows himself to be a powerful film-making force. The supporting cast are also great, in particular an irascible Charles Dance, MI6 head Mark Strong (thankfully not typecast as a baddie), and Matthew Goode (WATCHMEN) and Allen Leech (ROME) as Turing's companions. By turns moving, gripping, exciting, and heartbreaking, THE IMITATION GAME is a cinematic tour-de-force."
"'Sometime in the near future, muscular G.I. Joe team captain Channing Tatum (as Conrad Duke Hauser) delivers some warheads for the military. They can eat metal, and will devour entire cities unless commanded to stop. Very cool. Also cool are nanomites that boil in the necks of enslaved men. Helping Mr. Tatum is muscular sidekick Marlon Wayans (as Wallace Rip Weems). Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Rex The Doctor Lewis) goes from good to bad-ass. The beautiful and sexy Sienna Miller (as Ana The Baroness Lewis) kicks it with the beautiful and sexy Rachel Nichols (as Shana Scarlett O\'Hara). There are a lot of explosions, crashes, muscles and special effects.***** G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (7/27/09) Stephen Sommers ~ Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Sienna Miller, Marlon Wayans'"
"'Maybe back then you couldn\'t tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they\'d have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That\'s something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as Superbad obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea. After watching this, you might also be McLovin (this) ... no relation to any Fast Food chain by the way ...'"
"'I had the fortune to look behind the scenes of a puppet movie. The work and dedication that has to into a production is incredible. To make it work, to give the items (animals in this case) emotion and character is anything but easy. You have to care for them, laugh and maybe even cry with them.Something that this movie achieves so easily, it\'s almost frightening. Wes was not on set, but gave his ideas and opinions to the animators and they brought it to life. Many kudos to them, who admitted, not being used to work like that before. Great voice artist help elevate the really very good, fine dialogue further.A movie for almost everyone.'"
"'2009 was a great year for animated movies - first the excellent Up, now this sweet, beautiful, feel-good movie. Wes Anderson, director of such modern classics as Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, takes a Roald Dahl novel, and makes a superb movie out of it. Funny, witty, perfectly-paced, the plot and direction are spot-on. The animation is great and the choice of actors for the voices was inspired. George Clooney as Mr Fox is suave and sophisticated yet impishly naughty. Meryl Streep adds gravitas and motherly concern as Mrs Fox. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, ever-present in Wes Anderson movies, are perfect for their roles as the kid fox and the wise-cracking badger- lawyer, respectively. Even the minor parts have major names: Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Michael Gambon plus Jarvis Cocker (lead-singer of Pulp, in case you didn\'t know) as the folk-singing sidekick of one of the villains!All this, and then Wes Anderson\'s customary perfectly-chosen rocking soundtrack.It may be animated, but this isn\'t just for kids - it has something for everyone. A must-see: you won\'t be disappointed.'"
"Wes Anderson, a native Houstonian, makes quirky and interesting movies. Among his my favorite is 'Rushmore', made in Houston. Here he directs and has a hand in writing the extended adaptation of a storybook.George Clooney is the clever and fantastic Mr. Fox. We see him and Ms Fox get captured early, stealing birds, and he vows to go straight, get a legitimate job. So 2 years later (12 Fox years) he writes a newspaper column. Meryl Streep is Mrs. Fox. Jason Schwartzman is his young son, Ash. (Bill Murray voices the Badger and, perhaps not coincidentally, Murray and Schwartzman were the two principle actors in 'Rushmore'.)Other famous voices include Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean, Willem Dafoe as the menacing Rat, and my grandson's namesake, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip.But Mr Fox, and of course all the other animals, are wild animals. It is against their nature to go straight, and not steal chickens, geese, and apple cider from the farmers. So most of the movie pits the animals against the farmers. Mr Fox indeed turns out to be fantastic! The extras are interesting, especially as they relate to the animation used here, small puppets moved slightly between single frame shots. Much like claymation of the Wallace and Grommit movies."
"When I was in fifth grade a little over fifty years ago, I read a Weekly Reader article that stated that most great civilizations don't last much more than two hundred years. Obviously that article made quite an impression on me because I still remember it. From the vantage point of the late 1950's this would have seemed impossible for the United States, but as we cruise well past the two hundred year mark, it almost seems inevitable now doesn't it?Believe it or not, I looked this film up because Rush Limbaugh recommended it the other day on his EIB Network radio show. I can't believe he actually watched it, but then again, benefit of the doubt and all that. It could be he was inspired by the way the picture satirizes the way the government operates today, what with a House of Representin that's about as effective as Congress these days.Well left to my own devices, this isn't the type of picture I would generally pick up, given the premise and the cast. A single viewing was enough to convince me that I've hit my quota of dumb pictures for the year, and even once is too much with this one. Indeed, human evolution may be at a turning point, and this picture only reinforces that it's direction is down hill on a slippery slope."
"'A film about war, childhood, friendship, Shoah. inspired adaptation of novel by John Boyne. and little more. because the high virtue of film is its different angle to present the Shoah. and to impose not a special perspective but the most inspired.curiosity of a boy. and the war. a friendship. and the steps to discover the truth by Bruno and the emotions of viewer who knows it. it is a touching film. but, more important, useful. because it gives a honest portrait of a cruel episode. because Asa Butterfield is perfect as Bruno. and, after years, could not be a surprise. a film for understand the ash of a time. and to define for yourself essence of evil.'"
'Asa Butterfield (Bruno) is the 8 year old son of a Nazi SS officer charged with commanding a European concentration camp. There he befriends a young Jewish inmate (Schmuel) and slowly begins to challenge the indoctrination of the Nazis as they chat and play separated by a barbed wire fence. This most hideous of topics is handled subtly and delicately without avoiding the core horror and Nazi propaganda surrounding the holocaust and David Heyman has adapted John Boyne\'s book in a sympathetic and authentic way. There may well be factual inaccuracies but this is ultimately a story of compassion and a true coming of age and works well in that space.'
"Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a young boy living in wartime Germany. He is innocent of the world around him. His father Ralf (David Thewlis) gets promoted as the commander of a concentration camp. With mother Elsa (Vera Farmiga) and older sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), they move into a house off site from the camp. Bruno wonders why the farm workers are dressed in striped pyjamas. The kids get a tutor who teaches them propaganda. Their driver Lieutenant Kurt Kotler is a dedicated Nazi. Bruno sneaks out of the house and ends up at an isolated part of the camp's outer fence. He befriends Shmuel who is a boy prisoner inside the camp and visits him time after time. Their friendship grows as Bruno tries to understand the incomprehensible.This is really a fable rather than a historical reenactment. The point of the kids not understanding the situation is compelling at times but at other times seem silly. It may be better for Bruno to say less. Sometimes, his misunderstanding is poignant. The fact that he thought Shmuel was angry at him embodies both. The important subject requires more careful writing."
"'A few years ago, I went to a panel at New York ComicCon all about The Final Girls. The movie hadn\'t yet debuted but the cast and filmmakers were there to hype the production. I enjoyed the panel but forgot to see the movie...and finally got around to it tonight. And, it turned out to be a decent little film. And, when I say \'little\' it\'s because the film was low-budgeted and seemed to come and go rather quickly. Fortunately, the DVD is available through Netflix and it\'s worth your time.Before going on, it\'s important to note that I am talking about The Final Girls...not The Final Girl from 2010.The story is about a group of five friends who inexplicably get stuck in a bad 1980s slasher film. While they know what\'s going to happen, they have a heck of a time avoiding death and only a seeming miracle can stop the killing machine, Billy.The film is a combination of comedy and pathos. I wish the film had focused more on comedy but my wife disagreed and liked the mix. Regardless, the film has many clever moments and is a nice sendoff of the genre. Worth seeing. And, it\'s one of the few films that features outtakes at the end that actually ARE worth seeing.'"
"By minute two, I loved this movie and its originality. I loved the setup, the actresses, mainly my new girl-crush: Malin Akerman and the immediate homage to my childhood movies. ThenÂby minute 5, it shifted and I loved that originality. In fact, let's just say this film rarely let me down.It surely helped that slasher films are my favorite type of horror, not to mention 80s slashers and especially Friday the 13th are king to me. Also, I am very fond of Adam DeVine and the Comedy-Horror meshups, i.e. The Cabin in the Woods, Scary Movie and Student Bodies. So this movie hit all the points.And boy, was it funny. So hilarious at times, I was laughing thoroughly out loud during many of the scenes. It carefully covered the clichÃ©s without ever making them clichÃ©s themselves â as most of these movies sadly can't overcome, and gave us everything we needed from our slasher fix plus a real and sometime heartfelt story.I will NOT go into the plot or what the movie's about as I went into this movie completely blind. It's perfect to do just that as you never know what to expect.But, suffice to say, if you are a slasher fan, 80s or not and you like a spoof without actually reducing itself just to comedy bits this is the perfect film for you. I cannot see this NOT landing in my top three best list of the year."
"The big screen adaptation of the musical version of Les MisÃ©rables has Anne Hathaway knock it out of the park with an emotional version of 'I Dreamed a Dream.' Hugh Jackman shows that he can easily glide from action star to all round singing and dancing entertainer.

He spent years in jail and then more years hunted by the determined policeman Javert (Russell Crowe) for breaking his parole conditions.Valjean has become rich and successful and tried to do good for others. However he failed factory girl Fantine (Anne Hathaway) whose life descended in misery and prostitution. To make amends he takes care of her daughter Cosette. However Valjean cannot escape his past and France is heading for revolution.This is a big musical spectacle. Director Tom Hooper knows which big set pieces to stage for the cinema. Although the novel is long, the film is too long. Some of the songs are rather forgettable. I thought Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen were just a little bit too fruity."

"'Irving (Christian Bale)is a con artist. His wife (Jennifer Lawrence) is flaky so he has a mistress Edith (Amy Adams) who helps him in his cons. When she gets pinched by an eager FBI agent (Bradley Cooper as Richie) they are asked to assist the FBI with four arrests and then they would be let go. Irving reluctantly agrees and Edith helps against her better judgement. The plot leads us to Irving being involved in a bust of organized crime figures (Robert De Niro), something that would lead to his demise and that of everyone he loves. He is in over his head. During the film you know everyone is scheming, but who is going to come out on top?This is another classic con artist tale. It is a crime/thriller/drama/comedy. The acting was superb which made the script look substandard. Amy Irving is perhaps the sexist we have seen her to date. I never miss a film with Jennifer Lawrence who proclaims Thank God for me. Her role starts out minor but then grows. The ladies room kiss with Amy Adams is something I predict will be on loop.Seems like a good old fashion con artist film with some fine acting.Parental Guide: F-bombs. Brief sex. No nudity. Stripper with pasties, most likely Amy Adams body double as face is not shown with nearly bare torso.'"
"'This film tells the story of an FBI agent who works with two swindlers to bring down a large and powerful corruption gang in the government.American Hustle is very hyped as one of the best film of the year. With David O. Russell hot on the heels of his Oscar winner Silver Linings Playbook, and the super stellar cast involved, one rightly has high expectations on it. The actors are charming in their roles, especially Amy Adams whose character is a smart woman who plays both sides of the game. Bradley Cooper\'s character is energetic and wild, and he is also an interesting character in the film. However, I find the plot rather uninteresting. It drags on too long, and there the events are not portrayed intense enough. And I was annoyed by Christian Bale\'s character\'s hair.Maybe my expectations are too high, but I thought American Hustle was just an alright film, and certainly over-hyped.'"
"Grown Ups 2The best part of being a grown up is that you can buy alcohol for your under-age girlfriend.Thankfully, the adults in the comedy are married to fellow grown ups.Desperate to relive his childhood, Lenny (Adam Sandler) moves his wife (Salma Hayek) and children to his Connecticut hometown.Reunited with grade school buddies Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock) and Higgins (David Spade), Lenny plans to make this summer the most memorable.But for that to happen, the gang must endure a childhood bully (Steve Astin), rowdy frat boys (Taylor Lautner, Milo Ventimiglia), an estranged son (Alexander Ludwig) and angry wives (Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello).The unwarranted sequel to the awful original, Grown Ups 2 foregoes plot for the sake of puerile pranks perpetrated by formerly funny comedians.Besides, growing up doesn't mean you have to stop being a kid, it just means you can't be tried as one.Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
"'MARTYRS (2008) *** Morjana Alaoui, Mylene Jampanoi, Catherine Begin. A twisty turn tumble down the rabbit hole of torture porn in this disturbing and visceral tale of two young women attempting vengeance against years of torment ends up a tables turn into a grim, and bleak change of events. Filmmaker Pascal Laugier holds no punches with the graphic,brutal violence at hand nor does Alaoui in a true Final Girl turn for the ages.'"
"'It kinda starts like a normal home invasion by a psycho movie. That vibe is out there and everyone can feel that. Even the title does suggest it. But there is so much more. It actually juggles more than one genre to be exact, not to mention that it might leave you befuddled a bit by the end or even during the movie. On many things, like the main actor, who apparently was in Downton Abby. So if you know that show, his appearance here might shock you even more.The director cited a few inspirations (also from the Science Fiction genre) and having watched it through, it makes more than sense. There is a change of pace and it almost gets ridiculous towards the end, but I do love it. Just the central performance is so captivating, that it\'s hard not to feel entertained by the movie'"
"Adam Wingard superbly directs this dramatic blood-fest. A young, charming stranger named David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the home of the Peterson family claiming to be a friend of their late son, Caleb, killed in combat. They welcomed him with open arms, but soon things just don't seem right about him. And when a string of unexplained deaths comes to light, members of the family wonder if David even served with Caleb at all.Some of the scenes are jaw dropping and the sound helps keep your mind focused. Not a wasted moment and not a movie that has all of its ducks in a row. You can almost read David's mind before he goes into action; and yet most situations are not as predictable as you think. Blood, mayhem and suspense.Stevens is charismatic and Maika Monroe, as Anna Peterson, is very watchable. Also in the cast: Brendan Meyer, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williams and Leland Orser."
"'Here\'s a modern-day exorcist movie that is without the head-turning and pea soup, as Father Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins) puts it early in the movie.Without the gross stuff - although there are some scary and not-so-pleasant sights and scenes - it makes for a more intelligent look at the subject matter.Hopkins, no surprise, is excellent in his role at the veteran cleric who has been through many exorcisms. His antagonist, so to speak, is a young seminary student who extremely skeptical. (In fact, in real life, a guy with that little belief in God would never be in a seminary.). Anyway, Colin O\'Donoghue is good, too, in that role as Michael Kovak. Set mostly in Florence, Italy, the photography is nice and the story flows smoothly, building in intensity as it goes. It was very entertaining and is recommended.'"

"'This film tells the story of a rich paraplegic man in Paris, who gives a chance to a man who was just released from prison.Intouchables is a really touching and inspirational story. I really like the fact that both Philippe and Driss are so wildly different from each other, but yet they can complement each other and make each other grow. Philippe is cultured but reserved, while Driss is playful and hedonistic. I like the scenes where Philippe is selling the painting by Driss, the scene in the opera and the final scene. They complement each other so well, and they both treasure each other\'s friendship. It\'s a beautiful tale of mutual inspiration. I love it.'"
"'This film instantly draws you in with a real emotional connection to the characters. There is a good mix of humor and reality. The storyline has good flow, great acting, and vivid cinematography. Overall a well made film.'"
"'This film is about a family grieving for the loss of their murdered 14-year-old daughter, while the daughter observes their lives from a perfect land above.The Lovely Bones is so beautifully made. Susie, played by Saoirse Ronan, looks like a perfectly innocent angel. She instantly connects with viewers and her tragic events evoke much sympathy. How she sees the world she left behind and how she interacts with it is so moving. I particularly find the heaven sequences moving. Everything, including trees, sea and sky looks so perfect. Maybe, through these beautiful scenes, those who have gone through the loss of their loved ones might be consoled by the thought that their loved ones have gone to such a beautiful place.The Lovely Bones is also engagingly suspenseful. There have been so many times that I cannot help myself but shout at the characters to do or not to do something. I was very engaged and moved by The Lovely Bones, as it has all the ingredients to be a profoundly moving and heartbreaking tale.'"
"It's 1973 in a Pennsylvania suburb. Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan) is 14 years old living with her parents Jack (Mark Wahlberg), Abigail (Rachel Weisz), younger sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) and brother. She likes Ray Singh who slips a note into her book. As she walks home through the cornfield, she encounters her neighbor George Harvey (Stanley Tucci) who takes her into his underground hiding place. She escapes but eventually figures out that she's actually been murdered. School outcast Ruth lives by a sinkhole. That night, she sees Susie's spirit and finds Ray's note. Detective Len Fenerman (Michael Imperioli) investigates the disappearance and then her murder. Suspicions fall on Harvey but there isn't enough evidence. Holly is another Harvey victim who urges Susie to move on. The Salmon family struggles and Jack asks his hard-drinking mother Lynn (Susan Sarandon) to stay with them.The movie suffers from a mishmash of different tones. The serial killing is dark and horrific. Then there is the magical otherworld which needs to be much more creepy. It's too magical and not enough tension. Saoirse Ronan is terrific who keeps the movie upright. I don't even know what Sarandon is doing in the movie. This movie is trying to slam together a teen girl romanticism and a serial killer horror movie. The mashup doesn't really work but it is an interesting attempt."
"I watched The Maze Runner to see how much like or unlike Hunger Games it would be. By the trailer alone it looked very akin to the few, already released, dystopian flicks featuring teens (ala Hunger Games, Divergent, and even Ender's Game).I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was distinguished enough from the aforementioned movies and yet still good. As you probably guessed, the movie is about a maze. The movie starts off pretty intense. You are immediately thrust into the impending situation. It bodes well for the flow of the movie because you are experiencing everything as the main character, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), experiences it.The movie moves along at a nice pace and there was one particularly refreshing aspect. Most movies featuring a number of boys and teens have the typical issues: alpha male, the click, the outcasts, the new guy, et al. In this movie you saw these young men making a concerted effort to work together and put their egos to the side in order to survive. Thomas broke up the structure they had to some degree, but it wasn't without good cause.I liked the movie. It had a nice balance of intensity and mystery. The actors, and more importantly, the characters, were bearable. Not very often you see something like that."

"'Although Paul Feig\'s Bridesmaids is known as a chick flick, you have to accept the occasional crude humor to truly like it. I liked it. Melissa McCarthy\'s character is the really funny one, but Kristen Wiig certainly does some neat things, especially on the airplane. This is one of those movies that represents some of the best that comedy can be. It\'s true that there have been a ton of comedies centering on weddings, but this one knows how to time everything perfectly. It is, for lack of a better description, a very good movie, and you\'re sure to like it whether you\'re a man or a woman.And remember, be careful of food poisoning.'"
"'A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given better material to work with.When Wiig and her Saturday Night Live fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph, are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder why someone didn\'t think to give these two a buddy comedy along the lines of Baby Mama. But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig\'s character endures becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig\'s frantic efforts to wring comedy out of situations that don\'t lend themselves much to laughs.Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth sitting through.Grade: B'"
"'This film tells the story of a fairy who cast a spell out of revenge on the king\'s daughter, who will fall into eternal asleep on her sixteenth birthday.Maleficent has beautiful visuals. The fairy land scenes are beautiful, and the characters are beautifully designed too. Maleficent\'s look is cold and fierce, yet somewhat noble and not too scary for kids. I like the way the teenage Aurora bonds with Maleficent, it shows that there\'s good in everyone. Just trust and love the people around you, and the world will be a better place. It is an enjoyable story.'"
"I liked this reworking of the Sleeping Beauty tale by Disney as they focus on Maleficent the malevolent fairy in Sleeping Beauty,Here Jolie's powerful fairy has been betrayed by a boyhood human friend and she curses the baby princess more out of anger and wanting revenge for the loss of her wings.However as the King for some reasons after the curse abandons the baby princess to three inept fairies its up to Maleficent to keep the baby safe from a distance which includes making sure she is fed.The screenplay and story is not without problems, in fact its heavily flawed and might perturb younger viewers. The parents give the child to the three fairies who are clueless in raising a baby and seem to be criminally negligent which ceases to be funny.The humans are shown to be power hungry out to destroy the fairy world with Sharlto Copley's King being an uneven villain himself. He betrays Maleficent for his desire for power and Copley's accent is a cross between South African, Nordic and Scots.Its a light film with great sets and costume design, a flawed fantasy with a strong performance from Angelina Jolie who lifts the film and makes it better than it has any right to be."
"Given her penchant for appearing in things like Lara Croft, Salt, etc, and my preference for real films I have only seen Angelina Jolie in one movie, Changeling, in which I thought she was excellent. I think she also does a good job as the eponymous Maleficent where, coincidentally, an arguably finer actress than Jolie, Lesley Manville, is wasted in a joke role which is underwritten to boot. It's a nice take on The Sleeping Beauty though the song from the original Disney animated version, Once Upon A Dream may well be lost on younger viewers who were not going to movies in the early fifties - and while we're about it whose bright idea was it to drop Tchaikovsky's name as composer. The film is shot in somber tones so that even the few scenes that call for sunlight are muted. Definitely rates a look."
"'As far as I\'m concerned, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was more like Dorian Gray having a positive life.With his life in reverse, Brad Pitt, who played Benjamin, did an excellent job of conveying the problems of being born elderly but progressing through the years as a younger man. In the end, he has had a fulfilled life, but has to suffer the indignities of dementia as a young lad.The make-up artist for Mr. Pitt certainly deserved some sort of accolade, especially in his work with Pitt as an older man.A dying woman conveys the story to her daughter via a diary, and the young girl learns that Pitt was her father.There are other excellent performances by Cate Blanchett, as the woman who loved him dearly, and Taranji Henson, as the black woman who took him in and raised him in his elderly years.'"
"'The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.'"
"'... another Pixar hit. And it tastes and looks like one too! Concerning the latter: We\'re used that Pixar movies look good (other animation studios can keep up with the looks), but it\'s the story, the characters and maybe a magic ingredient, that differentiates Pixar from other studios ...So maybe Cars wasn\'t really Pixars best movie (it really wasn\'t, although if that\'s the baddest they get, than they don\'t have to worry at all!), but they made up for that with this movie. While the low expectations (mine) for a movie involving a car were met, some people might have been more than surprised, that the rat-story did work out! I can only recommend this very highly (doesn\'t matter if you\'re young or old, or even in-between), all you have to do is watch it ... unless you have a fear of rats and/or animated movies of course!'"
"Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Pixar/Disney animated feature film that should do very well at the box office in its opening weekend. Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching. So on that note, I definitely recommended it."
"From the makers of THE INCREDIBLES and CARS a comedy with a little of this and a touch of that and enough for seconds. Its a view of Paris that begins ...under the city. Remy(Patton Oswalt)is a determined rat with big ambitions of becoming a great French chef. Fate places Remy and his family in the Parisian sewer system right beneath a restaurant made famous by Remy's hero, Auguste Gusteau(Brad Garrett). Torn between his own dreams and his family's wishes, Remy and a hapless human pal named Linguini(Lou Romano)set in motion events that will have the elite of Paris diners clamoring for just a taste of new culinary concoctions.

The first half sets the scene for the dangerous mission, and it does so in an almost comedic style. The CIA has to choose the most unlikely and ridiculous cover for their mission, and it is so non-thriller like that it makes Argo almost like a spoof comedy. The second half is a real roller coaster ride, especially the critical scenes where there is only a fine line between life and death. The scenes are very well done, with so much tension and suspense that I was on the edge throughout the process. I liked Argo, and I can see it having crossover appeal to non thriller fans.'"

"Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) lives with his father Patrizio (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) after a stay at a mental hospital. His friend Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker) is also a patient. He is introduced to depressed widower Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) who is dealing by having casual sex. He reluctantly agrees to join her in a dance competition.As a rom-com, it's fun and functional. Cooper and Lawrence are two performers overflowing with charm. As a family drama dealing with mental illness, it doesn't hurt to have De Niro. As a comedy, it's got a few good laughs. What puts it over the top is Jennifer Lawrence. She's electric as soon as she shows up in the movie. She has some great exchanges with Bradley Cooper.If there is any complaint, it's that there seems to be some missing scenes that's usually needed in rom-com. The movie is already 2hrs long, so I can understand some scenes were trimmed. The deleted scenes section has the necessary bits. Check it out. This is definitely worthy of recommendation."
"'Predestination is a very good sci-fi film. I enjoyed it very much, but I should warn you...it\'s very strange and a bit confusing. This doesn\'t mean it\'s bad...it has lots of neat twists and turns and is worth your time.\nThe film is about a temporal agent (Ethan Hawke) who is blown up, but not killed, at the beginning of the film. After extensive surgeries and rehabilitation, he is sent on another case....in order to recruit a new temporal agent. When he meets this future agent, John tells his life story...which is very sad and weird. But if you think this is weird...just keep watching!The acting, writing and direction are all very good. I also enjoyed Sarah Snook and her dual roles. There really isn\'t any other film like it...and I will wrap it up quickly, as I don\'t want to ruin it for you by revealing too much of the plot.'"
"'I\'m not going to say much about this film, Predestination, except to say that if you\'re interested in time travel films, this is a must- see.Ethan Hawke gives a terrific performance, as does Sarah Snook.The film deals with time travel, looping, time dimensions, and much more as an agent is charged with stopping a bomber in the past who is going to bomb 11 blocks of New York City and kill 11,000 people.I consider myself fairly intelligent, and I like time travel movies, but they have to be a lot simpler than this one in order for me to follow it. My idea of time travel is Back to the Future or The Time Machine.I only had a partial idea of what this one was about. The very experienced viewers on Predestination\'s message board cleared up a few things.This film demands a second viewing. Intriguing and fascinating.'"
"I have to confess that l'd needed a twice of look to try to understand the plot and the proposal of this intriguing picture, starting in the middle of the story and going back, next to the future, this Australian sci-fi hold you and challenging you every time, the story is complex and contradictory, a different look of a time travel, Ethan Hawn whom is a fine actor is superb in this role, apart him and Noah Taylor the casting is practically unknown for us, intriguing and compelling movie that deserves a second chance who didn't like it!!!Resume:First Watch: 2017 / How many: 1 / Source: Netflix / Rating: 8"
"'Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, I\'m going to shoot you if you don\'t slow down. They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down. The drama teacher tells his students, I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson\'s horse...The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing\'s chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a track star while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity'"

"When I watched this third Iron Man movie with my movie theatre-working friend and his relatives, I had only previously seen the first one so it's possible I was partially confused by some of the characterizations that were portrayed in this entry in the series because of my not seeing the second one yet. Still, I did like many of the action scenes and some of the humor presented here as well as some of the twists concerning some villains and the fate of Pepper Potts. And Robert Downey Jr. is both intense and fun when playing the charismatic Tony Stark with Gwyneth Paltrow still bringing sparks as his loving partner, the aforementioned Ms. Potts. So on that note, I highly enjoyed watching Iron Man Three."
"Shane Black enters the The Iron Man franchise as co-writer and director and re-teams with Robert Downey Jr after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.Black brings a little hard steel to the sometimes silly Iron Man films as well as bringing a more focused mix of action and humour.Once again as it did in the first film we have a plot involving the military-industrial complex and terrorism which fuels it. We have a sinister, almost Osama Bin Laden type bad guy called The Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley whose later reveal as a druggie, out of work actor is rather inspired allowing Kingsley to put on a different more playful performance.Anyone who has seen previous Marvel films and the other Iron Man films could probably work out from the initial scenes who the ultimate baddie will be and along the way you have mayhem, destruction and Stark doing his own 'McGuyver' thing in the middle.This time Stark narrates the ongoing story and you have to wait for the post credits sequence as to who he is narrating the story to and once again Downey is the anchor who drives the film and has made the Iron Man films a success despite its flaws, although this is better than the last one which is a credit to Black."
"'It is easy to say than it is the best from the three parts. for story. for the portrait of Tony Stark. and for the not bad image of essence of politic. and, sure, not the last, for fireworks, heroism, dialogues, love story and performances. but the story remains the best thing. defining it not only as a lovely story about humanism and end of a too long age of a sort of Peter Pan.'"
"Depending on your cynicism-count you'll either view this as a great feel-good movie or Fantasy Island writ large. Consider: Robert de Niro is cast as the most perfect male since Jimmy Stewart in IAWL, the most lovable guy in town dispensing wisdom like ATMLs dispense tenners while Ann Hathaway is not only drop-dead gorgeous but has single-handedly built up an online fashion company from nothing to a place on the Big Board, is adored by her employees and adorable, not to say cute, small daughter and hasn't an enemy in the world. Conflict! What conflict. I've always found deNiro grossly overrated so it was Hathaway who drew me to this one and Yes, I did knowingly surrender to its charm and wallowed in its entertainment factor for the running time but that's not the same as dismissing the flaws."
"'Ben (Robert De Niro) is 70 and retired. He answers an ad for an Intern for a start up E-company that sells women\'s clothes. He says, I still have music in me. He quickly becomes an asset to the company and founder Jules Austin (Anne Hathaway) in a film formula way.Yes, the light comedy is predictable. It is a good date night film and it does turn into a romance as I once heard All the best pictures are romances. It is a feel good film that was well acted, directed, and written. One of the better of the plethora of films De Niro has done in the last few years And sometimes a feel good film is all we want.Guide: 3 F-bombs (one texted). No sex or nudity.'"
"'The supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man. But without a hero, he loses all purpose and must find new meaning to his life.Of the animated films in the last ten years, Megamind does not seem to get a lot of love. Which is a real shame. Because although it may be basically a Superman spoof, it is a very clever and very funny spoof. And with Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, it\'s hard to beat. (Jonah Hill could have been replaced.) Is it too late for a sequel? Because there really ought to be one, even if it seems that Despicable Me has the animated villain market covered.'"
"On the day of its premiere, my movie theatre-working friend and I decided to watch computer-animated Megamind this afternoon. The story seems to be another Superman parody/tribute as we see the origins of Metro Man (Brad Pitt) and the title character (Will Ferrell). Then when they've grown into the hero/villain they become, a reporter named Roxanne (Tina Fey) gets mixed in. But after that, many twists and turns come that take many humorous and even touching scenes entertainingly through a, what seems, a naturally organic plane. And they mostly seem to earn every highly amused and heartfelt emotion I got out of it all. And watching all those action scenes in 3-D added immensely to the experience. Kudos to all for a such wonderful experience provided to my friend and I. So yes, I highly recommend Megamind."
'I like the bit where he asks for a kebab instead of Turkish delight.'
"If you are cynic, you might wanna steer clear of this. On the other hand, I like to be cynic here and there, and I still did quite enjoy this movie. It's not the best movie ever (far from it), but as a feel good movie, with a hint of danger here and there (and actually an upset that is almost ridiculous), it works very good. Performances are more than stellar too.I haven't seen all the movies that came out in 2009 in America to qualify for the best actress award, but I guess the theme of the movie, helped Sandra win this one. Don't get me wrong, she is pretty good in the movie. But it's the overall impact of the whole thing, that made her win (is my guess).While it might also be the TV movie of the week, the naturalistic approach by our main actor does upgrade it quite a bit. His down to earth character works really well ... unless you think real conflict is missing in the movie ..."
"The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman (Sandy Bullock) and her family.The highlight of this film is the scene with S.J. serving as Michael's manager. That is pretty humorous, even if it is probably not close to accurate. (Heck, most of the movie is probably not accurate.) I watched this to check it off as a 2010 Oscar winner. Did Bullock deserve the award? Maybe, but all she really does is talk with a bad accent. We also get an interesting story about race, racism, and stark class differences. The message is not blunt, but maybe that is clever in a way... viewers can take away the message they want to take."
"Taken is a French thriller starring Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen. The screenplay was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, and directed by Pierre Morel. Neeson plays a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative who sets about tracking down his daughter after she is kidnapped by human traffickers while traveling in France.He sets on a frantic quest to rescue her after the young girl is abducted by slave traders in District B13.This is film provides a lot of fun and entertainment as a predictable action thriller.It's got all the attributes of a pleasurable action thriller - excitement, some undeniably enjoyable scenes and the absence of what it needs to be more memorable and more substantial.Also,a viewer is introduced to a new side of Liam Neeson, one that is relentless and likes to hit criminals in the throat and he makes this action movie engaging.That is why this is one excellent film despite of being far from a masterpiece."
"'This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.Taken has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it\'s full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. Taken is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced.'"
"'2012 is a science fiction disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich. It stars John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt, Thandie Newton, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson, among others.Disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012. When a global cataclysm thrusts the world into chaos, divorced writer and father Jackson Curtis (Cusack) joins the race to ensure that humankind is not completely wiped out.He attempts to bring his children, Noah and Lilly , ex-wife Kate Curtis and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman to refuge and attempt to escape the heightened change in the elements. The movie provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.It is basically a total popcorn entertainment with ridiculous dialogue and impossible situations and special effects that will boggle the brain for a good two-plus hours.'"
"'2012 is actually one of the best disaster movies to date in my opinion. Sure it had a very generic and predictable storyline, but the visual effects outshines all other disaster movies. And that alone makes it well-worth watching this movie.And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.Story-wise, well, then 2012 was as every other disaster movie ever made. Mankind stares total annihilation in the face and stands triumphant against impossible odds. Yes, a very generic storyline and one that has been used countless other times in just about every other disaster movie.They had put together quite a good cast for the movie. Of course it was Woody Harrelson who outshines everyone with his performance as the oddball Charlie. But I will also say that John Cusack did quite well in this movie, despite being well out of his usual arena of movie genres. Oliver Platt was also quite good in this given role.I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and every time I am equally blown away by the impressive CGI effects that are shown in 2012. This movie is a definite must watch for any fan of the disaster movie genre.'"
"As is the case with most disaster films, there are excellent special effects here. Imagine, the South Pole moves into Wisconsin!The picture itself is one big clichÃ©. We have a family trying to escape the turmoil. What makes it ironic is that the couple are divorced and they're fleeing along with her current husband. With renewed love and anxiety, you know where this is going.Of course, we see cohesiveness and respect for our fellow human beings as the story unfolds. Naturally, there is Oliver Platt, a government official who is mainly out for his own survival under the guise of the fact that government must continue.Our own U.S. President succumbs for humanity. The kids do a lot of screaming as the world geologically falls apart. This is 2012, wait until the presidential election!"
"As the resistance grows, Katniss is driven to exact personal retribution from President Snow. But Snow still has some tricks up his sleeve, all is not as it seems, and Peta still bears the scars of his brainwashing.And so The Hunger Games reaches its conclusion, the third book having been stretched into two movies, as is the fashion koff moneygrubbing instincts of Hollywood. This has been a dark series, and so the final film is probably the darkest (to some extent, literally â the wholly unnecessary 3D means that there are times when it is almost unseeable, though never unwatchable). And, I am pleased to report, the inherent darkness is not abandoned in favour of a conventional happy wrap-up. Matters are resolved satisfactorily, but not necessarily happily: PanEm has been through too much to be happy for quite some time.Katniss is an interesting character: always (necessarily) strong, but never particularly likable, this has been a good character and series for Jennifer Lawrence, during which we have seen her career progress from promising newcomer to supremely talented all-rounder. And in this final part she gets her best scene of all: a scene on a par with Josh Hutcherson's final scene in episode 3, whereby the audience is shown what this experience has done to the characters.This is a strong finish to a good series."
"Since Pixar has taken over creative control over Disney projects, they have gone up. Not only financially but also creatively. And it shows in the outcome of this movie too. While there might be a musical number or two too many in this one, they are still pretty rare. And if you can endure them, you will be treated to a very funny movie. With animals that might not sing (or talk for that matter), but do have a mind of their own nonetheless.And it's the animals that almost outshine the human (drawn) cast. But while the story is predictable, you will find yourself cheering for the all the right reasons (if you are not too pessimistic that is, of course). Or too cynical. It was the last movie I watched in 2010 in cinemas and I was not disappointed!"
"There was once a time where I wasn't crazy about horror but over-time I have grown to appreciate it. Halloween really is a true classic of its genre, it is genuinely scary, taut and is pretty much the only movie of the franchise in my opinion that is not only truly effective after all this time but also where everything works.Halloween is very well made for starters, with atmospheric lighting and camera angles definite things to like. The score is resolutely haunting, the story is tightly paced and compelling, John Carpenter's direction is superb with some inspired, efficient techniques and while I have heard better the dialogue is good enough with some sharpness and nothing really that stands out as too cheesy or stilted.The acting is very good, and the characters especially Michael Myers are iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis is more than just a pretty face, her acting seems very genuine and she gives her character welcome gravitas. Donald Pleasance is excellent too, while Michael Myers as a character is the personification of terror.Halloween also works so well because of its atmosphere. It doesn't rely on excessive and cheap gore to make its point, or frenzied camera angles and the like. What it has is real suspense and genuine jolts especially in the last twenty minutes.All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"I was never part of the cult following for this film. I saw it nearly 30 years ago. I went after midnight with a roommate and found the experience quite interesting. I don't criticize people for enjoying life and having fun with something like this. God knows, life can be boring at times and whatever puts a smile on your face and gets you through another day is OK with me. The movie itself is unlike anything I've seen. The songs are clever and over the top. From Tim Curry on down it is one strange kick after another. It is, of course, filled with every representative of what came to be the GLBT experience. It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later."
"'The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla\'s best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various \'circumstances\' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his business over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn\'t notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.'"
"Youthful energy. That's what this is -- and what it is about.Spacek, King and Depalma are all at their most committed exuberance. Sometimes callow, but sometimes so rawly honest one often tingles quite apart from the story. See it on this basis alone. DePalma's  camera has a sense of dance -- Scorcese does too, but DePalma's is more emotional. Spacek is so clean in her acting that her ability frightens. How strange it went away, like a poltergism.The story has a haunting tone, also centered on youth and yearning. Menarche as a horror, the innocent acceptance/fear of the basest religion, the brash director intelligently spoofing Hitchcock. Odd mix that, so an odd and intriguing experience."
"'Carrie - probably more than any other movie - shows that even in the worst situations, we\'ve all got the power in us; granted, most people probably don\'t have telepathy.Anyway, this first adaptation from a Stephen King novel was done perfectly, with Sissy Spacek as the mousy but deadly Carrie White. Everyone in the movie does a top-notch performance: Piper Laurie as Carrie\'s disturbed, fundamentalist Christian mother Margaret; Betty Buckley as gym teacher Ms. Collins, who befriends Carrie; William Katt as the clement Tommy Ross, taking Carrie to the prom; Nancy Allen as the despicable Chris Hargenson, wanting nothing except to brutalize Carrie; Amy Irving as the circumspect Sue Snell; and even a young John Travolta as Chris\' crony Billy Nolan.The most famous scene is of course the prom scene, where Chris and Billy go a little too far in their vile plans, leading Carrie to do something that no one will ever forget. And believe you me, you won\'t forget it either. You shouldn\'t forget it, because Carrie is one movie that everyone should see. 10/10.'"
"'While neither me nor Mom remembered this very first James Bond movie much because of how long ago either of us had last seen this, we both remember some of the scenes. Mom noticed there wasn\'t much action compared to subsequent ones and I thought it was slow the first time I saw this. But it\'s still pretty exciting to watch and how awesome to see the first time that gun barrel animation that always begins the JB movies is first presented as well as the first time that theme plays, the first time Sean Connery says Bond, James Bond, and the first time we also meet M and Miss Moneypenny! Add in Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, Joseph Wiseman as the first villain as referred to by the title, and Jack Lord (pre-original Hawaii Five-O) as the first of several Felix Leiters and you\'ve got a treat of the initial entry in the James Bond series! So, yes, that\'s a recommendation.'"
"Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time, I really discovered quite a few things, by watching it. So even if you have seen it, you can watch it again and again!"

"'Over 30 years later this film still provides a ton of laughs to audiences.It\'s always good to see the late Marty Feldman, whose face was hysterical and perfect for this film. In fact, he, along with the camera-work, really make this film one to watch and enjoy multiple times. Teri Garr was at her best and never looked as pretty as did in here. Add in the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hackman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, etc., and you have a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes.Looking at the Frankenstien monster in a tuxedo or sitting up in bed with a cigar reading The Wall Street Journal are just a few of the outlandish scenes, along Wilder entering the mansion commenting on the nice knockers.Kudos, also, for Mel Brooks having the good sense to film this in black-and- white. It may have been his best film, although Blazing Saddles would give it a run for its money. My only complaint was Wilder\'s constant yelling, which becomes abrasive and can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be considered one of the best comedy classics ever.'"
"'I would be hard-pressed to find another comedy with a cast this good. Everyone--Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr, Gene Hackman, Kenneth Mars--sparkles in their own realm of dementia here, especially Wilder, whose brand of mayhem uncorks at whim and sometimes sends us scurrying for cover! It\'s a very funny--and yet serious--spoof of the Frankenstein movies, with humor that derives from our nostalgia and the set replicas as much from the dialogue. The plot is (intentionally) familiar, but the script isn\'t always so predictable, throwing the audience a curve-ball now and then. The jokes range from terrific to terrible, yet the cast and director/co-writer Mel Brooks almost always manage to keep the movie on track. Wilder teamed with Brooks on the screenplay, and there was a small feud about who did most of the work; consequently, they never did another picture together. It was their loss as well as ours, for despite some OK films (Wilder\'s The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\' Smarter Brother and Brooks\' High Anxiety), neither reached the heights they climbed with Young Frankenstein. *** out of ****'"
"Spoofs are ten a penny these days but Young Frankenstein had so much care and attention put in by Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder. It was fresh and innovative.What works is the atmosphere, filmed in Black and White and evoking the sets, location of the Universal 1930's Frankenstein films.You are easily brought into the atmosphere which gets regularly punctured with jokes, one liners and visual jokes such as the enormous knockers on the door as they arrive at the castle.The cast of Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Terri Garr milk the laughs for all its worth.Gene Hackman is a hoot as the blind hermit which sends the monster scurrying after he offers cigars. Feldman's Igor is the best and both Kahn and Garr are sensual and sexy.Almost 40 years later, it is still mad and funny."
"Mel Brooks makes one of the best parody films ever with this comedy about the gradnson of Dr. Frankenstein (Gene Wilder is terrific) who inherits his grandfather's mansion.  He like his old man is also a doctor, and sees he has a new assistant, Igor (pronounced as eye-gor in perfection by Marty Feldman).  But soon, he is enfatuated with a book his grandfather wrote (How I Did It) and creates a monster.  Hilarious escapades in this goofy yet quotabe comedy parodying all the frankenstein movies and even creates some Brooksfilm cliche's.  Very funny every time I watch it.

"'George Lazenby took on the mantle from Sean Connery for this 007 outing and I think he did quite a decent job with this, more convoluted story. He takes on the guise of an heraldry expert sent to Switzerland to investigate and validate the claims of lineage of Telly Savalas, purporting to be the Count de Beauchamps - defined by lack of ear lobes, don\'t you know - but who really has plans to use a form of hypnosis to achieve world domination. This film has a bit more class and less innuendo that it\'s earlier iterations - and Diana Rigg adds a bit of mischief and panache as the boisterous, independently-minded Tracy with whom poor old James has a pretty torrid time. This story isn\'t so good, but that isn\'t Lazenby\'s fault - indeed I felt that he, Rigg and Savalas tried hard to create a sense of suspense and menace; as did Ilse Steppat as the no-nonsense Irma Bunt (is that an anagram?). A great Louis Armstrong song, too - what\'s not to like - it\'s a shame that Messrs Broccoli and Saltzman didn\'t give George another kick at the ball with a better screenplay.'"
"'Alright, let\'s just be boring and say that The Exorcist is still f***ing chilling to the bone. Shots that William Friedkin designed from paintings (like the shot of Max von Sydow\'s Father coming to the house in silhouette and seeing the lone light beaming out from the bedroom window), and taking from some based on a true story stuff from writer William Peter Blatty that the director shoots like a documentary is what sells it for me, for us, for the world. It could be said, argued, that after years of parodies like in the \'Scary Movie\' movies that the effect of seeing a little girl spewing green puke and rancid curses in the voice or 70 year old chain smoker Mercedes McCambridge isn\'t scary as it used to be.But the (surprising) fun of the Exorcist, and the dread, is that Friedkin doesn\'t back down from taking this seriously, and with an intensity that is unshakable. The acting is so naturalistic, yet still the actors giving screen performances (and it\'s people like Ellen Burstyn and von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb, you can\'t go wrong there), and there is a bit of mythology too â in maybe the only slightly over-long sequence at the beginning where the older Father goes about old ruins in Iraq to findÂ spooky thingsÂ as they say, the devil\'s in the details. And this is still the film to beat when it comes to stories of demonic possession, by far.'"
"The horror genre is a genre that has been growing on me overtime, and I genuinely believe The Exorcist is a landmark of it. Not just how much it's talked about or parodied, but also its ability to unnerve and unsettle me even years later. The Exorcist is a fantastic film, both as a film of its genre and of film full-stop. The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn. Overall, genuinely unsettling and effective. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"'Aside from a couple of dull stretches, involving of all people, a surprisingly insipid Britt Ekland, this is both an exciting and amusing effort incorporating some great action sequences and a suspenseful, edge-of-the-seat climax which even tops the movie\'s exciting opening with Marc Lawrence. Admittedly, Bernard Lee\'s M is getting a bit too perfunctory, but the other characters are well played (although Richard Loo\'s voice is a bit odd â maybe it was dubbed). Christopher Lee has a really great time as the villain, and let\'s not forget the super-lovely Maud Adams. Fortunately, there\'s not so great an emphasis in this installment on crazy inventions and effects. Indeed, the approach to these standard Bond items is welcomely tongue-in-cheek. Instead, the movie concentrates on the exotic locations in Macau, Honk Kong and Siam, all of which are used as exciting backgrounds for some marvelous chases and action material. Admittedly, the scenes involving the American tourist are a bit heavy-handed but Ossie Morris\' sharp deep-focus location photography overcomes much â even the dull work of Ted Moore who obviously photographed the more routine studio interiors. Sets of course are a major asset, as usual, and the music score has plenty of zing. Production values are first-class. Admittedly, Hamilton\'s direction is no more than competent, but he knows when to give Morris and the location directors their heads â and that\'s the name of the game!'"
"Roger Moore as James Bond is targeted by the world's greatest assassin Scaramanga(Christopher Lee). All the expected new gadgets are there; some real decent car chases; awesome locales and the obligatory eye catching women like Maud Adams and Britt Ekland. This 007 episode works hard, but still leaves an empty feeling. Lee's talents are wasted. Moore is growing into the role of the super spy Bond. In support are Richard Loo, Herve Villechaize and Clifton James. Be careful where you point that thing."
