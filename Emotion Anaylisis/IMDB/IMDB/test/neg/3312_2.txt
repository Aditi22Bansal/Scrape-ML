['"Disaster Movie" was a horribly unfunny and pathetic film. Likewise, "Epic Movie" is also horribly unfunny and pathetic...but at least it was slightly better! Unlike "Disaster Movie", this one actually had two or three laughs--very small laughs, but laughs nonetheless.Like "Meet the Spartans", "Disaster Movie" and 174 other recent movies, this one is a rapid-fire parody of many recent movies. And, like all these other films, it\'s mostly crappy--with very few laughs. The jokes are rapid-fire but unlike the original film of this type, "Airplane", the jokes never worked. They would have been better off in hindsight to just stop making these sort of terrible films a lot time ago but they have continued for one reason alone--many teenagers are so stupid and sheep-like that they\'ll go see anything!!! Nothing else could explain the proliferation of these crap-tastic films.Some of the parodied films include "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe", "Harry Potter", "X-Men", "Snakes on a Plane" and "The DaVinci Code" and it could have been funny. The problem, however, is that the writing was absolutely pathetic and it truly appears as if no one cared. After all, not giving a darn is the only way that would explain how a Harry Potter parody has not a single laugh! Overall, a bore-fest with lousy writing, acting and direction that appears as if the director was just punching a time clock--hoping the unfunny mess would just finish itself quickly so they could go on to the next slap-dash production.']
