['"Gunday" follows a familiar territory of best friends turning foes for their common love. What follows is an action packed story of petty thieves turning into the city\'s biggest outlaws and a cop relentlessly following the criminal duo. Such stories used to be favorite among the \'70s film makers. Story-wise, the film isn\'t more than an average \'70s action film full of improbabilities. You can\'t just digest Ranvir Singh and Arjun Kapoor as the most notorious bandits of Calcutta in the 80s as the film projects nor the police action against them looks much realistic. Overall, "Gunday" is weak in its story with unlovable characters and tastelessness. Performance wise too, the film falls short for the under performed roles of Irfan Khan and Priyanka Chopra. If the film grips a little, it\'s for the fast pace and the technical aspects of the film.Rating: 1 star out of 4']
