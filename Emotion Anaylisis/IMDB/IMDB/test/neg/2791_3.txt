['This film is about several actors filming for a failing Hollywood war production in the middle of a real war zone.I did not find this film as funny as people claim. Many jokes fall flat. Jack Black makes exaggerated shouts and moves all the time, which is annoying rather than funny. The "Simple Jack" joke was not funny, it\'s just plain silly. I find it hard to believe that "Simply Jack" happens to be the only film the Vietnamese drug lords have seen. Isn\'t that too much of a coincidence? Having a child to lead a drug gang is in fact sad. References to Jennifer Love Hewitt and Lance make bring a small giggle, but that\'s it. I think this film had so much promise with the interesting idea and a stellar cast. But unfortunately it did not work for me.']
