['....but it would not be Ian Fleming\'s saga for long.The first four films used to follow the novels -with the exception of "thunderball" which ,although close to the book,actually came from an original screenplay:hence its remake in 1983-,then the following episodes only kept the titles...And when there were no more titles ,the script writers had to invent new ones ,Ã\xa0 la Ian Fleming (Goldeneye,etc).The first four Bond were arguably the best and it\'s always interesting to compare them with the books,which we cannot do anymore from "you only live twice" onwards.At the time ,the writers were timid self-conscious guys;they did not dare to include the "crabs scene":Honeychile \'s naked body is handed over to big crabs!Two years later,they would not be afraid to show Jill Masterton \'s golden girl scene ,even if that scene was only told by another character (Tilly Masterton)in the novel."Dr No" is still tentative ,but compared to what the saga became later,it is commendable stuff.']
