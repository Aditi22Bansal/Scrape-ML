['Damn I wish I woulda checked the credits first. Had I known Hayden Christensen was in this movie I definitely would not have tuned in. Is there anything that he is in that isn\'t ruined by his presence? "Jumper"... Human version of X-Men\'s Nightcrawler. I guess the fact that these "paladins" hunt the Jumpers was to make it more exciting, but really it was still lame. I mean honestly, if these guys can jump anywhere and get anything, then certainly they can grab a gun and shoot any one of these paladins, right? I, personally, was rooting for the paladins. The only jumpers shown were self serving, narcissistic, greedy criminals. People like that get arrested in real life. Not everyone can just take what they want when they want it, we actually have to work to earn money and vacations and such. This movie was only mildly entertaining and only because of the CGI. Take away the CGI and this movie is a 100% flop instead of the 60% flop that it was.']
