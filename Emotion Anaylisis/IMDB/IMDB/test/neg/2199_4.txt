['A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed "The Zodiac" is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who\'s employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper\'s reporting of (and the police department\'s concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith\'s non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it\'s quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****']
