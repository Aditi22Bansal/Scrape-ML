["Intriguing and original plot...that, unfortunately, goes nowhere.The story of a man who spots someone identical to him in a movie. Puzzled and bored he tracks him down. Intrigue ensues...This initial setup gives Enemy a very interesting start. The intrigue continues throughout the movie. Unfortunately, however, it appears that the writer hit upon a great and original plot...and then didn't know what to do with it. The movie ultimately goes nowhere, ending bizarrely and anticlimactically. It starts as a Christopher Nolan movie, ends as a David Lynch movie. (Thankfully, at least it doesn't have the length or pretentiousness of Lynch's last few movies).Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a good performance in the lead role. The two identical people don't have the same personality, making his performance even more impressive, as he had to play two different people.Having written and directed the excellent Incendies in 2010 and directing the even-better Prisoners in 2013, Denis Villeneuve can be forgiven for missing the mark for once. Still one of the more exciting directors to emerge in the last few years."]
