['A strong willed female saloon owner (Joan Crawford) is wrongly suspected of murder and bank robbery by a lynch mob, when she helps a wounded gang member.I can see why this western has something of a cult status. Certainly an outlaw who has a guitar strapped to his back rather than a gun makes for an interesting character. And it asks that age old question: can a leopard change his spots? Can Johnny Logan become Johnny Guitar? Joan Crawford leads the film, apparently because she helped produce it. For the life of me, I never figured out her appeal. Her acting is good but no great. She is no joy to look at. And from what I understand, she was more or less a terror to everyone around her. How did she ever get to be as big as she was?']
