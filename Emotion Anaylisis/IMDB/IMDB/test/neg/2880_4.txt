['You know how everyone describes Steve McQueen as "cool"? Well, "The Great Escape" shows why. As Capt. Virgil "The Cooler King" Hilts, trying with several other POWs to escape from a Nazi camp, he tunnels his way to coolness. Of course, he isn\'t the only character. There\'s visually impaired Flight Lt. Colin "The Forger" Blythe (Donald Pleasance), action-ready Flight Lt. Bob Anthony "The Scrounger" Hendley (James Garner), flippant Flight Officer Louis "The Manufacturer" Sedgwick (James Coburn), Flight Lt. Danny "The Tunnel King" Velinski (Charles Bronson), and others. Obviously, the setting didn\'t look too realistic (one would expect a POW camp to be a little dirtier than the one here), but either way, this is a cool movie.']
