['This film tells the story of the people in Sin City, and their violent and corrupt ways of life.I wondered what a graphic novel was, it turned out it is a film with a lot of narration like a novel has. Instead of describing with a scene, they describe with words. It\'s an interesting concept, but the story doesn\'t work for me. The violence is so over the top that it made me laugh. The scene of a man with an arrow through his body is completely hilarious, and I\'m not even sure if that\'s the intended effect.The black and white effect with some specks of color may be cool at the time of release, but by now I have seen it all before so I am not as impressed with it as I expected. One thing I was very impressed with was Jessica Alba\'s dancing. I knew she could dance from the film "Honey", but this time she can really dance amazingly."Sin City" will appeal to some, but not to me.']
