['strange situation. because each adaptation of Bible books is a courageous and not really inspired idea. it is not a single Christian Church and it is not a single way to live Christian faith. each adaptation is a challenge. and , in same measure, a dangerous exercise. this mini-series is special- common case. it is special for its ambition to say all story with poor instruments. it is common because this is ordinary manner of Protestant cults to promote its vision. it is a condensed version, maybe, too condensed in few parts. the acting, in many cases, is formal. and the impression is to watch a run to Jesus story, to discover episodes as flashes, good for the viewer who desires remember his basic religion knowledge but not for attract members of others religions. it is not a documentary - drama, it is not an artistic film, it is not bad or good, inspired or boring. it is only a decent mini-series. nothing more. is it enough ? maybe, as instrument for memory or for re-read the Holy Book.']
