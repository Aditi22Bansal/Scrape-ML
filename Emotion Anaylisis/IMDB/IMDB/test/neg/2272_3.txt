['. . . such as, "What IF Satan is Real?" and "What IF the Devil always has been Top Dog in the U.S.?" THE WITCH shouts a resounding "You Betcha!" in answer to both questions. If THE WITCH\'s viewpoint is correct, it certainly would make a few turns of events easier to understand, such as the unparalleled Genocide wiping out 90% of 837 Native American Nations, Black Slavery, The Civil War, Concentration Camps for the Japanese, John Wayne\'s anti-Semite Witch Hunts, and Trump in the White House. Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson\'s THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It\'s as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal. This film does more to show Evil Triumphant than any movie Hitler\'s Videographer, Leni Riefenstahl, ever churned out. The only caution to be made is that THE WITCH seems to have emanated from Satan\'s Playground, a.k.a., Canada.']
