["For the sake of this review I watched the entire movie, but I've got to say, it was a chore keeping my attention on the story. Criterion really dropped the ball on this one, they should have provided captioning for those of us who only speak English. I hardly understood a word spoken in the film, but I held out hope that the basic premise would reveal itself the way it has in other movies that I've had trouble following. No such luck. This thing started out way over the top and wound up just utterly stupid. I generally enjoy good parody but this seemed more like goofy slapstick. Could be I'm missing something because this gets a lot of credit by IMDb fans who's voting keep it in the Top #250. Maybe I'll try it again if I can find a copy with captioning, I'm open minded enough to give it another go. For now, my only positive takeaway was the Roman Centurion garb, those guys looked pretty sharp."]
