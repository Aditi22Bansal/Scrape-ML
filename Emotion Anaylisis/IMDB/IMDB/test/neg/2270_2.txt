["the reason i give this show one star, is because there is no negative stars rating, seriously, its that bad, not enough that he whole premise of the show is weak, 90% of it revolves around the sordid love life of a 16 year old who has two hunks in love with her, a bunch of friends, a cool mom, super powers, and yeah..she is the one, Bella swan much? when will Hollywood stop profiting from the shallow and vain egos of American teen girls, can we have a show with some substance? would it kill them if the hero actually had to earn his status through some hardship and humility? and to top this off the ending is the worst cliff hanger of all time, with no second season even confirmed, and even if there is to be a second season of this insult to anyone with taste, the ending is still God awful. my advise don't waste your time, i did that for you so you wouldn't have to. cheers."]
