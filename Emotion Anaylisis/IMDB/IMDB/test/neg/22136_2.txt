["This show is just wild from the start to the finish. Home zoo owners from across the country are interviewed about their stories, and it's just indescribable the weirdness they get up too. The show itself has a lot of material since Joe Exotic films every aspect of his life. The first few episodes are crazy, and good, and then the show tries to get serious and it losses some charm. With Joe's conviction, the interviews are haphazard and there's no coverage of the trial, making the last episodes feel amateurish."]
