['David (Shiloh Fernandez), his drug-addicted sister Mia (Jane Levy) and his friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) travel to an isolated cabin that belonged to his parents to spend a couple of days together. Mia promises to stop using drugs and Olivia, who is a nurse, promises to help Mia in her abstinence. They discover a hidden basement with witchcraft and the Book of the Dead, and Eric reads it and unintentionally summons an evil force. Mia, Olivia and Natalie are possessed by evil and Eric reads the book trying to learn how to destroy the demon."The Evil Dead" (1981) is a classic horror movie by Sam Raimi and his debut and beginning of his successful career. Despite the low-budget, Sam Raimi made a scary movie, using an original camera work and simple scenario."Evil Dead" (2013) is a stupid and gore remake with awful situations. Why four friends would bring a drug-addicted to the middle of nowhere instead of to a clinic? Why should they live the car keys and a shot gun close to a person in crisis caused by abstinence of drugs? The corny relationship between David and Mia is also awful. The movie is never scary, but boring and disgusting with excessive gore and mutilations. I was deceived by the IMDb Rating. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): "A Morte do Dem√¥nio" ("The Death of the Demon")']
