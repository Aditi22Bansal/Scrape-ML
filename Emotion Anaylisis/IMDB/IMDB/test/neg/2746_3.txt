["Though the intrepid three heroes of Star Wars destroyed the Death Star commanded by Darth Vader, the rebel army is still on the run. They've taken refuge in a frozen planet called Hoth much like George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge. In the meantime the Empire still searches for the rebel army in The Empire Strikes Back.When the attack comes, it comes full force, the rebels flee as do Luke Skywalker and R2D2 in one ship and Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C3PO. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker is given a mission in a dream by the late Alec Guinness, killed in the first Star Wars film to receive Jedi Knight Advanced Training from the legendary Yoda and he seeks him out. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher and company seek out Ford's old friend Lando Kalrissian to repair his ship after Ford plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with Darth Vader's battle cruiser.As Lando Kalrissian, Billy Dee Williams steps into the Star Wars pantheon of heroes and proves quite useful if not quite on the up and up. George Lucas continues his tradition of writing about futuristic Homeric like heroes in a galaxy far away. And as cinema, The Empire Strikes Back continues the quality of excellence that the original set. Looks like the Force is definitely with George Lucas."]
