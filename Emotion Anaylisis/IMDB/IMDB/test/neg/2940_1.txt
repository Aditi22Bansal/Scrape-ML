["When I was young I used to love this cartoon, a lot more than the live action version with Glenn Close (although that was good too). Two lonely bachelors lived in London, a dog and a man. The dalmatian dog, Pongo, is the centre of attention. One day they both meet girlfriends and get married. Later the female dog, Perdita, has fifteen dalmatian puppies. A horrible woman named Cruella De Vil has terrorised the family and now kidnapped the puppies, with the help of Horace and Jasper, to make a puppy coat for her fur collection. A very good Walt Disney Pictures animated cartoon with some action, some laughs, and some cute puppies. I didn't actually know that Rod Taylor from The Birds did the voice of Pongo! It won the BAFTA Film Award for Best Animated Film. Cruella De Vil was number 39 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 66 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!"]
