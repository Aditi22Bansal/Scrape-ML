["For a while, one needs a scorecard to keep track of all the players. As Redford and Neuman light up the screen, we have an incredible intertwining of characters and motivations playing off each other, leading to the final con. What works is that we have a simple motivation that sets it all up. That is the murder of a friend. All else is directed at that central issue. Soon, the masters of the Sting begin to set up the dominoes, They match bad guys against bad guys, create artificial settings, maneuver things in an orchestrated way. Not everything works perfectly. There are some unexpected pitfalls, including a near-fatal mistake, but the beauty is that these villains are almost excited to be separated from their money. One of the really bright spots of the 1970's."]
