["This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film.However despite it's long running time The Half Blood Prince element feels rushed and the Harry and Ginny relationship forced. Even the wonderful ending of the original book is underplayed.Yates manages to bring a lightness of touch to quite a dark installment but stays true to what will come in the future films. I didn't initially like this film but now, seeing it as part of the overall saga am convinced it is one of the strongest."]
