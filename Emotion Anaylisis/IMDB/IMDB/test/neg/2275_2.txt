["I'll even take the Bates Motel in Psycho after seeing this truly awful film. How did the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody and F. Murray Abraham ever get suckered into making such a colossal mess as this film?You would think that this film could have done without the constant narration and would have been on the scale of a Grand Hotel like atmosphere. Instead it concentrates on the relationship of a concierge and bell boy, with the former jailed for allegedly poisoning a frequent elderly guest. Most of it concerns itself with the bell boy aiding the concierge's escape from prison and the two constantly alluding the authorities.To me, this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Abraham relates the story as he did when he played Salieri in Amadeus in 1984."]
