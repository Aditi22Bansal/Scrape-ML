["I resisted seeing this when I was in high school. You know. All that singing and dancing (and nobody slaughtered). I also noticed some of the girls were reading those books and I wasn't about to be seen at the theater. Time passed and one night it was on TV (many years ago) and I found the artistry, the storytelling, and every aspect of this to be mesmerizing (I even liked the kids and I usually can't stand kid actors). Of course, it's Julie Andrews grabbing hold of the role and taking it to the house. She is cute and caustic and fun. But the person who shows what a huge talent he is is Dick Van Dyke. It came to my attention that the guy never had any dancing lessons. There are two showstoppers at least where my jaw dropped. The Disney animators were able to put him into scenes (way ahead of the advent of CGI) and allow him the freedom to do the most marvelous things. This is a very long movie for a musical comedy. But it doesn't matter. There is love and sadness and all kinds of emotions portrayed here. Feed the birds!"]
