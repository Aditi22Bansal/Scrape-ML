['\'El Topo\' is still one of the strangest movies ever made but Alejandro Jodorowsky amazingly managed to top himself with \'The Holy Mountain\'. This movie contains some of the most weird and wonderful scenes in the history of movies. It is filled with bizarre images which draw upon many religions and occult philosophies, and seems to be inspired equally by Bunuel and the comic book sci-fi surrealism of William Burroughs.  It\'s a cliche but when I say you have to see it to believe it I\'m not lying! The movie is roughly in three sections. The first documents the trials and tribulations of The Thief, a Christ figure. The second introduces The Alchemist (played by Jodorowsky himself) and his seven disciples who are each represented by a planet. The third sees all these odd people (and a chimpanzee) go on a pilgrimage to "The Holy Mountain". I found the third section to be much less interesting than the other two, and that, combined with the sensory overload of the earlier parts of the film, makes it not as successful as \'El Topo\' for me. But there\'s no denying that this is an extraordinary movie and anyone who appreciates strange and challenging films will find this to be the strangest and most challenging of all. Jodorowsky makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay! I can\'t truthfully say I get 90% of what he\'s getting at but boy, is it a trip trying to figure it out!']
