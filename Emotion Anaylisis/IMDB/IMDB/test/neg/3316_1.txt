["Fun movie actually. The first part however was very irritating. The plot was there and the actors were there. Some better treatment should have been given to the movie.\nAkshay kumar was good but he was also very irritating in some parts of the movie. Did'nt liked the part where movie went loud unnecessary.Its a decent timepass, you will get your share of laughter."]
