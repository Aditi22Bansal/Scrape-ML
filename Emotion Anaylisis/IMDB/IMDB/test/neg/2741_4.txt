["Little kids play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent and cause the death of little Robin Hammond. Six years later, Kelly Lynch, Jude Cunningham, Wendy Richards and Nick McBride are in Alexander Hamilton Senior High School hiding the secret of that day. Mr. Hammond (Leslie Nielsen) principal of the school, his wife and their kids Kim (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Alex still mourn the lost. Some creep is calling the four kids and threatening their prom night. Nick is going with Kim to the prom. Meanwhile the police suspects sex offender Leonard Merch killed Robin and hounded him to a fiery crash. He turned catatonic but has just escaped from the mental hospital.This is a Canadian B-movie horror. It's not completely horrible as some other low budget productions of that genre. However one would be kidding to claim this to be a good movie. It does have Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. That's the good part but everybody else is at least a step down. The police part is a waste of time. Overall, there isn't anything interesting. The other kids aren't compelling. The dialog is really clunky at times. It may be only my problem but I suffered through some bad lighting. There are whole sections of near total darkness. The disco is pretty cheesy. This is a generally inferior product."]
