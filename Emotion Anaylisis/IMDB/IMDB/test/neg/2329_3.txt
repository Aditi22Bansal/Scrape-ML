['Let\'s not say awful but rather dreadful to describe this 2011 film. If everyone lives but to 26, look at all the money that would be saved by not having to pay pensions, social security,Medicare, etc. As ridiculous as that statement is, that\'s how ridiculous this entire mess of a movie becomes.People try desperately to by time. What an existence. Those who buy their way into life, they never age. When you run out of time, as shown on your hand, (you\'d think that everyone in the film had been in a concentration camp by the numbers stamped on their hand)you simply drop dead.Of course, our hero rescues our heroine and takes her away from her boring existence to start robbing banks, the main one owned by her father. No, they\'re not exactly "Bonnie and Clyde," but that\'s just what is needed to give credence to this abominable film.']
