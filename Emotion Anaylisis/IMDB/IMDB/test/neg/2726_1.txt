['Apart from the terrible VIEW TO A KILL, I think this is the very worst Roger Moore James Bond film. Most of the blame was on the insistence in having Jaws reappear in this film. Although there were many Bond fans who loved him and he was tolerable in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, he was an embarrassingly stupid character that demeaned the series. I have read all the Bond books and I understand that in most cases the movies only borrow the titles from the original books, but in this case the entire spirit of Bond is gone and the "thrust" in on gadgets, a stupid villain and sexual innuendos like calling Bond\'s love interest "Dr. Goodhead"--wow, what a surprise he actually got some nooky from THIS lady. In general, the movie is like a Bevis and Butthead interpretation of Bond.']
