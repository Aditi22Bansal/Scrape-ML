['This movie was a treat to the eye, and that was about where the hype ended for me. The CGI effects were through the roof and amazingly nice to look at.The story, the plot, the characters? Well, they were taken straight out of a "how to make a Hollywood action movie" book. There was nothing here that haven\'t been seen in a bunch of other movies. Actually, Avatar seems to be a million dollar remake of the "Battle for Terra" animated movie. Everything in this movie is clich√© and seen countless other times. I am not going to give away spoilers for the movie, but once you sit down and watch it, you will go "hmmm, I have seen this exact storyline and event somewhere else"...Were I to give a rating for the CGI and effects alone, this movie would be a top score, but a movie needs to be more than glamorous effects and fireworks - it needs depth and a solid story. This is where Avatar fell apart.And you just got to love the way Cameron worked in the climate situation propaganda. That was just hilarious! Overall, the movie takes you in for a thrillride of spectacular colors and effects, and provides mediocre entertainment story- and plotwise.I was left with a sense of disappointment from this movie. It could have been so much more than a mediocre thrillride.']
