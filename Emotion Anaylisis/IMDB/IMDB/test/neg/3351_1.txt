['WOW!! I\'ve never seen so many negative reviews for a film which is, after all, simply a spin on a comic book hero that may not be dark enough to suit some and not witty enough to please others--but, please, it\'s not as bad as so many of you are claiming!After all, it\'s not as if the filmmakers took a classic piece of literature and took artistic liberties with it. It\'s just a comic book adventure that they\'ve given their own spin to--with results not as spectacular as the previous outings but not as bad as some would have you think. The special effects are awesome and the settings are visually stunning.George Clooney does a workmanlike job as Batman, perhaps more sullen than necessary, especially when dealing with his sidekick, Robin. The sets are spectacular, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a visually impressive Mr. Freeze (Germanic accent and all), and Clooney\'s scenes with "Alfred" are nicely underplayed. Moves at a brisk pace and, despite some annoying characterizations (including Thurman as "Poison Ivy"), it\'s an acceptable entry in the Batman series with both George Clooney and Chris O\'Connell looking fit in their contoured Batman costumes. Not exactly a work of art but certainly does not deserve the brickbats being tossed at it on this board.']
