["A remake of Wes Craven's 1972 movie. Fairly good, and better than the original.The director builds the scenario and tension well and doesn't overdo the horror clich√©s. Convincing acting by a cast of unknowns.The original was pretty much your standard 1970s B-grade exploitation thriller, complete with low production values and hammy acting. This version, on the other hand, is much slicker and has decent performances."]
