['In the Ian Fleming novels, James Bond was not super-human nor did he run around with tons of ridiculous gadgets. He was more a spy and assassin--not a guy with amazing powers. While I loved DR. NO and FROM Russia WITH LOVE, GOLDFINGER is a sad film for me because it ushered in a trend in Bond films that I disliked--ridiculous gadgetry that got in the way of plot. Sure, it was fun watching Oddjob throwing his metallic hat, but it also was pretty stupid if you think about it. Additionally, having Goldfinger use a laser on Bond was just dumb. Like Dr. Evil\'s son suggests in the Austin Powers film, why not just put a bullet in his head and be done with it?!?! If you take away all the gadgets, the rest of the movie is very good and very exciting. Thanks to a long film with lots of twists and turns, it felt like a real adventure--very escapist and satisfying.By the way, in the book, Pussy Galore was clearly a lesbian and Bond was so hyper-manly that he somehow got her to change her sexual orientation. This aspect was "cleaned up" since audiences in 1964 were not ready to see a lesbian major character. In the film, it\'s only hinted at and Ms. Galore seemed like she was more "hard to get" than anything else. Wow,...what a name for a character!']
