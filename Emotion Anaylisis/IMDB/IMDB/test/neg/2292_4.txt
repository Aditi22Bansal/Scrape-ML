['Recent decades have brought along so many good crime dramas from UK and Scandinavia that it is easy to become pretentious and eager to find errors and unrealised solutions. But if the story has framework, the events are intertwined. the wrongdoer(s) do(es) not become obvious too soon and performances are far above average, then I have no reason to purse my lips. I liked Michael C. Hall here as well (he was neither Dexter Morgan nor David Fisher), but my biggest admiration goes to Audrey Fleurot whom I had memorized in some catchy French TV series and films. Well, the teens were again performed by adults and there is a twist in the ending which I began to predict - but it did not create wtf! reactions. True, Safe is e.g. no Luther or Line of Duty, but definitely not a disappointment to be rated with a couple of points only.']
