["Date Movie is a horrible movie with a story that doesn't really go anywhere,although I will admit it makes a better effort than movies like Epic Movie and Disaster Movie,it's only that and that I like Alyson Hannigan are the only reasons I'm didn't give this one out of ten.Other than that,this movie is awful,one of my least favourite things about it is Jennifer Coolidge,an actress that really annoys me that plays an even more annoying version of Barbra Streisands character in Meet The Focker.Julia Jones (Alyson Hannigan) loses a tone of weight to look good for a man she plans to marry,but has to meet his weird parents and ex-wife,who still wants him."]
