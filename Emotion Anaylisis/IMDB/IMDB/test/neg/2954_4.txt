["Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is a pompous brilliant linguist who boasts that he could turn cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady in 6 months. She's hounded by her drunken father (Stanley Holloway) for money. She wants to have lessons from Higgins and Colonel Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White) makes a bet with him.This is a fun musical. As with some musicals of that era, Hepburn's singing is dubbed. No one would dare do that today, but one must not dismiss this movie for doing it back in the day. Hepburn plays the role older. It would help to play up her age. Her older age only helps to create chemistry between her and Harrison. Hepburn is as always very adorable. She is a brilliant comic actress. She and Rex Harrison are great foils for each other. This is a good funny acting duo."]
