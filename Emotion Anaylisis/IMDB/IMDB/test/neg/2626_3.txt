["Tale of children sent away to avoid the bombings of World War 11 England only to find utter mayhem in an enchanted land.Coincidentally, the children are supposed to be the ultimate liberators from The White Queen. The latter, played by Tilda Swinton, is as eerie as my high school chemistry teacher. She holds a sword like a true clod.Jim Broadbent, a fine actor, is utterly wasted here as the man whose house they have gone to only to find a rear closet whose back door reveals this land in turmoil.It's almost like a David and Goliath tale with modern Hollywood technical achievements."]
