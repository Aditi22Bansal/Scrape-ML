['Hollywood ignored the fact that the cult classic musical was virtually unfilmable (not to mention the fact that by 1979 it was already outdated) and made it into a movie anyway. The results are predictably mixed. It\'s not a disaster, but it\'s no classic. It suffers from having a strong narrative forced on it, whereas the stage version felt organic and like it was being made up as the actors went along. The music sounds pretty good, but the whole movie has the taint of the unnecessary.Treat Williams is pretty good, and Nell Carter shows up in a cameo and knocks one out of the park with the "White Boys/Black Boys" number. Milos Forman (of all people) directed.Grade: B-']
