["Groundbreaking, Irreverent, and Absolutely Audacious Black Comedy that was so Original and Over the Top that it could not be Anything but Controversial and Attract a Huge Audience that was Longing for this Type of Anti-Establishment Hollywood Movie. It was Certainly a Product of its time and was Unconventional in an Era when Unconventionality was Celebrated, at Least by People Under Thirty. it is a Movie that was Breaking Bad with No Apologies. It seems Today, rather Tame, but at the Time it Showed Itself to be Cutting Edge in so Many Ways.Lots of on Screen Blood, Jokes about Homosexuality, Impotence and Pubic Hair. Hard Pokes at Authority, Especially the Military, Marital Infidelity, and Racism. It was the First Movie to use the F-Word. The Playful Cast Improvised Director Robert Altman's Vision of Hard Working Life Saving Surgeons in an Impossible Situation with Breezy, Overlapping, Improvisational Dialog, Punctuated with Sarcasm and Wit.Seminal Film, to say the Least, it may seem Somewhat Dated Today and has the Eleven Season TV-Show Haunting its Reputation, but Except for the Ill-Advised, Unfunny, Boring, Slapstick of a Football Game that is the Third Act, the First Two-Thirds can be Considered Influential, Gonzo-Filmmaking at its Best."]
