['This film tells the story of Deadpool who has to find his heart should be at, in order to get through to the woman he loves.The film does make me giggle quite a few times, especially the parachute scene which has one joke after another. It is a film that cannot be taken seriously, even though the ending tries to make it look like a film with some substance. It is more for a brainless laugh, than for an adrenaline fuelled adventure.']
