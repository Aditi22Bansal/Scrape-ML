["Director and screenwriter Christopher Nolan keeps the Batman franchise alive with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. Eight years after Batman(Christian Bale) has left guarding Gotham and actually being labeled fugitive, it is time to resurrect himself. Gotham City is actually crumbling under rampant crime and a lacking anti-crime act. Was it for the greater good Batman being inactive? A ruthless terrorist leader named Bane(Tom Hardy)has put together a dastardly plan to rip a decaying Gotham apart, as well as destroy Batman's legacy. Mild mannered and aging Bruce Wayne must summon what is left of his spirit and rebuild his physical skills to not only defend himself, but once again come to Gotham City's rescue. Special effects are awesomely brutal and the action high octane; just maybe the most entertaining of the franchise. A commanding cast that also features: Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and a miss-cast Anne Hathaway."]
