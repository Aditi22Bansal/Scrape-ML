['After a promising beginning ,the movie has nothing to offer after the "mutation".And even that is a "SSSSS" rip off (1973),this tale of a doctor who transformed man into snake ;but the Bernard Kowalski movie featured an impressive final scene ,when the monster\'s tears begin to fall;on the contrary ,"tusk" drags on and on and on and does not pull any punches .The best scenes belong to Johnny Depp,particularly this sequence in the eating-house where the detective called Lapointe stuffs himself with Junk food ,while sparing the horrified Ally no horrible detail ;this is a good moment of black humor.']
