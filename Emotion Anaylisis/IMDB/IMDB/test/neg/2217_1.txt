['Based on a Stephen King novel, this TV movie adaptation is about the passengers on a red-eye airplane flight from L.A to Boston who awaken to find that the rest of the passengers and crew are gone, and they are all alone on the plane, which will soon run out of fuel. Fortunately, there is a pilot on board, who tries to land the plane at a nearby airport, only to discover that it is also empty, and that they are being pursued by giant, howling monsters called Langoliers that seem to be devouring time itself...Potentially interesting take on time travel, with an appealing cast of characters(except Bronson Pinchot, quite good playing an obnoxious and terrified child-like man who knows all about the Langoliers from his hideous father.) cannot save far-fetched premise, and the primitive CGI Langoliers have not aged well... Still, not the worst way to kill three hours!']
