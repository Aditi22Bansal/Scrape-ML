['In the first place, I consider it a blasphemy to remake a Wes Craven movie, even one as disgusting as "The Hills Have Eyes". In the second place, the idea of nuclear tests turning people into bloodthirsty mutants - had they used it in the \'70s - could have been one of the many movies involving fear of the government (along with "The Parallax View", "Three Days of the Condor", "All the President\'s Men" and "Capricorn One").So, they not only remade a Wes Craven movie, but they used it as an excuse to show gratuitous violence. I usually really like slasher movies, but I found nothing entertaining about this one. It was just plain gross. Kathleen Quinlan and Ted Levine should have known better than this. Avoid it.As for anything about nuclear tests and their effects, just watch "The Atomic Cafe".']
