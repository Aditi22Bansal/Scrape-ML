["Five teens go to an isolated cabin in the woods for a weekend. In the basement of the cabin they find an assortment of relics, books and ancient artefacts. In reading from a book they then inadvertently summon a family of zombie killers. However, they've only just scratched the surface of what the cabin is hiding.Pleasantly surprised, but ultimately disappointing. Was expecting your average (i.e. crap) horror movie but for the first 60% or so of the movie it was very interesting. Intriguing, engaging and, most surprising, funny.From a point, however, it degenerates into your usual humans-vs- ghouls/zombies schlock, and from then on it is incredibly formulaic and tiresome."]
