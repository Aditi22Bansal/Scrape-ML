['I preferred this version slightly over the \'73 version although it too was great. Reasons why I preferred this was in the acting (newer slightly w/Malek & Hunnam over the prestigious McQueen & Hoffman); the locations (newest: Serbia, Malta, Montenegro over the older Hawaii, Jamaica, Spain) & definitely sets, props, costumes in the newer.\nSupposedly, Papillon the tale is at best 75% true with a large part being an aggregate of other inmates experiences. According to French records he was not imprisoned on Devil\'s Island which incidentally has nice slopping beaches; not cliffs. What was surprising to me was that this small boat made it via wind/currents from French Guiana along hundreds of miles of Atlantic ocean to the northern tip of S.A. & Colombia, and not ending up in mid-Atlantic. Supposedly Charri√®re "Papillon" (butterfly in french of which he carried a tattoo) tried several times to escape in his 11+ years of incarceration (imprisoned in 1933 released in 1945); spent most of his subsequent life in Venezuela; book published in 1969; died in 1973.']
