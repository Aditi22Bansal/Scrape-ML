["Poor direction, like a soap opera, awful dialogue, don't let a toff write about real world as it's not like that, trying to do satire, possibly in the House of Lords.Even the continuity is all over the shop and the music, why? Incorrect police and army procedure. Typical BBC sickly PC rubbish, every race and sexual preference crammed straight in, all boohoo stories making out how poor refugees are treated, how women are victims of the male oppressor, the Israeli's are all war criminals, the church hates gays but they are all gay themselves, not forgetting that all the services are racist etc. In fact if they had travelled through the countries they would be economic migrants but god forbid the BBC saying anything truthful. When it comes to the story, well it jumps to suit itself, implausible is nothing and you will laugh at the drug delivery system, seriously.\nAs for the acting, well even Mulligan and Simm look rigid and uncomfortable, the rest have probably been on some afternoon rubbish like Doctors. The quicker the BBC understand that the real world exists outside of London they might make the 21st century, remove the licence and let them work in the real world."]
