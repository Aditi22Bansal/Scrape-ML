['I got to admit, during the start of this movie. It seemed like it would be a at least an entertaining ride with bizarre elements. In another words, by the starting few minutes I thought this movie would be a treat. However after the first few minutes, the movie really started to plummet. The movie is like "The Human Centipede" except without the shock factor, nor is it suspenseful or scary. I am not sure if the movie is trying to be funny with some goofy scenes, but it isn\'t funny either. The movie isn\'t super awful, but it just seemed like the movie was done as a joke. Or it\'s just a movie made with the thought of putting Smith and Depp\'s daughters in it. The protagonist is a bit of a jerk, but I have seen worse, however is not in par with Kevin Smith when it comes to the level of being an asshole.4.6/10']
