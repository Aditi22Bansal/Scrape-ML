["This is by far one of Adam Sandler's worst movies. I usually like him, but not in this. Sandler plays both Jack and Jill. Jill comes to visit for Thanksgiving and hangs out through the New Year. She is annoying, has a pet bird, and sweats a lot. Jack needs Al Pacino to star in a donut add and for some add reason, Al gets the hots for Jill. But, this is good for Jack, so he can get close to Al.The whole thing was just silly, I mean Al Pacino wanting to date Jill. And Jill is just so manly and has such a whiny voice. It was just silly and not funny. Katie Holmes has a lackluster role in this, why was she even there? FINAL VERDICT: Don't waste your time with this."]
