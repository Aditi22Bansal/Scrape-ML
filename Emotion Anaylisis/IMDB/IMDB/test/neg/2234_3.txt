["I really enjoyed the first attempt of Rob with his view on Michael Myers, but here things go terribly wrong. As with so many sequels the killer is more in the headlight with stupid things. Remember Freddy Kreuger suddenly peeling an apple with his glove. Here we have some weird things going on, he's seeing his mom dressed in white with a white horse. Michael going to the supernatural. Even his sister has the same problems, she's seeing the same demons. All of that takes the movie away from being a slasher to another dimension. Even the fact that we see Michael without his mask is for me not done. It takes away the mystery of the killer. It's like Pinhead (hellraiser) standing in full light. Even the part of Loomis is sometimes too long and takes you further away from Michael. Not as good as his first attempt."]
