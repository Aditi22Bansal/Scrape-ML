['The film picks up where the other one leaves off. The dead Michael Myers is carted off on the meat wagon. Oh, Wait! "I\'m not dead yet. I don\'t want to get on the cart!" He wonders around the countryside for two years and then on Halloween he is back doing van conversions. The characters fell off a cliff. The writing for the second part was very substandard. I was disappointed with the sequel which included the addition or Weird Al, Margot Kidder, and Octavia Spencer who went to better things.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Sylvia Jefferies +uncredited)']
