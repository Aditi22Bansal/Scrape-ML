['Retired jewel thief living in a lavish villa on the French Riviera is accused of being notorious bauble-burglar "The Cat", currently scaling the rooftops of the swankiest hotels in France; he sets out to discover who\'s copying his moves. Alfred Hitchcock and company on vacation; the film is a swirling, costumed, powder-puffed piece of eye-candy, and none of it leaves the slightest impression whatsoever. Cary Grant (looking overly-tanned) glides through the picture with a bemused smirk, while Grace Kelly fills her gowns (and Grant\'s arms) beautifully. Grace, playing the pampered, school-perfected daughter of a wealthy American, purrs seductively into Cary\'s ear during a fireworks show, asking him to finger the jewels around her neck; moments later, when her own mother\'s jewels have gone missing, she turns into an enraged, accusatory woman-scorned. Why? Because screenwriter John Michael Hayes (working from David Dodge\'s novel) can\'t come up with anything plausible or substantial to move this story along. Therefore, few of these characters acts in a sensible way, leaving us little to do but sit back and admire their wardrobes and surroundings. It passes the time. **1/2 from ****']
