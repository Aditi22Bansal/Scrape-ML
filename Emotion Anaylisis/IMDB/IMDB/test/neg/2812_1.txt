['Here\'s another "cult favorite" that I was really, really anxious to view after reading a bunch of favorable comments about in review books. What a disappointment! Of the positive things I had read, "eerily filmed" and "fascinating" appealed to me most. I found neither. Did I expect too much?How a film this slow moving could be a cult favorite with today\'s audiences is beyond me. I don\'t believe it\'s true. I did appreciate some of the photography but the story dragged in so many spots that it took any enjoyment away from any good visuals. One of the reasons the secular-dominated critics might have liked this was that the main character went to work as a church organist, but was not a Believer. I\'m sure that part resonated with them. Otherwise, what\'s to like in this film? I\'m sorry, but this is way overrated.']
