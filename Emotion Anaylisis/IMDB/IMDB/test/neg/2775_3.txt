["Much-celebrated, well-acted drama has Bette Davis in now-famous role as Margo Channing, Broadway actress with a heart-of-gold who takes in devoted fan Anne Baxter, unaware the neophyte has designs on her life. Boozy and bitchy, and written with a cleverly poisonous pen, but not especially interesting once all the pieces have fallen into place (with at least thirty minutes left on the clock). These pompous, dryly decadent people do a lot of emoting and sounding-off, but we don't learn much about what's going on under the surface. Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz doesn't so much see this story as a chess-board as he does a gossipy cocktail party. Despite the film's multiple Oscars, it can leave one with a chilly, hollowed-out impression. **1/2 from ****"]
