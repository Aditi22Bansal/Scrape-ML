["This is one of the craziest stories I have ever heard of, like this went from animal abuse to ridicilous personal drama in which animals were irrelevant. All the characters are unlikeable, the story is so stretched (like episode 3 should've been 15 minutes long) and some facts weren't brought to light (this series barely touches animal abuse subject). Joe Exotic might be entertaining but he ain't better than any of other characters in this documentary but I guess he would a better president than Trump."]
