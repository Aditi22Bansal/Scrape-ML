['So sad to squander an opportunity like this to make an important film about black history. I kind of knew from the outset that this was likely a hot mess -- two directors, 4 writers, no mention of a costume designer, an actress playing the daughter of another actress who is only 7 years younger and it looks like it too -- these are signs of trouble... and nobody looks happy about being in the film, including Octavia. This film is plain awful. I watched half of the first episode before I began skipping through the rest to watch scenes, but it never got better.']
