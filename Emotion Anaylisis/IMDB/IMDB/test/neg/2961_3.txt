['What made the spaghetti westerns different from John Wayne movies and such was that they showed the Old West as violent and gritty, and the people as dirty (the John Wayne movies portrayed the Old West as fancy and the people as good, clean Christians). "Per un pugno di dollari" (called "A Fistful of Dollars" in English) definitely showed the dismal side. The plot of course has The Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) arriving in a small town and playing two groups off against each other.Obviously, Sergio Leone\'s spaghetti westerns are the ones against which all others should be judged. This one not only had two sequels, but also paved the way for Leone directing "Once Upon a Time in the West" and "Once Upon a Time in America". It\'s not exactly a great movie, but definitely a groundbreaking one. As it was, 1964 saw a number of groundbreaking things: the Beatles coming to America, "Dr. Strangelove", and the Civil Rights Act.And yes, when my parents were in Spain in 1992, they drove through the town where this was filmed. They could clearly see that it looked like the town in the movies.']
