['The gruesome granddaddy of all films living dead, the original "Night of the Living Dead" still devours its successors. With this one, George A. Romero produced the horror equivalent of "Citizen Kane". His black and white photography, and direction, is outstanding. And, Mr. Romero\'s excesses are in check; every indulgence seen on screen gratifyingly fits the mood of the film. Karl Hardman, John Russo, and Russ Streiner are certainly most valuable players. The "non-acting" approach of heroic Duane Jones (as Ben) and the cast is effective, and refreshing. Influential and inspirational, the film\'s "anti-Hollywood" and/or "low budget" flaws have been rendered irrelevant. A startling masterpiece of light, shadow, and sheer will.********** Night of the Living Dead (10/1/68) George A. Romero ~ Duane Jones, Judith O\'Dea, Karl Hardman, Russell Streiner']
