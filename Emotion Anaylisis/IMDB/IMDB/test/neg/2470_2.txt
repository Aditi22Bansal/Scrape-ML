['Yes, Attention Spans seem to be getting Shorter, but what about Memory Loss or the Inability to be Aware of what has been done and Better. So many Critics and Fans of this Movie have called it Original. Really.Are They Completely Ignorant of the Sci-Fi Genre, The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits or Countless Movies that have Explored this Subject. This is about as Unoriginal as it gets. It is Recycling to be Kind or a Rip-Off and Parasitic at Worst.The Film has a Good, Clean, Semi-Attractive Look but the Story, Acting, and Droll Style becomes Tedious as the Movie Drones On. There are Patches of Interesting Things but as a Complete Piece of Work it is just too Familiar.The Predictable Ending, the Inordinate Amounts of Tilted Heads and Close Ups, and the Uncomfortable Sex Scenes Destroy any Appeal that the Film is Building Upon. Joaquin Phoenix, Thankfully, Sports a Mustache to Cover His Scar and that\'s a Good Thing because it can be a Distraction at times, but here there are So Many Extreme Face Shots that it would have been Horrifying.Highly Overrated Movie that is Not Deep, Not Romantic, and Not Technologically Interesting. The Film tries to be All these Things and Barely Manages a Blip of Intrigue Concerning its Conceits. Worth a Watch but Stop with the "This is so original." Accolades. it is Anything but.']
