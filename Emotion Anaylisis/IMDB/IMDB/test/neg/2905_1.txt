["Breathless (1960).. also À bout de Souffle. Some very interesting filming techniques used (and avoided) during this production, according to the trivia section. Apparently based on an actual event that Truffaut had read about in the states. When a thief (Poiccard, played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) tries to make a getaway, it turns to tragedy, and suddenly his future looks even darker. Thank goodness he has Patricia (Jean Seberg) by his side! The story is solid. Unfortunately, white captions on white backgrounds, so sometimes we miss what they are saying, unless your français is really good. Directed by JeanLuc Godard. Rated high on imdb, 7.8 as of today. And when they show it on Turner Classics, they sometimes include an interview, led by the (awesome but now deceased) host Robert Osborne. This was part of the 2021 film festival, virtual this year, due to ongoing pandemic issues. Sadly, miss Seberg died at 40 of an overdose. Belmondo was nominated for two Bafta's during the 1960s."]
