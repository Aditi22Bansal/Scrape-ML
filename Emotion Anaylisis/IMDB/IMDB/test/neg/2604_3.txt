['Set in 1994, Jennifer Aniston is Sarah Huttinger, about 30 and living in NYC. She is traveling home to L.A. for her sister\'s wedding, and bringing her fianc√©e Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) with her. This will be Jeff\'s first chance to meet her relatives. One of those relatives is her deceased mother\'s mother (\'don\'t call me grandmother\') Katherine, played capably by the always good Shirley MacLaine.The premise for the movie\'s story is that when back home, Sarah hears some gossip which leads her to believe that her real father is an old friend of her mother\'s, Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner). Seems that her mother, grandmother, and Beau were the real people that "The Graduate" was based on. That perhaps, when Sarah\'s mother disappeared for a few days before her wedding, she became pregnant with Sarah.No, it isn\'t a great movie, but it is enjoyably entertaining.SPOILERS. Beau admits to having slept with grandma and momma back in 1963, but some years earlier he had been injured in a soccer game, kicked in the jewels which rendered him sterile. Turns out, it was Sarah\'s father who had done the kicking! Sarah\'s father was her real father after all, but now Sarah had alienated Jeff by unwisely sleeping with Beau herself, in a moment of great weakness. In the end, Sarah asked for forgiveness, and it looked like she and Jeff would get married after all.']
