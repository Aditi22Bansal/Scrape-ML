["First of all, it wouldn't make any sense watching this movie if you don't know the movies it is spoofing. But then again, it doesn't make sense (to me) to watch this movie after all even if you know the movies that are being spoofed. What I mean is, I knew/recognised the movie-references and couldn't laugh, a friend of mine didn't recognise any, but didn't laugh either ...Now the question is, how can you spoiler this movie without spoiler(ing?), all the movies that it has stolen .. ah I mean paid tribute to? I think it's not possible, but then again, a movie that makes fun of Ms. Lopez famous body part in a never-ending sequence, might be not the movie you want to spoiler! (if this sentence didn't make sense to you watch the movie, and you'll understand ... nothing!) ;o) Anyways, I know that there a few people out there that liked the movie (someone even told me the other day, so I know for sure), but if you can't completely shut down your brain, this movie will definitely not work for you!"]
