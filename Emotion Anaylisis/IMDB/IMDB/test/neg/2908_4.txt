['In my opinion, "Don\'t Look Now" constitutes a real collision of different kinds of careers. Nicolas Roeg had already directed the surreal "Walkabout", Donald Sutherland had starred in the humorous "M*A*S*H", and Julie Christie had won an Oscar for the bleak "Darling". So this one must have really blown people\'s minds when it came out. Portraying a couple losing a child to a drowning, and thereafter experiencing some rather unexplainable occurrences, the movie might make you question your own sanity. I will say that it\'s not outright scary, but those scenes on the river...well, just see if you can keep breathing normally after watching those.Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I did not see that ending coming (although I doubt that anyone could predict it). So do look now, and watch the movie...if you dare. Because he\'s right: nothing is what it seems.']
