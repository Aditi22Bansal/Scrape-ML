['I\'m probably not the best judge of films like this because I just don\'t care about zombie flicks. There\'s something iconic about the original "Night of the Living Dead" that couldn\'t be duplicated in this sequel; part of it could be the use of iconic black and white in filming NOTLD, part of it could simply be the attempt at exploiting a formula that worked in the past. There was hardly even a story here, as it was all about four people trapped in a shopping mall knocking off the undead, and doing a poor job of it in many cases. I couldn\'t count the number of times I would have used a handgun or a rifle to dispatch a zombie only a few feet away that the principal characters allowed to walk on by. And not too quickly either I might add. Gosh but these zombies were slow. In the future, I think I\'ll take my zombie cinema in the way of pictures like "Shaun of the Dead", that is, with a great big heaping of satirical fun. Not to mention deadpan humor, although I just did.']
