['Luke has had a bad drunk night, and ends it by cutting the heads off of parking meters. This doesn\'t go well with the police, and he is given two years on a chain gang.While Paul Newman\'s career was long and memorable, I think that "Cool Hand Luke" possibly ranks as his most memorable. Newman is something of an anti-hero, where we love him despite his faults and hope to see him escape from his captors, though we know full well that he is guilty of the crime for which he is interred.The most memorable scene? Of course, the egg-eating scene with fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Amazing (though far from any sort of record). I have read that this scene is supposed to have some sort of Christian symbolism. I\'m not entirely convinced, and won\'t be until I hear it from the creators, but it\'s an interesting theory.']
