['Very Thin Urban Crime Thriller that is Weak, because it simply attempts to be more than it is. Even the overall Template of the "Town" given much Script Time falls Short of Endearing its Charm and it all seems to have a Patina of Plastic Overlay. The Buddy bits are Not Convincing or realized and the coupling of the Criminal and the Victim as Lovers seems Forced, Facile, and Artificial. It is a Movie that draws attention to what it is not rather than what it is. An Unsuccessful effort at a Multi-Layered, Sentimental yet Hard Boiled Gangster Tale of Family, Friends, and the Futility of an Environmental Entrapment.Some Stylish and Exciting Action Sequences Saves the Film from Wispy Indifference.']
