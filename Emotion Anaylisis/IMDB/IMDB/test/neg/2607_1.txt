['In future Chicago, the inhabitants have fenced off the city and split society into five factions. Abnegation is selfless and put in charge of the government. Amity is the cheerfully peaceful farm workers. Candor is honest. Dauntless is the wild brave protector. Erudite is the intelligent scientists. Those who don\'t belong are forced to live as Factionless. Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives as an Abnegation with her family. She is about to choose her lifelong Fraction in the Choosing Ceremony. Tori (Maggie Q) gives her a test and tells her that she\'s Divergent meaning she has more than one element in her. It\'s something that must be hidden. She switches Fraction to Dauntless and trained by Four (Theo James). There is a dark scheme underway by Erudite leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet).The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is "I don\'t buy this world." Every revelation led me to question the origins of this world. This future world seems weakly drawn. I also don\'t buy the motivations of Dauntless leadership. I like some of the characters and willing to buy their stories. It\'s not the best of the young adult friction but it works enough to continue.']
