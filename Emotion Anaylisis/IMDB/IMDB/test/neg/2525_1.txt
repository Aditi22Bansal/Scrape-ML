["From the hilarious minds of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Coming of age. Normal...somewhat maybe. Awakening and most definitely remembering for three socially inept teenage boys. Seth(Jonah Hill), Evan(Michael Cera)and Fogell(Christopher Mintz-Piasse)have an outrageous night like no other. There friendship is pretty much full blown dependency and Seth and Evan are upset about going to different colleges. Plus there is the content...virgin thing to worry about. They rely on Fogell to help in scoring some alcohol to take to a wild party. This mission seems to be a failure from the get-go. A panic-driven night will supply enough humiliation to last a life time. Your mind will have you doing the outrageous...just trying to get 'some'.Funny, vulgar and a riot. Time to go in demented mode and enjoy. Also in the cast: Bill Harder, Martha Macisaac, Emma Stone and Seth Rogen."]
