["Kind of like The Dome. Pointless. I'm used to disappointment when it comes to SF in the movies and more so on TV. But this show managed to roll up into one big package everything shallow and pointless. Halfway thru the first episode it hit me: I don't care. Don't care what happens to the characters, don't care what happens to the ship, don't care what happens to the plot. Its just plain dull -- which is a common byproduct of a committee-meeting type of story creation. Instead of a good solid idea we get stuck with 15 mediocre ideas and then the writing staff stands up and pats themselves on the back because they 'agreed' on the storyline *and sold it to some studio*. Which was probably the point. What happened to all the good storytellers? Or any of them for that matter. The best thing about watching the first episode is I can safely skip all the following ones and save myself a lot of time."]
