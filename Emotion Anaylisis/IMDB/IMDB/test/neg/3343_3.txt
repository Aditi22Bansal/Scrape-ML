["CATWOMAN (2004) ** Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt, Sharon Stone, Lambert Wilson, Alex Borstein, Frances Conroy. Berry (barely) acquits herself as the notorious femme fatale comic book character in the latest big-screen adaptation of a cult character that relies on style over substance no thanks to some campy borderline dull moments conceived by first time helmsman Pitof (!) Not as bad as you'd think but not necessarily a new franchise with some questionable costume design (namely Berry's so tacky Frederick's of Hollywood discount dominatrix get-up that would have many Halloween parties a titter at) and a purloined screenplay (same plotline from the first 'BATMAN' where the Joker had digs on a poisonous cosmetics line; same deal here except with Eurotrash Lambert hamming it up and the deliciously over-the-top Stone as his nasty wife) that begs to question: couldn't they get Michelle Pfeiffer to reprise her role? A few fun moments that tiptoe into entertaining with its sleek production design and jazzy editing to shake the few plot holes up."]
