['Yesterday was Farrah Fawcett\'s 60th birthday (and it\'s good hear that she\'s cancer-free after a bout with it), so I wanted to review one of her movies, although she isn\'t the lead role in "Logan\'s Run". This is one of those \'70s sci-fi movies that had a tinge of the counterculture in it, what with how Logan (Michael York) seeks to run away from this seemingly "ideal" society. I mean, let\'s face it: wasn\'t part of the social movement in the \'60s a rejection of middle-class mores?True, the movie does have a slightly hokey \'70s feel to itself - the sets, the music - but I find it hard not to like. And the idea of people getting discarded at thirty certainly reflects our young-celebrity-obsessed culture. Worth seeing. Also starring Richard Jordan, Jenny Agutter (looking as hot as ever) and Peter Ustinov.']
