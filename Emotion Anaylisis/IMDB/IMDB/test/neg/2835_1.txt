['Apart from the cheesy ape prosthetics, this was a nearly perfect sci-fi movie that had absolutely no reason to remake it other than to make a fast buck! Nothing about the remake can beat many of the wonderful lines or scenes from the movie. Taylor yelling "Get your hands off me, do damned, dirty apes!" and "This is a MADHOUSE---a MADHOUSE!!" are classic lines and I also love the scene during Taylor\'s trial when the orangutans are sitting in the SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL poses! These are some of the greatest moments in film history and yet some moron wants a remake?!? The movie, despite having several writers come and go (including Rod Serling), is well scripted, directed and who could have done a better job than Charleton Heston or Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter? The film is creative, energetic and concludes with one of the most visually impressive scenes in sci-fi history. All these combine for a great film. PERIOD!']
