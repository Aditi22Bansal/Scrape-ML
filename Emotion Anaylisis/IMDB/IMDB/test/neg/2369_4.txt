["Sam Raimi's Spider Man trilogy began in 2002 and a decade later we have the reboot with Andrew Garfield's more geeky hipster take replacing Tobey Maguire.However the film feels pointless, we have another origins story with Peter Parker getting bit by a radioactive spider and learns to harness his new powers and then the tragedy of Uncle Ben dying and realising that with his powers comes responsibility.The villain here is a Green Lizard instead of the Green goblin, a man wanting to regrow his arm but the experiment goes horribly wrong. The police pursue Spider Man as they believe he is a menace and Parker has a touching and believable relationship with Gwen Stacy whose father is the policeman pursuing Spidey.The film is well made, slightly darker hued after the rebooted Dark Knight films, a good mix of action special effects and humour although the CGI lizard could had been better but the film feels empty despite the efforts of Andrew Garfield. A soulless film made solely so Columbia Pictures can retain the rights to make Spider Man films."]
