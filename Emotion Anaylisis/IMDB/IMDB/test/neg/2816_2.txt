["a crazy story. and a great cast. absurd events. and dark humor. and the complicity of viewer to crime. because two lovely aunts and the noble purpose who gives force to their gestures are axis of a chaotic, lovely story about love, family, web of secrets and a young man looking save situation. like many classic films, the flavor is the basic instrument to seduce. but not only. because it is a strange film noir and a wise expression of comedy. because the atmosphere of play remains but in the clothes of Frank Capra's comedy. nothing new. but original in a delicate manner because it mix the stories in inspired manner. so, one of films about old well known things in a nice manner. and the admirable couple Jean Adair - Josephine Hull.Cary Grant in middle of strong tempest. and the final as a form of sunrise. so, old flavors. memorable ones."]
