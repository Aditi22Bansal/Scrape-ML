['When the viewer watches any 007 franchise, he or she knows what is going to see: an entertaining full of action adventure, with beautiful women, car chase, conspiracy, great villains, predictable story and a brainless screenplay. "Spectre" is no exception and provides an additional amusing situation, with the weirdo Daniel Craig seducing the gorgeous LÃ©a Seydoux and Monica Bellucci without any chemistry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "007 Contra Spectre" ("007 against Spectre")']
