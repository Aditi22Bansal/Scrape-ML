['Blistering, dead-on indictment of today\'s television business, a \'satire\' only in retrospect (as screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky might attest to). I\'m amused at the comments from students who viewed this film in class, writing, "It was a good movie for its time." A good movie is great for any time, and "Network" is a great movie. Posthumous Best Actor Oscar winner Peter Finch gives a harrowing performance as a TV news-anchor whose slipping sanity is used and abused by the network big-wigs; Best Actress winner Faye Dunaway is the sharp, soulless producer drowning deliriously in her work (she wants a separate life away from her job, but doesn\'t want to make compromises or pay any prices); Beatrice Straight won the Supporting Actress Oscar for small but solid role as William Holden\'s neglected wife; however, it is William Holden\'s work as an executive from the news division who holds the picture together, bringing it a current of sanity and logic. Holden struggles, he tries to do the right thing, he grits his teeth and covers his eyes at what he sees. Holden is positively amazing. It may be the finest performance of his long, esteemed career. "Network" is a wild and bumpy ride with mostly despicable people, and I laughed throughout the madness. ***1/2 from ****']
