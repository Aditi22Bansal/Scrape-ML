["When I heard that they were making an adaptation for Cruise's 2002 Science fiction, I was hyped, Then I heard that Fox was producing, And suddenly I had mixed feelings, Although Fox is known for making great science fiction, They do tend to cut the show before it gets to take off. E.g. Firefly, Almost Human etc.Law Enforcement getting help from civilians or even criminals seems to be quite the trend in TV shows these day e.g. Limitless,Blindspot,The Mentalist, The Blacklist etc. As the pattern continues with this series, As one of the three PreCogs is hidden amongst civilians trying to prevent crimes from occurring, however without his siblings, There is only so much he can do, As he is only one piece of the puzzle and it doesn't seem to be enough. Although this is produced by some serious names including Spielberg, It is a fairly weak adaptation, Especially when compared to the movie.Grade: F"]
