["Note: I have watched season 1, and I don't plan on watching further if they make moreThis show has a few good moments finally combining these heroes (you need to watch the previous seasons, Daredevil 1 & 2 at a minimum), but it never really wows the viewer. It is consoling that the season was not dragged out to a full 10-13 episode season; the 6 episodes were plenty to get the point across."]
