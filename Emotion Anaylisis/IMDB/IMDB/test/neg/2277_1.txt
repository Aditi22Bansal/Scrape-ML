["As much as I dread being exposed to this kind of subject matter, I decided to put myself through this purely to learn more about this incredibly high profile case. Unfortunately, the documentary doesn't really go into enough detail about Epstein himself. Prior to watching it I had no idea how Epstein became rich and what his and public and private lives were like. Having watched it, I still don't really know too much and felt short-changed in regards to the other famous people who may be involved in this disgusting underworld.The interviews with the victims were incredibly sad to watch. Yes these scenes were drawn out and repetitive but I fully appreciate these women being given a platform to share their experiences. I also felt the show did a good job of keeping things as objective as possible and not playing judge and jury, as tempting as that must be. I sincerely hope there will be some kind of follow-up to this story and that the other pieces of human garbage involved in this paedophile pyramid scheme are put through the wringer."]
