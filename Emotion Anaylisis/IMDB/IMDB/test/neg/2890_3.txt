['Almost Mediocre Major Studio Movie that was not impressive in 1971 and fails to be of only moderate interest Today. It\'s Camp Value (meaning Cheesy) is what makes it work for some Folks, but for the most part its Glaring Ineptitudes cannot be forgiven, even for a Cheap Thrill.There are many things that stand out as Pedestrian and are Workmanlike and carry very little imagination. The Musical Score is ill fitting, chinsy, and intrude on many Scenes rather than underly or enhance. The Lepers (yes, there is some Clunky Christ Analogies) are Dressed Up like Monks and speak in some sort of Post Apocalyptic Religioso Jargon. "He of the Wheel" and so forth.Of Heston\'s Sci-Fi Trilogy of the Era, this is the worst by far. Watching Chuck watch Woodstock (1969) alone in a Movie Theatre mouthing the Dialog and uttering "they don\'t make em\' like that anymore" is not Eerie, just Irritating. Movie Audiences are to Lament the fact that they don\'t make any Movies anymore. Now that\'s something to feel sorry about after the World has Virtually been Wiped Out of People.But if they were only making Movies as Unremarkable and Flaccid as this one, that might not be a Bad Thing. That perfectly describes this one. A Bad Thing.']
