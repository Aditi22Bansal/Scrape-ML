['Successful California "Gold Rush" prospector Lee Marvin (as Ben Rumson) is in his element after digging a grave for the brother of singing cowboy Clint Eastwood (as Pardner). A self-described "boozing man," Mr. Marvin likes to live under the influence. Like Mr. Eastwood, Marvin also likes to sing. The two men become companions, sealing their relationship with a simple exchange: Marvin says, "I like you Pardner," and Eastwood says, "I like you Ben." Since they are heterosexual, Marvin buys beautiful Jean Seberg (as Elizabeth) to be their wife. At $800, Ms. Seberg\'s a steal.Simply put, "Paint Your Wagon" is a too long, stupid, and wasteful movie. But, it didn\'t have to beÂ… Since the studio was obviously spending money, why didn\'t somebody suggest paying Frank Sinatra to do Marvin\'s role, and giving Elvis Presley whatever Colonel Parker was asking, to take Eastwood\'s part? Then, think about the fun in casting "Elizabeth". The mind boggles. Anyway, the musical highlights are Marvin\'s "Wandrin\' Star" (late in the film) and Harve Presnell\'s "They Call the Wind Mariah" (early in the running time). Ray Walston is a supporting asset, and Tom Ligon catches on fast.** Paint Your Wagon (10/15/69) Joshua Logan ~ Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, Jean Seberg']
