["TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a classic adaption of a classic novel. I remember reading and watching this at school but most of the civil rights-era background when right over my head. Not really worth exploring a movie dealing with mature themes as a kid, but there you go. Watching it again as an adult, it's a delight and as hard-hitting as MISSISSIPPI BURNING, which came much later.I've always liked Gregory Peck and his laconic Atticus Finch is an exploration of a quiet, inherently decent man. It's a subtle performance of amazing strength, with no showy-off 'acting' scenes or the like; Peck's Oscar win was well deserved and it's a pity that Brock Peters didn't get best supporting actor for his excellent one-scene performance in which he relates his version of events to the courthouse.I particularly liked the way the narrative develops through the eyes of a pair of innocent children as it adds another layer to the story. The whole sub-plot involving Boo Radley is a classic bit of mischief and I love the way the two plots tie up neatly at the end. The child actors are exceptionally strong and despite the lengthy running time the movie doesn't have any slow spots; it's all relevant and adds to the experience. As I said, this is a great movie."]
