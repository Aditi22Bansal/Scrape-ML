['Not withstanding the historical inaccuracies I will stick with entertainment value of this movie. If somebody allowed me to summon this movie in one short sentence "Outdated with clich√©d dialogs" would be it. Ranveer Singh & Arjun Kapoor were never in it, if you know what I am saying. Besides hamming it up and showing off their six packs the actors impact in the movie were minimal. Two of the songs were good and the only saving grace of the movie. I believe Yash Raj Films instinctively knew this & therefore didn\'t over utilize it in their promos. The storyline and treatment were so bland that by the time the story meandered to its end the audience didn\'t give a rat\'s pa tut how it finished, as long as it finished. Poor Poor version of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Feel sorry for the suckers who got conned into watching this movie.']
