["Let me state right off the bat that I like both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I loved them both in Wedding Crashers. That was a very funny movie. This one, not so much, and because it's rated PG-13 and not R, there isn't as much raunch as in WC. Actually, this one is supposed to be even more of a nice vibe between comedy and sweetness than WC and I actually liked that. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I didn't find much that was funny during many of the beginning scenes. It did pick up much near the end and overall, The Internship wasn't too bad. Part of me wouldn't even mind seeing it again if asked. Just don't expect a non-stop laugh-getter is all I'm sayin'..."]
