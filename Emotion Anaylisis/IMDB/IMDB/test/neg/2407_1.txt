['Adventurous animated feature; CGI enhanced and at times constructed with visual brilliance. "Shrek", "Nemo" and even "Cars" fear not; MONSTER HOUSE is just not THAT good; but nonetheless a hoot to watch. The photography is better than a lot out there. Some of the humor may actually go over the heads of the prepubescent throngs with eyes glued to the bright and colorful screen. It helps to have well liked characters. DJ(Mitchel Musso)lives right across the street from an old house owned by Mr. Nebbercracker(Steve Buscemi). DJ and his friend Chowder(Sam Lerner)lose a ball to the crotchety geezer, who has a heart attack before the boys can get their ball back. The house takes on a life of its own, gobbling up the ball...just an appetizer before gulping up innocent animals and foolish trespassers. A new friend in the neighborhood Jenny(Spencer Locke), yes...a girl, joins forces with DJ and Chowder trying to convince anyone who will listen to the unlikely story of the freaky activities of the Monster House. Other voices giving life to this macabre little tale: Catherine O\'Hara, Jason Lee, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kathleen Turner, Kevin James and Fred Willard.']
