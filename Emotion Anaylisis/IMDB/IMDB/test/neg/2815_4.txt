["Mortimer Brewster (Cary Grant) is a drama critic and author of anti-marriage books. He marries neighbor Elaine Harper (Priscilla Lane). His elderly aunts (Josephine Hull, Jean Adair) seem like sweet old ladies at first who take in boarders as an altruistic act. However it turns out they're crazy serial killers. Just when it seems it can't get any worst. Brother Jonathan Brewster (Raymond Massey) returns with a new face and plastic surgeon Dr. Herman Einstein (Peter Lorre). It turns out he is a crazy serial killer as well.It's a wacky broad black comedy. The comedy works best with Cary Grant. Priscilla Lane isn't quite up to his level. The aunts are kind of fun. When the brother comes in, the movie takes a very dark turn. It almost becomes a horror movie. Then Cary Grant comes back, and it becomes a slapstick comedy. This is hilarious at times, but it's very uneven with such a dark character thrown into the middle."]
