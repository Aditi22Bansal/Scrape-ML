['Canada\'s "Camp North Star" is the setting for summer fun. In the opening scene, groggy camp counselor Bill Murray (as Tripper Harrison) doesn\'t seem up for the job. He perks up fast when the new crop of school-aged kids arrive. The main co-star is sensitive Chris Makepeace (as Rudy Gerner), a lonely boy who may bond with Mr. Murray before the closing credits. Otherwise, we focus on "the CITs" (counselors-in-training). A lot of youthful co-ed skin (but no nudity) mixed with sex talk (but no action) made "Meatballs" a safe hit at the box office. Later camp films lowered the bar.***** Meatballs (6/28/79) Ivan Reitman ~ Bill Murray, Chris Makepeace, Kate Lynch, Russ Banham']
