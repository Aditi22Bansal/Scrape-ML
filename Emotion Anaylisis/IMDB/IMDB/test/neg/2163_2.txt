["What was all the hype about regarding this colossal miserable film?The film starts off too brutal for me with the Indians on the rampage, killing off many of the traders.Am still wondering why Leonardo Di Caprio won the best actor Oscar for this film? He gave many other much better performances in other films. The choice was ridiculous.The one shining spot of this horrible film was the supporting performance by Tom Hardy as the villain, who justified his evil ways by way of religion.This basically comes down to revenge and it's amazing that DiCaprio could ever survive the mauling by that bear to regain the stamina needed to track down Hardy, who had killed his son in the interim.Yes, the scenery is unusual but it best reflects the mood of the entire film."]
