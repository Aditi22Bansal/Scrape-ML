['Is it always good for a son to be like the father? This is a movie based on real events surrounding the disappearance of Kathie McCormack (Dunst). Under mysterious circumstances she disappeared and though her husband Robert (Gosling) was suspected no one was ever brought to trial. The movie opens and we find out that was Robert was seven years old he saw his mom violently die in front of him, and through out the movie we see the effect this had on him. This is a good, but very slow moving movie. This is a different role for Kirsten Dunst, who hasn\'t taken on a part like this since "Virgin Suicides", and she did a good job with it. The movie\'s strength is the performance of Ryan Gosling who is excellent at playing a seemingly normal guy with major psychological issues. It was such a convincing performance that every time he is on screen you will tense up. Overall it was a good movie, but I was expecting more. Acting was really good though. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I don\'t think I would']
