["I don't speak Klingon, I know nothing about the technical specifications of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and I can't recite the complete history of Starfleet. Hell, I don't even know what the correct term for a Star Trek fan is (is it Trekker or Trekkie? Beats me!). I do, however, have an affection for the original TV series, having watched it as a youngster in the 70s (at teatime, after school), and I really wanted to like this film.Oh well...Beyond some clever casting (the majority of the actors assembled here convincingly playing younger versions of the Enterprise's original crew) and the inclusion of some nerdy details designed to appease die-hard Trek fans, this is a failed exerciseâ€”another seriously flawed and over-worked piece of mainstream Hollywood nonsense. The film's unnecessarily complex and confusing time-travel story is riddled with irritating contrivances and plot-holes big enough to fly a Romulan mining craft through, while the rapid editing and an over-reliance on 'everything-including-the kitchen sink' CGI effects only add to the chaos.If this is the standard of film-making we are expected to endure, I can only hope that this rebooted franchise will not 'live long and prosper'."]
