['As the number of us who actually remember the types of gangs portrayed in this movie dwindle, it\'s easy to dismiss it as outdated--even humorous. What one needs to do, however, is consider it on its own merits--some of the most sophisticated music ever written for a musical (Leonard Bernstein). The choreography, gang posturing in your face rhythms, the dancing is breathtaking. Again, nothing is as dated as slang, but, as with Shakespeare, it was the language of the time. Those of you who find it amusing, take a look at current slang 20 years from now. Performances are pretty good although I\'ll never understand how Richard Beymer was selected for such a major role (his filmography is pretty limited) especially since they dubbed in his singing. Natalie Wood works OK but it\'s hard to imagine her a Puerto Rican. The Latins generally outperform the Anglos, but they probably have more to be angry about as characters. There is great tension in the music. When I first got a record of this I listened to it so often I could recite every word of every song. It\'s a fine musical. And, of course, there\'s "Officer Krupke!"']
