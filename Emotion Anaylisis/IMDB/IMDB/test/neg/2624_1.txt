["The Chronicles of Narnia is based on the novels by author C.S. Lewis. The four Pevensie siblings are evacuated from London escaping the blitz. They discover a magical wardrobe which is a gateway to Narnia.It's been a long time since I read the books. I wouldn't say it was my favorite. The big complaint I have is the annoying, dumb, bickering, whiny, and unlikeable kids especially Edmund. It makes it hard to root for them. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) looks like he's always on the verge of an evil plan. Lucy (Georgie Henley) is a yappy little thing. And the two older ones (William Moseley, Anna Popplewell) can't stop bickering.Tilda Swinton overplays the evil White Witch early on. She is so evil that it becomes unreasonable that Edmund couldn't see. It is idiotic. She would be better off playing nicer at the start. The good part is the world of Narnia. It does the job. It has the feel of a slightly magical otherly world that is still reminiscent of the real world. The CGI looks good. With all the different creatures, they look realistic enough."]
