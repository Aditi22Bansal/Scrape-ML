['one of the eccentric films who could be defined as awful movie with few great performances. the pillar remains, after a half of century, Rex Harrison. Richard Burton does his best efforts for define a character who is only a nice sketch of the script. Elizabeth Taylor has just the status of perfect support. for costumes, for lights, for kitsch, for romanticism, for an obscure end, for the title. because its a project of pure ambition to impress. images at first. costumes, people, heroic moments, slices of fake Egypt and few crumbs of acting. too long, too expensive, too strange for the lost of sense in many scenes. picture of the self image of Hollywood, it is only a proof about the ambitions of a period. nothing bad. if the delicate traces of a possible masterpiece are ignored.']
