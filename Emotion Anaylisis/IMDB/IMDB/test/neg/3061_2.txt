["Andrew Jarecki, director of the acclaimed, ambiguous documentary 'Capturing the Friedmans', returns here to the subject of troubled families, with his account of the life of David Marks. The film must come dangerously close to libel, being based on the real life of Robert Durst, who was twice acquitted of murder (suffice it to say Jarecki does not seem so convinced by his plea of innocence). The film begins by painting a sympathetic portrait, of a man bullied by his tyrannical family, but soon begins showing us a less flattering side. Ulimtatley, the story lacks resolution, and a drama extrapolated from the truth like this is always in danger of falling between two stools: one expects a made-up story to attain different standards to one that is merely representing what happened. There's a high-class cast, but ultimately the film lacks both the cohesion of fiction and the compulsion of truth."]
