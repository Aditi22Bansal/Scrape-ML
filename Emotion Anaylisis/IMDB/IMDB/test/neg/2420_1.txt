['\'The Lobster\' is genuinely innovative, at times hilarious, but overall, its abstract. There\'s really nothing here that seems offensive, but I don\'t know what it wants to be. At best, its Funny, but Fk\'ed Up!\'The Lobster\' Synopsis: In a Dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty- five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.I liked \'The Lobster\' to an extent. I liked the bleakness of the near future & the absurdity of its characters. Its a violent story, but a world fumed by havoc. But, overall, I didn\'t understand what this film was trying to say. Sure, its about human dependency, but why the graphic nature & why such an unsatisfying end? I was puzzled once it ended.Efthimis Filippou & Yorgos Lanthimos\'s Screenplay has some great dark humour, but is confused & overstuffed for the most of it. Lanthimos\'s Direction is well-done, as the bleak mood is correctly maintained. Cinematography & Editing are top-class.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell slips into the character & performs with admirable conviction. Also, his overweight appearance adds to his part. Rachel Weisz is ever-marvelous. John C. Reilly is beyond brilliant & is also the film\'s biggest highlight. His "lisping man" is a marvel. Ben Whishaw is okay, while LÃ©a Seydoux oozes menace.On the whole, \'The Lobster\' is a very weird film.']
