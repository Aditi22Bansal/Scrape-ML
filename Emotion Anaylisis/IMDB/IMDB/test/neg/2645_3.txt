["I often struggle with Jack Nicholson, finding his distinctive off-screen persona so evident in his acting that it's hard to for me to accept the bloke as anyone but himself. Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job. Never has Jack's wicked grin been so perfectly suited to a character—not even for the Joker.Of course, it doesn't hurt that the man calling the shots behind the camera was one of the finest film-makers to have ever lived—Stanley Kubrick; if anyone could get a convincing performance from Nicholson, it was going to be Stan. With an unforgettable central turn from its star and flawless direction from Kubrick, The Shining is one of the best horrors of all time, offering stunning camera-work, unsettling music, iconic visuals, and scene upon scene of unbridled suspense and terror. In fact, it's so scary that I find I can even overlook (pun intended) Shelley Duvall's freakishly large eyes and scary teeth, and that's saying something!"]
