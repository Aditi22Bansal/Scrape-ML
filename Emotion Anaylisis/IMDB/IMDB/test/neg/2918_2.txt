["Superb ghost story starring George C Scott as a recently widowed pianist who moves to Seattle in an old mansion. That mansion is haunted by the restless spirit of a male child who will not stop until Scott seeks out the truth regarding his demise. The truths Scott finds along the way are quite stunning. Trish Van Devere plays Claire Norman, the woman who was his Realtor, and assists Scott in his pursuit of the truth. Melvyn Douglas(outstanding in his limited work on screen)is Senator Joseph Carmichael, someone who might have more to do with the ghost's identity than realized.It's everything I expect a good ghost story to be. The camera visuals and lighting of the house(especially that spooky attic Scott finds hidden and closed up where the ghost child's room was)are splendid, but the special effects are also solid. But, it's how the story develops that really worked for me. It isn't merely a special-effects laden exercise, but a legitimate mystery as well.Most ghost stories wish to show off their fancy effects, but this film slowly lets it's spooky stuff happen throughout the film more carefully. Scott is very good(not just sleep-walking like a lot of once-prominent actors tended to do in horror of the 80's)and his traumatic character's past is etched in pain on his face. A perfectly executed film on all counts."]
