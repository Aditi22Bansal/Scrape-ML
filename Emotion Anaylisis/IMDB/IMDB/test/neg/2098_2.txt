['This is a well-acted horror sequel. Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy add some names and class to the gig. Steven King had a minor role as a storekeeper. As in most films, it sticks to the book in some cases while it deviates in others. The special horror effects were excellent. There were too many characters to get emotionally connected to their personal drama, although they made an effort to try as they gathered their tokens.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.']
