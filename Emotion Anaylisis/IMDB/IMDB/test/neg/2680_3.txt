["In memory of Sir Sean Connery, I and Mom decided to watch this-the second James Bond film and one considered a favorite of Connery as well as a few others associated with the series. My mom had mentioned seeing this before when she lived in the Philippines but when watching, she didn't remember any of it! I remember some of the scenes-like on the train-when it showed on ABC during the late '70s, but then the TV screen was green-tinted so it wasn't very clear as it was when we watched part of it on DVD and the rest-because the DVD stopped for some reason-on Amazon Prime. I'll just now say this took some time but gradually, this film got more exciting as it went on toward the end. Especially when that fight with Bond and Rosa Klebb was going on! So on that note, From Russia with Love is still a great James Bond flick!"]
