['This film tells the story of an FBI agent who is given a chance to volunteer to work for a mysterious group of agents to take down a drug lord in Mexico."Sicario" tells a story of agents going into Mexico and carry out attention seeking operations abroad. The film lays out events plainly and in chronological order, but yet there are a lot of pieces missing and hence I have a hard time fully understanding the story. What I get is that Emily Blunt\'s character does not fully know what she is doing, why she is in the team, and she also disagrees with what the team does. She has a lot of questions about the operations, and frankly I have the same questions. As a result, the film is not able to fully captivate me, even though the plot is thrilling and adventurous.']
