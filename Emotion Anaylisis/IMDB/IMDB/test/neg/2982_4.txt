['" . . . Such lovely hair," Frank praises serial killer Wren, who\'s just poisoned him with potassium cyanide. Normally Wren specializes in matricide, as she\'s already killed HER mother and HIS on the very spot Frank\'s expiring. Wren is thoroughly convincing as a 13-year-old murderess. Viewers can picture her becoming some sort of extended care facility employee, or home health care aide, who easily gets away with dozens if not hundreds of "mercy killings." As she raptly soaks in Frank\'s last gasps, the expression on Wren\'s face proves that such moments provide her with the ultimate sensual pleasure. It\'s easy to picture THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE soon morphing into THE ASSASSIN WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY OF WARD B WHO ALWAYS WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT.']
