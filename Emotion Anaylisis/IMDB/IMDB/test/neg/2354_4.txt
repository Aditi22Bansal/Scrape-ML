["Knight and Day is a romantic action comedy film starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.The film is directed by James Mangold.The plot follows the adventures of Roy Miller (Tom Cruise),a spy on the run, and June Havens (Cameron Diaz),a car restorer.He is seen watching Havens, and he bumps into her a couple of times as they go through security at Wichita Airport. While she is making her way back home to Boston from Kansas after picking up spare parts for her deceased father's car that she is restoring for her sister as a wedding gift. Even though she has a confirmed reservation for her flight, she is told at the gate that it is overbooked.The movie follows their adventures across the globe as both run from their perpetrators.The movie was pure fun and nothing more.It was a joy ride as we see a new roles for Cruise and Diaz in comedy.It is also worth mentioning that the chemistry between them seems lacking. I prefer them in together in Vanilla Sky and future drama films rather than this comedy. A 6/10 rating is decent for this film."]
