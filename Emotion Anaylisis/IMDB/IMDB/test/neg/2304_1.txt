['a film like many from last decade. easy, unrealistic, basic story, action and a love story as bonus. it is difficult to be a revelation. but, far to be real bad, it is almost nice, amusing in few scenes, fake in others. important is the idea who seduce, in same measure, the reader and the viewer. and, sure, the role of a long series. in rest, Sci Fi and adventure. or only images from a dream who remains alive for many of adults. a hero out of place, a secret and a war. fight scenes and few drops of romance. nothing original. and basic problem could be not the story - it is only a movie for teenagers- but the option for Hayden Christensen who is not exactly the most inspired David. but the presence of Samuel Jackson in a routine character represents a kind of compensation. like the images. but, out of objections, it is one of films who could open the interest for book. and that is its great virtue.']
