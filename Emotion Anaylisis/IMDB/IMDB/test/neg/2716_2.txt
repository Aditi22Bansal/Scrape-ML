['NATIONAL LAMPOON\'S ANIMAL HOUSE (1978) **** John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Peter Riegert, John Vernon, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst, Donald Sutherland, Karen Allen, James Widdoes, Bruce McGill, Sarah Holcomb, Verna Bloom, Otis Day & the Knights, Kevin Bacon.  Classic comedy about college life circa 1960s that made Belushi a superstar in his most memorable and iconic role: \'professional\' undergrad/uberslob frat pig Bluto Blutarsky, the hard-drinking, frantic and fun-loving heart and soul of Delta House, a broken-down fringe fraternity sect out to make Dean Wormer (Vernon perfectly square-jawed authoritarian s.o.b.) resort to placing them under "double secret probation" resulting in their ultimate retribution: TOGA! TOGA! TOGA! Fast and furiously funny and directed with breakneck elan by John Landis, nostalgic and crazy with some memorable moments including: shooting an R.O.T.C.  horse in the dean\'s office; Hulce\'s angel and devil arguing over a drunken opportunity; Belushi\'s advice to Furst after his frat brothers demolish his older sibling\'s prized car: "My advice to you is...start drinking heavily"; Belushi\'s film vault moment: the food fight of cinema history; the dean\'s credo: "Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life"; and my personal favorite lines: "And For God\'s sake tuck in those pajamas!" by the neo-Nazi Niedermeyer to Flounder and "Nothing\'s over! Was it over when the German\'s bombed Pearl Harbor?!" by Bluto in his rousing the frat rats to war with Omega!']
