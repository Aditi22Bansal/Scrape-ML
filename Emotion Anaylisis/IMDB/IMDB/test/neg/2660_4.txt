['Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in "The Departed," he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem.The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction.The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor.The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops.The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.']
