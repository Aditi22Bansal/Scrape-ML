['Despite my score of 3 for "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", I am NOT saying it is a film to avoid. If you have a theater nearby that allows audience participation (a MUST) or if your local community theater is putting on the play, by all means go! After all, this is a great story to watch with friends and the participation portion can be a lot of fun. But, on its own, it\'s a film that shocks but isn\'t particularly good. A few of the songs are nice but the plot just leaves me flat and the acting, at times, is pretty amateurish. No masterpiece...but it can be fun if seen with like-minded friends.']
