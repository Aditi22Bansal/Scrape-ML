['Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer in the Depression-era South, defends a black man against an undeserved rape charge, and his kids against prejudice.What seems odd about this film is how it was made in the 1960s, looking at the 1930s. What would the same film have been like if it was made in the 1930s? Would the tone be different if not made during the civil rights movement? And, in some small way, did this film help push that movement forward? Now, this is not to say it is a bad film. It is a very good, and very timeless film. Bigotry is not dead, not by a long shot. And the belief that everyone deserves a strong defense should never go away, whether they are guilty or innocent, black or white, rich or poor.']
