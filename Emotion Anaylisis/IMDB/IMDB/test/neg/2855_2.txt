['ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is a wonderful example of what can be achieved with a talented director on a very low budget. My only criticisms are  the plothole of having the gangs hiding so they aren`t discovered by police patrol cars ( I thought that`s what the gangs would have wanted - a toe to toe war with " the pigs " ) , the ending which is something of an anti-climax but knowing the budget this is understandable . John Carpenters best film and his best score Dum dum dum du du dum , dum dah dah du du dum']
