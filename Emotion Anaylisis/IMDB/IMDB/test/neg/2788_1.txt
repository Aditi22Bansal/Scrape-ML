['A village has been hounded by bandits who come in to steal their rice and barley. Sick of it, they decide to hire a samurai to protect them before the next raid. Soon, the number grows to seven... and the bandits have a heck of fight on their hands.Akira Kurosawa is a master, both in writing and directing. Some have compared this film to Orson Welles\' "Citizen Kane" for its greatness. And surely, we have seen many, many directors and films who have expressed their admiration -- sometimes in words, sometimes by imitation.The film has been said to be the first where an assembled group of men go on a mission. That may well be true. I find it even more impressive that Kurosawa was able to make such a production so relatively soon after World War II, when Japan should have been struggling with recovery. Indeed, the filming quality is not up to American standards for 1954, but he more than makes due with what he has.I really need to see the film again to get a fair assessment of it, but I enjoyed it greatly and think it needs more exposure.']
