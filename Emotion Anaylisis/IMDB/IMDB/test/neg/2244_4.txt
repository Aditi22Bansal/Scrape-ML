["If ever there is a real movement to curb the excess of violence in films, this should be the standard to show as an example.There is enough shooting and other forms of violence all over the place including dance halls, the church, on the street, you name it.The story in itself gets lost with all the violence that takes place. Everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazing.When a killer's wife dies, Keanu Reeves, the grief stricken widower, is soon robbed of his car and his beloved dog put to death by the son of a fellow gangster. As a result, all hell breaks loose and nothing is spared.This is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected."]
