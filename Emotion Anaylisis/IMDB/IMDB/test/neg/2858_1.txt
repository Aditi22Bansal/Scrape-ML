["Samuel Ratchett(Richard Windmark)asks Poirot(Albert Finney, having a field day as the sleuth)to be his bodyguard after receiving several death threats. He is later found dead and Poirot discovers quite a secret..Ratchett is indeed a notorious gangster Cassetti, the mastermind behind a kidnapping gone awry with the end result being the death of little girl Daisey Armstrong. Everyone on board is suspect as Poirot, with help by Signor Bianchi(the wonderful Martin Balsam)and Dr. Constantine(George Coulouris), will pursue the truth through a complex investigation that gets muddied when clues of a possible killer emerge as a concierge suit(a missing button from the suit is later found with a key to all the rooms hidden in the pocket)is found as well as the dagger. Through a collection of testimonials from each passenger on board, Poirot puts together his case.This film, as slickly directed by Lumet, does show the viewer little cues before and after the murder takes place who might've possibly done it. The opening set-up with the Armstrong family is a bit elusive, but after you watch the interrogations, Lumet allows you to understand what that opening montage of clips and such means. This cast is simply awesome, definitely the best I've seen assembled and that alone is novelty to re-watch this over and over. I consider it one of the all-time greatest entertainments. A good old fashioned mystery to escape into for two hours."]
