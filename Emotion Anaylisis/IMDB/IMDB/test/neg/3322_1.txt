["Battlefield Earth (2000): Dir: Roger Christian / Cast: John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Kelly Preston, Kim Coates: One of the lowest forms of idiocy since Roger Christian's previous crap Masterminds. It addresses the idea of earth as a wasteland in a screenplay that goes from bad to worse right up to its ridiculous conclusion where violence solves everything. Idiot plot regards man as an endangered species made slaves to the nine-foot tall Psychos who is the head security adviser wishing to leave Earth but his request is turned down. To get revenge he secretly has human slaves dig mines so that he may possess the gold for himself. Among the slaves is Barry Pepper who was on an expedition from his village before his capture. Horrible directing by Christian with John Travolta delivering one of his worst performances. He even sounds bad delivering dialogue that consists of name calling. Barry Pepper spends much time dangling from Travolta's grasp. Forest Whitaker plays Travolta's henchman and that is about the height of his involvement. Kelly Preston appears in a cameo because when you're married to the film's star then it is only right that you suffer for the same bad career decisions. The production values are well done otherwise the extent of the screenplay seems to be a pointless ugly stupid mess. This film should be tossed in a bomb fire. Score: 2 / 10"]
