['Deja Vu all over this place. The list of Movies that are the "Inspiration", to be kind, are ones that make the A-List of most Sci-Fi Fans. So here we go again and again, and once more, again just to be sure.It is quite Ironic that these End of the World Films can make an uninhabitable Earth look so Cool as to be Postcard worthy. That does make for a more pleasant Experience. But beneath all that, to be considered it must have a Story that tickles the Mind and makes Wonders of the Imagination. But here there are twist and turns, revelations and redirections that were better served Decades ago by Rod Serling and Stan Lee. This is so familiar that we feel, as the Movie unreels, that We are visiting an old Dear Friend, that is no Wiser with Age.Overall, this is a watchable wannabee that tries to make its mark in the New Age, but borrows way to much from the Old School and makes it look like a wrinkled old Story with a face-lift. All smooth and shiny but suffering from Post-Operative Artificiality. This is really a good looking Clone of a Clone of a Clone. It is real, but is it? A Soul cannot be manufactured.']
