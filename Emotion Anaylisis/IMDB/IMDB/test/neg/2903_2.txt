["The games people play. Throughout this entire film (based on an intense play by Edward Albee), we are never sure what the truth is. George and Martha have a marriage made in hell. They have an intense hatred of one another fueled by years of disappointment. Then again, perhaps this is how they express their love. Enter Sandy Dennis and George Segal who believe they are attending a quiet evening with an again professor and his wife. They are soon drawn into the clutches of these two. Elizabeth Taylor, with weight packed on to do the role, and Richard Burton, two cinema icons, strut their stuff, leading the poor souls who have wandered into the web with tales and sparks and deception. Dennis is a mousy little thing who tries to cope, but we can see her eroding each minute she is in this hornet's nest. This is one of America's great stage plays and the movie really does it justice. Was Taylor a great actress. You bet she was. And Burton. Oh yeah!"]
