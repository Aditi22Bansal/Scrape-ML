["Way over produced and exaggerated, this overrated Movie has a number or funny bits and some bouncy Music, some of it by real Soul and R&B greats, but it is also filled with so many car crashes that it wrecks the momentum. There could easily be 45 minutes cut in the form of unnecessary big budget, obligatory scenes and this would be a more enjoyable Musical/Comedy. As it is, there is so much that is disjointed and destructive that it literally collapses onto itself with over indulgence and unrestrained tomfoolery.Worth a view for the better parts, but be prepared to endure endless repetition, mostly of the vehicular nature. Aykroyd and Belushi were naturals on SNL and other projects, but this big production didn't do them any favors in the creative department because they were buried in so much rubble."]
