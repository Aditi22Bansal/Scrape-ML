["My track record with Disney cartoons is erratic to say the least. As a child I saw a few of the early ones as and when they came up, Snow White, Pinnochio, Bambi, then a long gap. As far as I recall the last one I saw was The Little Mermaid in which I recall a couple of half decent numbers, Under The Sea being one. When Frozen was released this week in the UK it garnered money reviews from about half the critics, some of which praised the score, so I thought what the hey. It didn't exactly live up to those reviews, at least not in my book, and the score certainly contained nothing to equal Under The Sea but nevertheless it was well done and on the whole entertaining. The Elsa character just about justified the title of Snow Queen but Hans Anderson would have been hard put to recognise any of it as his original story. Kids, of course, won't worry about provenance and there are some adults who'll find it easy to take."]
