['And his brand new invention is acting. Although you could argue the point that playing oneself might not be considered acting, I can\'t really tell, because I don\'t know who the real "Vanilla Ice" is. What I can say is that he almost steals the entire movie from established actors. And he\'s not shying back on making fun of himself. In a good way that is. Sandler and Samberg on the other hand sound way better on paper than they are on screen.Don\'t get me wrong, compared to "Jack and Jill" (or some of his/Adams other lame comedies) this looks like a masterpiece! But the trailer did suggest more fun than you actually might have. Some odd cameos (Adam always gets whoever he wants to or at least it looks that way) that I won\'t spoil are fun and the tone gets set pretty early on. The R-rating is there for a reason and it touches a nice subject matter. Of course you won\'t get too deep into the whole thing (no pun intended), but it makes for awkward (=fun?) comedy time.It\'s really predictable, but if you let yourself enjoy it (and you will know if it is for you right off the bat!), you will have a good time watching it']
