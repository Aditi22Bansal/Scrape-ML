['Readers of the Suzanne Collins novels we not overjoyed to have Mockingjay to be split into two parts; but that is movie business. Squeeze every drop out of a product you can. Dragged-out and anti-climatic, but yet loud, lavish and albeit entertaining. The main thing in common to quantify success is Miss Jennifer Lawrence.My favorite and probably best sequence in MOCKINGJAY - Part 2, features Katniss(Lawrence)and a selected band of rebels tromping through subterranean sewers of the capitol, when they are attacked by ghostly white and slimy lizard mutts. Katniss is warned not to trust anyone. The whole intent of this episode is to conclude the revolution by dethroning and killing the tyrannical President Snow(Donald Sutherland). The finale may be a tad bittersweet and less fulfilling than hoped. But the Hunger Games have ended.Credit Peter Craig and Danny Strong for the adapted screenplay and kudos to director Francis Lawrence. Jeniffer Lawrence earned and deserves any and all accolades thrown at her feet. She is THE HUNGER GAMES. An astounding supporting cast features: Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Jullianne Moore, Mahershala Ali, Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci.']
