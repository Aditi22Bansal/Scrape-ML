['Wholesome woman leaves Austrian convent and goes to be governess for a captain\'s children right before the Nazis take over Austria. Go figure! As it was, I spent most of "The Sound of Music" throwing out the sort of comments that Mike, Servo and Crow hurl at the grade-Z movies that Dr. Forrester sends them on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie "The Sound of Mucus" - I thought to myself: "So that\'s the guy from \'The Return of the Pink Panther\', \'Dragnet\', \'Dolores Claiborne\', \'The Insider\' and \'Syriana\'?" As for Julie Andrews, she basically reprises her "Mary Poppins" role. And considering that it was Austria, we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty.For the record, one of the "Simpsons" comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals (including this one) with songs about killing Bart Simpson. And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe, they eventually settled in Vermont. I wonder, could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry? Anyway, "TSOM" isn\'t terrible; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century. I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise (RIP) for "West Side Story".']
