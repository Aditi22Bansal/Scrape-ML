['The original and probably the best of the series dealing with the anti-Christ child who reeks havoc on the lives of his parents, presidential aspirant and ambassador, Gregory Peck and his lovely, but troubled wife-Lee Remick.As the child gets older, the woes of his parents worsen and why not. He was destined to destroy them to move closer to his ultimate goal of world control.As the sinister governess, Billie Whitelaw is excellent is conveying the emotion of an evil woman.The ending is quite predictable. Nobody allows a child to get stabbed to death under Hollywood standards.While adequate for the part, Peck seems uncomfortable when not acting in films of social consciousness. This film is more like social horror.']
