["It can be debated that this is the best boxing movie of all time. Never the less, Martin Scorsese delivers a masterful story based on Jake LaMotta's book. We get to see the rough, raw and rowdy story of LaMotta's(Robert De Niro)rise to the middleweight championship and his self-destructive exit from the glory and limelight. Great boxing scenes and unabashed emotional acting make this movie the masterpiece it is. De Niro is at the top of his game and probably plays one of his most memorable characters. Cathy Moriarty plays Jake's wife and kudos to Joe Pesci as Joey LaMotta, Jake's brother. Notable support from Nicholas Colasanto and Theresa Sadana. This sad, but triumphant film should not be missed. You get the punch for your bucks with this one."]
