["this movie is pretty bad.i haven't been this bored in a long time.Alec Baldwin must have been into the sauce when he agreed to do this thing.it's marketed as a kid's movie with a PG rating,but this really isn't a kid's movie.there is some very adult language implied.yet it is not a movie for adults either,because it is so juvenile.so,really this movie is not suitable for anyone.By the way,Mike Meyers looks like a complete idiot as the cat.this movie doesn't strike me as being very faithful to the spirit of the children's book by Dr.Seuss. the only other thing i can say about this movie is it is colourful.otherwise,there is no good reason for anyone to watch this movie.a weak 1/10"]
