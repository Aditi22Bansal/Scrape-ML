['Having grown up with G.I. Joe cartoons on TV, I just had to see this movie. And I must say that I am left with mixed feelings.First of all, this is a splendid action movie with lots of cool stuff going on. Lots of shooting, martial arts, explosions and all that makes for a good action movie.However, there is very little G.I. Joe feel to the movie. Sure they have the same names as the ones in the cartoons (and comic books), sure they have the gadgets, but something is missing. That whole "real American hero" feel is lacking from this movie. And that is what drags this movie down.The cast is good, lots of good performances here. But at times the dialogue is halting, coming off a cheesy or clumsy.Watch it for what it is; a good action movie. Forget that you have seen the G.I. Joe cartoons (or read the comic books). With that out of your head you will be thoroughly entertained by the movie. If you go into this movie with G.I. Joe in your heart, you are in for somewhat of a disappointment.I give my rating based on the action movie aspect of the movie, having decided to overlook its lack of the true spirit of G.I. Joe.']
