["Spike Jonze the writer and director of Her appeared on a British news show to promote it and instead of answering questions, he kept asking the news presenter what she thought of the film who appeared to be diplomatic in her answers.I have no need to be diplomatic, this is a poor film. Maybe his usual collaborator Charlie Kaufman could had written a more involving film but this is dull.Joaquin Phoenix and a less glam Amy Adams reunite from 'The Master.' Phoenix plays a talented letter writer in the near future going through a divorce and falls in love with an advanced operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Although its implied Phoenix is lonely we never get a good reason why he falls for such a virtual relationship which makes the film creepy.We have had similar themes film done before and done better. The cheesy 'Electric Dreams' from 30 years ago and 'SimOne' from a decade ago.Phoenix after his turn in 'The Master' gets to play a more introverted, restrained person which he does very well.The location shooting was a mixture of Los Angeles and Shanghai which give the film a futuristic sheen, good use of music but the film is a failure."]
