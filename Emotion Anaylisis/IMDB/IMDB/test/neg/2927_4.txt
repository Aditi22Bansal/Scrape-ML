['OK, but not great. Music (by the Bee Gees) is fantastic, and the dance sequences are great. However, the human drama side is pretty uneventful and mostly quite dull. The characters, including the leads, are mostly so loathsome it is hard to feel any empathy.Performances are so-so. John Travolta does well in the lead role, seeming to inhabit the character. No real stand-outs, otherwise.Not a great movie, but a great piece of nostalgia from the disco days of the 1970s.']
