["I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and I was very disappointed by this film. It is not the format - TV series and miniseries can do wonders in the science fiction genre - just take the examples of 'Earth 2' or 'Jericho' or even 'Dune' which had to compete with a David Lynch feature film. Here we are dealing with a bad treatment for one of the best novels in the history of the genre.Almost everything is wrong here. The first novel signed by Crichtonwith his own name gets an actualization where we see once again a TV president of the United States quite far from the charisma and power his position should have, we see villain generals plotting against the nation and the world with an unbelievable stupidity and a team of scientists that endlessly debate in cryptic techno-slang while never caring to make us feel for them, neither when they debate the fate of the planet, nor when they kiss, nor when they die. Effects are average minus, and it is only the basic skeleton of the Crichton story and the classic idea of his about mankind as the wizard apprentice that opens the Pandora box of science that gives the action some consistency and interest. The good film that this fabulous novel deserves is yet to be made."]
