["I'm going to say that I didn't understand whether the film was really a dream or a real one, but it's definitely a dream. Real people can only describe a human life in such a cliché fiction using characters. Actors were awful in the movie, so I didn't expect acting. I watched the film without prejudice, but I became a cringe.\nThe film didn't have much comedy. It has been edited with fiction that has similar films everywhere and it has been really distant.\nIt would be better for everyone to tell the truth. The film has nowhere to be commended. Failed and cliché."]
