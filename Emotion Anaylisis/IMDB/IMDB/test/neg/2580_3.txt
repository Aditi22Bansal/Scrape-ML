['it is not easy to define it as a good or bad movie. because it is only part of a trend. for YA series who are the same in their essence. for the themes who are the same manner, style who defines each. few young actors. and a challenge. nothing new from Jules Verne to our present. maybe, only the ambition to say a story for generations far by classic stories. the result - a cold, not very convincing film about old values , references to Lord of Flies and technology as ingredient of an obscure dark utopia. a film almost decent. but untasted, conventional and far by credibility.with precise target, it is not surprising to not be the best choice for high expectations. because , like the adapted series, like many others series for young people, it is only a surrogate.']
