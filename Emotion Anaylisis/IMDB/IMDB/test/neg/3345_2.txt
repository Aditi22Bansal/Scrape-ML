['Wow, bad doesn\'t quantify. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation almost demands a whole new rating system.It\'s crazy that I know many of these actors from other things, which they\'re good in. Yet had no recollection of any of them being in this. Going from the greatest video-game adaption ever, to something close to a school production/SyFy channel film. I see this same director ruined another great sequel opportunity with "The Butterfly Effect 2" also, DAMN YOU!']
