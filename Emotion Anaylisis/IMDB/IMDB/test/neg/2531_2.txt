['In 2005, the Private Joe Bauers (Luke Wilson) is an ordinary man with an average IQ. He is invited by Officer Collins (Mike McCafferty) to participate of a classified program named Human Hibernation Project to hibernate in pods for one year with the whore Rita (Maya Rudolph). However Collins is arrested for participating in a prostitution ring and Joe and Rita are forgotten in the pods. Five hundred years later, Joe wakes up and finds that the society is absolutely dumb. But he is arrested since he does not have any money or identification. In the prison, he is submitted to an IQ test and soon he learns that he is the most intelligent guy in the United States. President Camacho (Terry Alan Crews) invites him to join his government and help him to resolve the problem with the crop. In return, he would give pardon for his faults. Joe requests the support of Rita and the lawyer Frito (Dax Shepard) that will show him a Time Machine. Joe tries to solve the crop problem and then return to his time."Idiocracy" is one of the funniest and most intelligent comedies that I have recently. The storyline is perfect and I am afraid that one day, we will reach this dystopia with the actions of demagogue and populist governments. This movie should be mandatory in classes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Idiocracia" ("Idiocracy")']
