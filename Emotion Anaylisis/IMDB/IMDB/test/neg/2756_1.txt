["I was slightly disappointed considering Dario Argento's reputation. It is said SUSPIRIA may be the best Italian horror flick. The story line is not really clear at times and definitely not obvious. Special effects are pretty gory and the music is really good and sets a scary atmosphere. The opening sequence is a bit mysterious, but makes sense when the finale plays out. To be exact, the final fifteen minutes or so are the best of the whole movie. The sets resemble nothing I've seen before. Shadows usually nurture fear.An American dancer enters a renowned European ballet academy to waltz into an eerie situation. A secret door is opened and leads to the discovery that the staff is a wicked coven with intentions of gaining converts. It is sensed the newcomer must be eliminated and become part of the ever growing body count. Starring are: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Alida Valli, Flavio Bucci, Udo Kier and veteran actress Joan Bennett."]
