["I watched a few episodes. I couldn't watch any more because I could feel the bile rising to my throat.\nAll the while my thoughts were 'this must be what southern baptist are like'.Watch the interview with Rick Kirkham for behind the scenes stories. Then you will understand my statement above.As for stars - none! IMDB should be offering minus stars."]
