['Henri "Papillon (butterfly)" Charierre (Steve McQueen) is a safecracker who claims to be innocent of murdering a pimp. He is sentenced to life and imprisoned in the notorious penal colony in French Guyana. On the voyage there, he offers his bodyguard services to forger Louis Degas (Dustin Hoffman) who sold fake government bonds. Degas has enemies like the prison guard who has family that lost money in the fake bonds. Papillon vows to escape. The colony conditions are horrific. He is put into solitary confinement but he continues to plan for his escape.This is possibly McQueen\'s best performance. Sure he\'s the cool guy but he gets to do a lot more. He gets to be weak in solitary and he gets to be old in the last act. Hoffman injects great comedic chemistry for the duo. There is great gallows humor early on. The crocodile scene is shocking and hilarious. There are great touching moments. And that cliff jump is insane. That\'s a thrill only a real stunt gives.']
