['Brooding plot with a wonderful atmosphere of heavy rain and doom mark this film.While the acting is good by all concerned, you just know from the eerie beginning that the tables shall be turned on the supposed investigators. Is Leo Di Caprio living in a dream world, living a tragic fantasy or being taken to the cleaners? I thought of the 1944 "Gas Light," when Charles Boyer was trying to drive wife Ingrid Bergman insane.That\'s what this appeared like until reality set in.For a film regarding mental institutions, we see very little acting out on the part of the inmates.']
