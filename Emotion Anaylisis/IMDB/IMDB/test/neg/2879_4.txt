['Usually, we think of Wes Craven\'s movies as really cool. "The Hills Have Eyes" would likely be the one that splits people. An absolutely disgusting story of an all-American family getting stranded in a desert inhabited by cannibals, the movie leaves nothing to the imagination. There may be points in the movie where you have to remind yourself that it\'s only a movie; some of the scenes they really could have done without.Still, if we accept this as a cheap \'70s exploitation flick, then it\'s not bad at all. But I must warn you, only watch it if you have a very strong stomach. And yes, that\'s Dee Wallace (aka ET\'s mom) as Lynne.']
