['It was the recent ad campaign for the sequel that brought "Hotel Transylvania" to my attention (much to the delight of my five-year-old), but the movie never really gets above "eh". It has the usual stale kids\' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it\'s a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it\'s short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there\'s an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).My kid liked it, so the movie\'s got that going for it. But for entertainment that offers multi-generational appeal, I\'ll have to look elsewhere.5/10']
