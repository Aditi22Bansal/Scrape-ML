['Important, Vibrant, and Clunky...Loud, Choppy and Amateurish...Ambitious, Influential, and Insufferable. The First Part of the Mad Max Trilogy was a Huge International Hit but Viewing it Today seems Tame, Albeit Adventurous. It Reeks of Film Student Excesses with a Similar Lack of Restraint. The Sound Levels Waver Inconsistently and Much of the Dialog and other Sounds are Mixed so Badly that it Reminds at Times of Early Porno.But it has Guts and Glory. Not Edited very well or Wholly Coherent, the Total Package does Deliver a Limited Rewarding Experience. It is Roughly Made but it sets the Standard for Itself so High that it Only Occasionally Reaches its Lofty Goals.A Drive-In, Grindhouse Perennial the Movie made Mel Gibson a Star and Started a Post Apocalyptic, Dystopian B-Movie Trend. The Sequel, The Road Warrior or Mad Max 2 (1981) is Probably the Movie Director George Miller wanted to make in the First Place and is a much more Accomplished, Professional Film All Around.Heavily Flawed but Nevertheless Made its Mark and is Considered a Cult Classic.']
