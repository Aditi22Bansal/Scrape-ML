["Mediocrity in All its Pumped Up Glory is on Display here as Two Hot Shot Hollywood A-List Stars don't Manage Much Chemistry on Screen despite the Real Life Couple's Attachment. The Sparks don't Ignite Unless of course You Count the Number of Bullets Ricocheting all over the place. Those Multitudes of Highly Trained Assassin Bullets that Never Seem to Hit the Target.The Intrigue that was Inherent in the Story Dissipates by the Second Half and then Things Really become Clich√©d and Boring. This is a Classic Misfire where the Ingredients are there but Never Quite Coalesce into a Complete and Entertaining Sum of the Parts that Suckered You into Giving this One a Go.Nothing is Remotely Believable and that may be the Point of this Modern Romantic Hybrid but when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are Beating each other to a Pulp or Pumping Rounds of Explosives all Over the House it just becomes as Ineffective as the Final Shootout that goes on for so Long that it is just gets Silly and not in a Good Way.There are a Few Spots in the Movie that can be Slightly Amusing but not Enough to Justify this Overblown Production and the Marriage Dysfunction ends up being a Metaphor for this Movie's Production."]
