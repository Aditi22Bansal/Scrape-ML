["Well, a friend of mine told me to watch this flick. Because it had so many good reviews and a good score. Was I disappointed at the end of this horror. It was to be honest a rather slow movie. For me before things really go awry I had to wait almost 45 minutes. And even then it just wasn't scary. Don't get. me wrong. The idea was okay and the way it was shot was also sublime but the story just couldn't get my attention.Maybe it was the CGI used for the whitening of the eyes that made it laughable or all the possessed ones towards the end that made it a bit ridiculous that made me almost stop watching it. Again, the story was okay but too slow and laughable effects to really say this was a good old horror. Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"]
