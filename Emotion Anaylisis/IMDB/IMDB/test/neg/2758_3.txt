['What has all the fuss been about with this movie? Can somebody tell me? This was not scary. It was just stupid, with no-name "fair" actors, at best. The dialog is laughable; the special-effects are too dated to be taken seriously in 2008 (actually, by the 1980s, too). Some films get get reputations early on and all the national critics follow like sheep, giving you the same unwarranted hype about how great a film is, and this "Night Of The Living Dead" is a perfect example of that. A horror movie is supposed to raise a few hairs on the back of your neck, not put you to sleep. These "zombies" look like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin - maybe that\'s why it\'s gotten rave reviews.Trust me, this is a total waste of time.']
