["Joe Gillis (William Holden) is found shot and floating in the swimming pool of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Blvd. Six months earlier, Joe is a struggling screenwriter trying to sell his run-of-the-mill movie to producer Sheldrake but script reader Betty Schaefer belittles it. He's on the run from repo men and he hides his car in an old mansion. The mansion's owner turns out to be silent era movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She has delusions of making a 'return' to star in her script of Salome for legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Joe sees an easy way to make some money doing a rewrite. Slowly but surely, he becomes her kept man.Gloria Swanson gives an iconic performance for the ages. Her scenes on the Paramount lot are riveting. William Holden is great. It's a fascinating dissection of Hollywood and the fame obsession. There are a few moments of over-acting by some of the other actors which is weird since the movie is about the passing of the silent era acting. Norma Desmond has to be one of the top characters of all times."]
