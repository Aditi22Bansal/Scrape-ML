['This remake simply shouldn\'t have been, there was no need to make it or expand on an already competent original.I\'d heard nothing but bad things and I fully understand why. It\'s not that it\'s poorly made, it\'s just so very mundane.Standing at over 4hrs split across 3 episodes this remake misses the point of the original story altogether. Gone are the iconic scenes including the blood filled elevator and creepy twins, gone is the bike down the corridor or dead lady seducing the father. And no there isn\'t a "Here\'s Johnny" moment.It\'s all replaced with lack of originality and mediocrity.The cast do their best but nobody could have turned this around, it simply should never have been.Cliched, boring and I don\'t mean to be harsh but that kid looks like he ingested the whole ugly tree.Plain and simply bad.The Good:The cast do a decent enough jobThe Bad:Kid is just awfulEnding is far fetchedPoor writingWhole thing is just so unecessaryThings I Learnt From This Movie:The classics need leaving the hell alone']
