["A sniper (Andrew Robinson) is hunting the city of San Francisco. He calls himself Scorpio demanding a $100k ransom. The Mayor (John Vernon) plays along agreeing to pay despite Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood)'s objections. While having lunch, he witnesses a bank robbery and takes down the crooks. He has the nickname Dirty Harry because he hates everybody. Chico Gonzalez is his new partner with his old one still in the hospital.The investigation meanders a bit early on. He goes off in different directions. He even gets to go talk down a jumper. First he berates him and then he knocks him out. Non of it matters because Dirty Harry is such a compelling new character. He's a movie icon for the ages. He's the gruff inappropriate police detective and a terrific role for Clint Eastwood."]
