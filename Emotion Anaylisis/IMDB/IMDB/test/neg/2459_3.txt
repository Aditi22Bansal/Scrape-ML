['A secret agent (Byung-hun Lee) tracks a vicious murderer (Min-Sik Choi) who killed his fiancee. I SAW THE DEVIL takes the serial killer tale and turns it upside down (and inside out!).If you\'re expecting another "psychopath vs. The police / cat and mouse" story, this movie will be a surprise. ISTD uses this premise, only to expand on it, resulting in one of the best revenge films ever made. You might even catch yourself feeling -sort of- sorry for the killer!Unlike most such films, this one goes a long way in showing the ultimate price of vengeance. Both protagonist and antagonist are relentless, leading to a finale that is as thought-provoking as it is visceral. If you love movies like LADY VENGEANCE, OLDBOY, etc., then you\'ll probably enjoy this...']
