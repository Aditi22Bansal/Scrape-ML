['The Haunting of Blay Manor (2020) was recently released on Netflix and was the followup to The Haunting on Hill House (2018). The storyline focused on an American teacher and nanny who interviews and receives a nanny job in the English countryside of two children who have had a tragic life. As she moves in she starts seeing weird things happening all around her and the children. The series tells us the story of Bly House as the nanny experiences it and has subplots around the children and nanny\'s past. Mike Flanagan is the writer of Bly House. He also wrote The Haunting of Hill House and Gerald\'s Games for Netflix and he wrote the screenplay for Doctor Sleep as well. I think the concept for this series tried to take the family element that worked so well in Hill House, switch the concept from a family to a love story, and deliver a "deep" ghost story to wow audiences again...it didn\'t work. This was painful to get through. There were hardly any horror elements and this was really just a series of several love stories woven together. This was very disappointing. I may only give this series one more chance. If the next season is this bad we will take a serious hiatus from this franchise. I\'d give this a 3/10.']
