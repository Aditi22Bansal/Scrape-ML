['Halloween 2 (2009): Dir: Rob Zombie / Cast: Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif, Danielle Harris, Sheri Moon Zombie: Starts off where the first film left off just as the original Halloween 2 began where the original Halloween left off. Director Rob Zombie takes a different path by going ahead a few years and using only the first act to reference the substantial hospital scenes in the original Halloween 2. This is effective because in the original sequel, Myers is reduced to a zombie like stalker in hospital corridors. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis survives the attacks from the previous film but unlike Donald Pleasence, he turns the character into a fame seeker selling his book about his encounters. This adds some humour as well as critical reception when he is accused of exploiting the murders. How Loomis is ultimately dealt with is another lame and graphic encounter with Myers. Scout Taylor-Compton as victim Laurie Stroud is given more to do. The Sheriff finds her that night and after extreme therapy she is living with him and his daughter Annie. She discovers her birth right before she ultimately visits a Smiths Grove. Brad Dourif plays the Sheriff while Danielle Harris plays his rebellious ill fated daughter. Sheri Moon Zombie appears briefly as mother Myers leading a white horse about. Visually well made alteration of the original sequel. Score: 4 Â½ / 10']
