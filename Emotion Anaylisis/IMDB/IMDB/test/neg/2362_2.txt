["It follows breaks the mould of modern horrors, by lacking gore, blood and the usual set of rules. Instead this film moves at a slower pace, and relies on storytelling and the dying art of suspense. A quite unusual storyline, which sees some unknown being torment it's victim perpetually, with only them able to see it, with the victim followed day and night without any let up. The only way to escape the grips of the being, to sleep with someone and pass the curse on, or so the theory goes anyhow. A pretty clever story with lots of twists. Well acted with some decent characters. The film has one help of an accompanying soundtrack, which is straight out of the eighties, big and brash, I loved it, worked so well for the film. Some great moments, most notably the beach scene, slow and very deliberate. If you've watched Torchwood, you'll know why I was reminded of an early episode.Really good film 8/10"]
