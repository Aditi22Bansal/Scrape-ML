['Considered in Some Circles to be the First "Slasher" Movie.But this Type of Declaration is Fraught with Opinionated Opportunism.It is the One-Film that Created the "Holiday" Horror Movie.No Holiday is more Sacrosanct then "Christmas" and is why Bob Clark Changed the Original Title from "Stranger in the House".The Movie is quite Accomplished Artistically Apart from the Usually Uninspired Creation from Low-Budget "Band Wagon", Bottom-Line Imitators.The Atmosphere and Look of the Movie has a Colorful Quality and Takes Advantage of Holiday Trappings and Festivity.Alcohol Plays a Prominent Influence On-Screen and even has Margot Kidder (who insisted of drinking real alcohol during filming) Dispensing Drinks to a Minor.The Film also Includes Lewd and Profane Dialog.The Contemporaneous "Real Life" Serial Killings had Authorities and Other Overly Pius People Loudly Voicing Protests.Overall, the Movie does Deserve Accolades for Delivering its Low-Budget (around $600,000) Horror-Show with Style and Cutting-Edge Cinematic Ingredients that would be Imitated Ad-Nausea for Decades.With an Attention to Detail, for the Artistic Flourishes and its Trend-Setting the Movie is Essential for Horror Buffs. For Others its...Worth a Watch.']
