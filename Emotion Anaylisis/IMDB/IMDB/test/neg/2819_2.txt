['Cary Grant a recently married confirmed bachelor is spending his honeymoon with his crazy family as he discovers his aunts are at the forefront of euthanasia. His brother Jonathan (Raymond Massey) comes to visit, dragging along Peter Lorre and a corpse. John Alexander believes he is Teddy Roosevelt and buries yellow fever victims in the basement "canal."This was a delightful comedy. I was confused by the opening claiming to be Halloween and a baseball game was being played. There was no mention of Halloween in the feature.']
