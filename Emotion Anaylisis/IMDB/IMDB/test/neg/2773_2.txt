["While many movies around that time, made sci-fi movies with evil aliens that tried to invade the earth (Danger from above stuff), this movie dared to be more philosophical. And it succeeds in doing so. The message is there, the acting is good (not only for a sci-fi movie) and it doesn't hammer the message into your head. It's stoic and it's slow moving, it doesn't have frenetic action, but it stays with you, even though it's not flawless.The movie is really good and it really wasn't necessary to make a Remake ... but the went ahead and made one in 2008. While they said they'd make an update on the whole thing, the Original is still the one to look out for!"]
