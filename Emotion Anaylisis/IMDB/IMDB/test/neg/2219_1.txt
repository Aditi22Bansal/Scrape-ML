['I have to admit that I was initially fearing that "Jennifer\'s Body" was going to be another generic teenage horror movie. But luckily it turned out to transcend mediocrity and be more than an average teenage horror.It was because of the cast that I had feared as much. I mean, Megan Fox, come on. But she actually stepped up to the plate and delivered where it counted, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.The story is about a girl who catch a ride with some questionable Guys. And fearing her gone, her friend is relieved to find her coming back home. But Jennifer is not the same person anymore; she is so much more.As for the story, well, it wasn\'t revolutionary to the horror genre by any means, but it was entertaining. And it delivered where it had to.The practical effects were quite good, as were the special effects. The slow breakdown of Jennifer\'s body throughout the movie was particularly impressive.I have seen this movie twice now, granted with years in between, but the movie does have enough contents to sustain more than just a single viewing.']
