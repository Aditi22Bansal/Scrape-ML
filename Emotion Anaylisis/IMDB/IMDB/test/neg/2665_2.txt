['My mom said that when "The Exorcist" first came out, she thought that it was the scariest thing that she\'d ever seen ("The Shining" later overtook it). When I saw the 2000 re-release...well, let\'s just say that you don\'t know intensity until you\'ve seen that version! Since everyone knows what happens, I\'ll just talk about a few aspects. Nowadays, it\'s a little shocking to us that the opening scene happens in Iraq. Fr. Karras\' (Jason Miller) first name is Damian, which was later the boy\'s name in "The Omen". I believe that it was around the time when this movie came out that Ellen Burstyn was active in the campaign to free Rubin "Hurricane" Carter from jail. Linda Blair later spoofed her own character in "Repossessed", co-starring Leslie Nielsen. Anyone hungry for pea soup?']
