["I wouldn't say that Donald Sutherland is my favorite actor. What he shows here though, although very good, does spoil the movie. Why you ask? Because whenever he's on screen, you get the feeling, what real acting is like! He could've centred the movie, but he's shown to little in it, to help it (this was of course on purpose, to elevate his performance, when he's on screen), on the contrary he's spoiling it!The other actors (most of them younger) are good or rather can be good, and they showed it in other movies (I'm sure), but not here. But that's not all, the back and forth on many subjects on display here and the direction of the movie (which I don't really see getting anywhere, without taking too many detours), destroy all the romance that could've been there (or indeed was there for a little while). I never believed in any of the emotions the characters where trying to convince us they had (except Sutherland). And if I don't believe them, then there's no movie that I could like more better!"]
