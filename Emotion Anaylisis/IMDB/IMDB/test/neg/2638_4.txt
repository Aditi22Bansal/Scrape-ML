["Gothel uses a magical flower to remain young. The king's men discovers the flower and uses it to cure the sick pregnant queen. The queen recovers to give birth to Rapunzel with the golden hair. Rapunzel's hair turns out to have the same property as the flower. Gothel kidnaps Rapunzel raising her as her own daughter, keeping her hidden away in a tower, and using her hair to keep young. The king and queen launch lighted floating lanterns every year on the baby's birthday. As she grows into a teenager, Rapunzel pines for the outside world. Bandit Flynn Ryder is on the run from the authorities. He tries to hide in the tower, and Rapunzel hits him with a frying pan. She makes a deal to release him if he guides her to the floating lights that she sees on her birthday every year.I like the story, and I like the two lead characters. They're cute and funny together. The animation looks pretty. I just wish they have a comedic third wheel that isn't a voiceless chameleon. I wish they have a good comedian to bring some outlandish joking around. I also wish the tunes were catchier. Little kids should be singing it in the car to annoy the parents. They've got a singer in Mandy Moore, but they don't have a good song for her to sing. Nevertheless, it's pretty fun little comedy."]
