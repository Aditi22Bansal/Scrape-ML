['As Long as Corruption and the Savage Exploitation of the Weak and Virtually Helpless People are Extorted and Preyed Upon there will Exist, at Least in Fiction, The Vigilante. The Character Comes in Various Forms of Gender and Skill Set but Make No Mistake, Villains Beware. It\'s a Job that Needs to be Done and in the Real World No One Seems Willing or Able to do it. So in this Reel World there is "The Equalizer".Hollywood has Often been Called the Dream Machine and that\'s About All the Folks Can Do is Dream On. So Let the Dreaming Begin. It\'s a 60 Year Old Denzel Washington, Sporting His Aging Well, as the Titular Hero. Antoine Fuqua is the Director and the Character is Brought Back to Life from the TV Series (1985-89).The Film\'s Style is Not Ramped Up as Some of These Tend to be, but is a Slow Cooker even when it is Dispensing with a Multitude of Macho-Looking Bad Men with More Tattoos than Brains. The Movie is Not as Good as the Genre Gets but it is Passable in a Dream Time Kind of Way and the Catharsis is Present and that\'s what the Doctor Ordered, for it Seems Like that is the Only Cure for a Disease Infesting the Planet, The Evil That Men Do. Long Live the Fictional Vigilante.']
