["Bored and recently single, Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) seems to have a bad case of insomnia. SO much time spent watching the ex Suzy, ( Michelle Ryan) run through his mind. yawn. so Ben takes a job at the local market, and joins the others in passing the time in un-constructive ways. but it still goes by so slowly, that he freezes time while he's working at the store. and undresses them. and draws them. SO MANY boobs. full frontal nudity on the ladies. NOT for the young ones! nude women all over the place. it moves pretty slowly. Ben narrates the whole movie, with the other characters occasionally speaking. if we wait long enough, we'll stumble across a plot. an hour and ten minutes in, we find that Ben may date co-worker Sharon. and the store employees have hired a stripper for the manager's birthday party. where things happen, and now Sharon is mad at him. so he freezes time. but it doesn't help. can he make Sharon understand? its an age old story. this must be the plot -- trying to straighten out a misunderstanding with the girlfriend. she seems to be his muse. it's kind of like Clerks. a week in the life of. not bad. Written and directed by brit Sean Ellis, who has written and directed almost the same list of films."]
