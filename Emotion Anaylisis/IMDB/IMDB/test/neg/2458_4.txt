["Everything about this film is excessive. Even the length, but that's forgivable considering just how good, all the time, this is. From the beautiful snowy opening that manages to combine magic and menace, to the thoughtful and anguished ending, this is one hell of a ride. The violence is truly awful yet impressively awesome in its magnitude while the invasive and uncompromising scenes of sexual depravity cannot but help to convey an appalling ambiguity. As I suggest, the length would normally inhibit me but I can assure anyone similarly put off, this is that good, bad and really weird you will not object. Oh, and some way into this extraordinary film I realised that there was an ultra dark humour working here too. Just to make things that little bit harder to comfortably digest."]
