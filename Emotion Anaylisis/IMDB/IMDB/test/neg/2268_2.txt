['I was terribly disappointed after seeing this Oscar winning film for 2007. Why did this picture win the best picture Oscar? It is absolutely horrendous. The Coen brothers seem to have a very warped view of life as we saw in FARGO and O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?If I were Javier Bardem, I would have been embarrassed to accept the award for best supporting actor for playing a totally depraved killer. His voice sounded as if he were on record and was placed on slow speed. While he portrays an absolute maniac, it was just horrible to see how he goes around with his gun blasting away at his victims.The film would have been much better had it been more about the drug deal going wrong. Instead, we see 2 guys after money and we know that the latter is the root of all evil.Tommy Lee Jones becomes a philosopher in the last scene of the film. Did anyone realize that the movie ended abruptly?This is a totally awful film, way too violent for my taste and others.']
