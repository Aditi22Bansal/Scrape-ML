['Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is more of a cheap crook than anything; and will try anything for a buck. He meets a freelance Photojournalist (Bill Paxton) who tells him he tapes crime and car wrecks at night and sells the footage to local TV stations. A camcorder and police scanner later and Lou attempts getting in the news biz. What could go wrong? How shady will Lou become? At times this is disgusting, creepy with graphic scenes.Rounding out the cast: Rene Russo, Kevin Rahm, Ann Cusack, Riz Ahmed and Carolyn Gilroy.']
