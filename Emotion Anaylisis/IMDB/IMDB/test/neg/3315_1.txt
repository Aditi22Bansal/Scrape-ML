['A remake of south by a southern but just got lost from the start of the movie. The movie is having a good topic but just terribly, senselessly and horribly made. Scenes are literally enforced not to forgot the songs, which were having no timings at all.At the end of day, even Akshay Kumar can give such bad movies.']
