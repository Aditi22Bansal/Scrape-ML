["The fourth Bond film sees the criminal organisation SPECTRE trying to pull off its greatest coupÂ… to steal two nuclear weapons and hold the west to ransom. To do this one of their agents is given plastic surgery so that he looks like a NATO officer who will fly aboard an RAF Vulcan bomber. The plot probably would have worked but for the fact that Bond just happened to be undergoing some enforced relaxation at the clinic the work was done at and saw the real officer dead. The only lead is his sister Domino; she is in the Bahamas so that is Bond's destination. Here he finds her living with Largo; Bond is sure that he is involved but proving it won't be easy.This Bond film is filled with all the thrills one would expect; underwater fights, explosions, a pool full of sharks, several beautiful women and some great one-liners. The numerous undersea scenes were great particularly impressive was the final confrontation between Largo's men and the US forces summoned by Bond's CIA friend Felix Lieter. Sean Connery was once again great as Bond and Adolfo Celi was good as the villain Largo and Claudine Auger did a decent job as Domino."]
