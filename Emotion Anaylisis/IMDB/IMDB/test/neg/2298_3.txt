['"Street Fighter: Assassin\'s Fist" was allegedly supposed to be THE movie for the "Street Fighter" franchise. I can\'t claim to have had any expectations to this, given the previous movies.But this 2014 really is the icing on the cake. It was abysmal on so many levels. The storyline was just a mess, and there was no real coherency in it, and I must admit that I dozed off more than once throughout this movie, and ended up getting up and leaving, not finishing the movie.The characters in the movie were adequate, but wow it was so hard to take Ken seriously with that hair. He looked like he had a really bad wig attached to his head.The fighting was adequate, but there wasn\'t much of it. Which otherwise would have added a bit more to the movie.The Van Damme "Street Fighter" movie was at least more spoofy, so it was more enjoyable to watch because it was so out there. And the "Legend of Chun-Li" was at least a step in the right direction, but not really great.For a martial arts movie based on a video game, "Street Fighter: Assassin\'s Fist" was a snoozefest on a grand scale, and it failed to entertain me on any level. As such, I give it a mere 1 out of 10 stars.']
