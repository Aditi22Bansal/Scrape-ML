["They did a remake of the incredible story of Henri Charriere Papillon. Why? I don't know. It was clearly not as good as the first one which may have had some Hollywood dramatization. This film appeared to be more gritty and realistic but knowing the ending made it anti-climatic. Not a bad production, just not as good. Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Nudity."]
