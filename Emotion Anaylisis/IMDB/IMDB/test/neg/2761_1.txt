['Superman is not exactly a pinnacle in film history, but is a great film never-the-less. There is so much to like about this film it boggles the mind. First off, Marlon Brando playing Jor-el in the way only Brando could. Second, you got Gene Hackman as one of the major bad-asses of comic-book adaptations. Even parents (who might be reluctant to watch anything with their kids) will want to take a look-see at Brando, Hackman, and Christopher Reeve as the man of steel which many baby boomers remember to be their child hood hero. In fact, there are many who do consider this the best super-hero film ever made. Its way up there for me, as it is a well done, with some great action and good actors. A+']
