["I found Halloween 2 to be an awful movie, but I have seen worse. The directing was awful. There was no continuity for the script, and the concurrent movie stories did not intertwine well. The movie had no build up for the story just action. Even the action scenes were predictable. Does Rob know how to create characters who are other than trailer trash. Everyone uses the f word and yells. Rob needs more balance persona for his movies characters. There were a few good parts to the Halloween movie. One see's how angry and deranged Micheal is. Just nothing but anger with this guy. The other theme that big people are hard to hurt message got across well with the film. I notice silence with the Michael character creates a stronger emotion than dialogue. I give the movie a 3 out of 10."]
