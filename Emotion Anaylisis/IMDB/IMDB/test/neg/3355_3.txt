["Sandra Bullock returns as Annie Porter, who, along with her fianc√©e officer Alex Shaw(Jason Patric) are on a romantic cruise liner which is (of course) hijacked by a deranged computer programmer(Willem Dafoe) out for revenge against his company, and wants to use the SeaBourn Legend as the instrument of revenge. Can Annie and Alex stop him? Unbelievably awful film is one of the most inferior sequels ever made. Idiotic plot, poor editing and direction(Jan De Bont) and a bizarrely different portrayal of Annie that is most unappealing(What went wrong between her and Jack Traven I wonder?) Jason Patric tries, but dreadful film is a sinking ship that he can't save.A total disaster."]
