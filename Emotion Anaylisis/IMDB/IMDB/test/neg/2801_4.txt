["Truly a terrible film is this 2005 colossal stinker. At first, while viewing the film, you think it's basically a trilogy of 3 stories in a horrible urban environment.Bruce Willis, as the cop with the heart condition, appears briefly and is resurrected much later in the film.You can never recognize Mickey Rourke from his battered, broken face on screen.The violence in the film is unbelievable. Women come off as predators of the worst degree.The plot is extremely thin and basically non-existent.Certainly, more should have been spoken about with regard to the corrupt senator."]
