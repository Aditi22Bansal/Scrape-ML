['It\'s always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn\'t really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It\'s not real? Isn\'t a movie "not" real by definition? So if you really criticize something about this movie, let it be the story (or parts of it), that just don\'t work out quite as well. But as with most thrillers, the movie picks up pace, so that you don\'t have time to think about a few things, that really shouldn\'t be happening. But again, starting to pick too much on those things, why go watch the movie in the first place? I knew what I was going to get and it was more or less what I expected. I was kinda surprised to see that many nationalities on screen. Woody H. was quite funny, although not fully "used" (imo). So despite quite a few things that didn\'t work (always in the context of the movie), you can have some fun with this.']
