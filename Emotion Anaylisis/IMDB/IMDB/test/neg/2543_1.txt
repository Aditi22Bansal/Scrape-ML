["Grown Ups 2The best part of being a grown up is that you can buy alcohol for your under-age girlfriend.Thankfully, the adults in the comedy are married to fellow grown ups.Desperate to relive his childhood, Lenny (Adam Sandler) moves his wife (Salma Hayek) and children to his Connecticut hometown.Reunited with grade school buddies Eric (Kevin James), Kurt (Chris Rock) and Higgins (David Spade), Lenny plans to make this summer the most memorable.But for that to happen, the gang must endure a childhood bully (Steve Astin), rowdy frat boys (Taylor Lautner, Milo Ventimiglia), an estranged son (Alexander Ludwig) and angry wives (Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello).The unwarranted sequel to the awful original, Grown Ups 2 foregoes plot for the sake of puerile pranks perpetrated by formerly funny comedians.Besides, growing up doesn't mean you have to stop being a kid, it just means you can't be tried as one.Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"]
