["The worst akshay Kumar movie in the past few years. Screenplay was horrible. Performances of the supporting cast were awful (overacting). Akshay Kumar ad shared Kelker were the only good performances. Good topic but the execution was horrible. The casting was also really bad akshay Kumar (53) plays the son in law. Many Rishi (43) plays the brother in law. And Rajesh sharma the youngest (40) plays the fatherðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Just don't even think about watching this film and go and watch Ludo instead this Diwali."]
