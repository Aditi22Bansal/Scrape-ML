['Adam is a history professor who is shocked to see a film with an actor who looks just like him. Because of this, he tries to contact the guy...only to have the man\'s wife think Adam IS Anthony. So, apparently they not only look identical but they sound identical as well. Where does this go next? Well, I guarantee 100% you won\'t guess if you\'ve never seen the story!!To me, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most unusual and interesting actors today. So often he picks strange non-mainstream projects that are incredibly good, such as "Donnie Darko", "Source Code", "Night Crawler" and "Prisoners". Because of this, I often seek out his films as I know they will be treats.Unfortunately, while "Enemy" is certainly unusual, and that is a plus, the film itself didn\'t work all that well for me. This is because the film lacked energy and instead of action and excitement, the film nearly put me to sleep. Even worse, the music really helped lull me to semi-consciousness!']
