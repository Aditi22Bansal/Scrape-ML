['While I didn\'t try to think of the song, the line "Baby don\'t hurt me ... don\'t hurt me no more" came to mind. And it\'s not like it doesn\'t suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let\'s get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn\'t or don\'t already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you\'ll see everything of them in this. It\'s not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It\'s about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can\'t have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their "world" view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...']
