["Teenage boy Mike (a credible and likeable performance by Michael Baldwin) suspects that the weird tall man mortician (a splendidly sinister turn by Angus Scrimm) at a mysterious funeral home is up to no good, but can't convince his older brother Jody (an engaging portrayal by Bill Thornbury) that something is amiss.Writer/director Don Coscarelli not only does a masterful job of creating and sustaining a supremely surreal'n'spooky gloom-doom atmosphere, but also cleverly blends elements of horror (the infamous silver sphere in particular is a startling sight to behold in action!), humor, and science fiction into an extremely unique, surprising, and hugely enjoyable whole. Moreover, Coscarelli also offers a rich exploration of basic adolescent fears and hang-ups pertaining to death, loss, sex, and fear of abandonment that gives this film a substantial amount of additional depth and resonance.Most importantly, the protagonists register well as sympathetic everyday folks who find themselves caught up in an otherworldly situation that's way beyond their ability to initially understand or effectively cope with. Reggie Banister lends sturdy support as easygoing ice cream man Reggie while Kathy Lester makes a favorable impression as the lovely (and lethal) Lady in Lavender. The spot-on creepy score by Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave further enhances the overall eerie mood. Totally deserving of its stellar cult classic status."]
