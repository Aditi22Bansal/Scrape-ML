["I never quite understood why the old pirates got so ticked off at the town. It was through their own bumbling that everything happened. Then, of course, we have the old legend and the festival and people who can't see their hands in front of them (fog joke). Of course, most of us wake up every morning thinking that the pea soup stuff we see occasionally has as its consequence making the drive to work uncomfortable, even dangerous. We don't know that eye patch and peg leg are in there working their many charms. I don't mean to be harsh, but a good ghost story needs proper exposition to provide us with a palpable threat. The foundation is hokum and it just didn't work for me."]
