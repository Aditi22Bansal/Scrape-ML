["It's 1943. 2000 British troops are trapped on the island of Keros in the Aegean Sea. The Nazis are about to launch a massive assault in six days. Any escape is blocked by two massive guns on the island of Navarone. Air attacks has been useless. The Allies send in mountaineer Captain Keith Mallory (Gregory Peck), defeated Greek Colonel Andrea Stavrou (Anthony Quinn), explosive expert Corporal Miller (David Niven), former Navaronite Greek-American Spyros Pappadimos (James Darren), and knife fighter/engineer Butcher Brown (Stanley Baker). They are led by Major Roy Franklin (Anthony Quayle). They have to take out the guns before 6 British destroyers make a run for Keros.The action is good but a bit old fashion. The action at sea in the storm does get a little confusing. It's not as exciting as I want. The cliff climbing is also very fake with obvious painting and interior sets. Even the shooting and battles are very static. The cameras don't seem to move. I also wish they stop throwing dummies over a big drop. It's obvious that those are mannequins. At least, they are putting a lot of men and equipment on the screen in some of the filler scenes. As for the story, it gets a little gritty for its time while it's also slow in some stretches. The actors are generally too old for the roles. However that gives the movie a world-weary feel. It's good because they are even more of an underdog group."]
