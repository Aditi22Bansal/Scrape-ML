['"Halloween II" starts up where Rob Zombie\'s "Halloween" ended. Laurie Strode and Dr.Loomis killed Michael in the finale.Laurie is in hospital recovering from her wounds.Michael\'s body is on the way to the hospital too,transported by medical staff,but our beloved serial killer ain\'t dead.He promptly starts slaughtering his victims.He also has a visions of his dead mother accompanied by a white horse.The evolution of Dr.Loomis(Malcom McDowell)is laughable.He is just a money-hungry celebrity,who doesn\'t want to protect the world from Michael."Halloween II" looks dirty and grimy with many scenes shot at night.There are some extremely gory murder scenes,the action is fast and the suspense is completely absent.In "Halloween II" Zombie did indeed make the film his own and in doing so completely destroyed the mythology of Loomis and the character that so many true "Halloween" fans admired.4 out of 10.']
