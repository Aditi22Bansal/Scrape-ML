['During the summer of 1979, a group of friends witness a train crash and investigate subsequent unexplained events in their small town.I do love the inclusion of the Walkman, the Soviets and other period things, especially the music. While I did not live in 1979, I appreciate period pieces of the 70s and 80s (Ti West\'s Satanic Panic film nailed this.) I also like that at times, the film has the sensibility of "Goonies". I wish the whole film did, because these were the stronger scenes. The monster part was less interesting, actually ,than the childhood adventures.Roger Ebert summed it nicely when he wrote, "Super 8 is a wonderful film, nostalgia not for a time but for a style of film-making, when shell-shocked young audiences were told a story and not pounded over the head with aggressive action. Abrams treats early adolescence with tenderness and affection."']
