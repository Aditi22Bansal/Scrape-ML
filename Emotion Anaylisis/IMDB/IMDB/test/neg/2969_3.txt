["With the success of A Fistful Of Dollars you knew a sequel had to be made and\nClint Eastwood left the small screen for good as Rawhide concluded its run and\nhe was back in Europe for another pasta western with Sergio Leone. Making\nthe trip with Eastwood was Lee Van Cleef and the two play a pair of bounty\nhunters after the outlaw Gian Maria Volante and his gang of cutthroats. The\nusual amount of bloody mayhem was dished out by Eastwood, Van Cleef and\nthe gang itself.The treat in this film is watching Eastwood and Van Cleef taking each other's measure and circling around each other like a pair of jungle cats\nwaiting to pounce on each other. It's one uneasy partnership.If you liked A Fistful Of Dollars you will most certainly like For A Few Dollars\nMore. This one solidified Clint Eastwood as a box office draw. As for Van Cleef he got out of supporting ranks and played if not out and out bad guys,\ncertainly rather sardonic good guys for the most part in the rest of his career.Another heaping helping of pasta."]
