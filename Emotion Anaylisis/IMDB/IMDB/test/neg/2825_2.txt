["An impeccably-made slice of Cold War satire, Kubrick's well-remembered black comedy is a sharp and snappy affair with the kind of production values and direction to dream for. An absurdist situation gives the famed director a chance to explore all kinds of character comedy, with the knives kept sharpest for the American military. The performers on show don't put a foot wrong, although of course the real merit goes to Peter Sellers who convinces in no less than three widely different performances. There are some wonderful lines and situations on show here that you'll remember for the rest of your life."]
