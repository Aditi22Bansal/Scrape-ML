["Marcus Nispel directed the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, so why shouldn't he get a shot at Jason? This film is more than just a remake of the first film. It's really a bit of the first four all in one.We watch Jason as he watches his mother get killed by a camp counselor. Thirty years later, he kills every single teen who has comes to Crystal Lake looking for marijuana, except for Whitney, who reminds him of his mother.Weeks later, some rich kids come to stay at a fancy cabin. They're all fooder, too. Only Clay, Whitney's brother, can save her. Finally, Whitney acts like Jason's mother and stabs him, but he comes back at the end, rising from the lake.This is a slick, CGI animated take on the Jason mythos. I'm more into the Savini school of gore, so there's a lot of this that didn't work for me. It's not a horrible film by any means. But it's not the best of the series. And while it did well at the box office, it was also the end of the series."]
