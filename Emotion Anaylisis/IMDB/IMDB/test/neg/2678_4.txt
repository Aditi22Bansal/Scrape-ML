["A musical score and song generally can make or break a film. Such is the case for From Russia With Love. This 1963 film has a haunting theme which can never be forgotten.Sean Connery, always fabulous as the sexy James Bond, is at it again. He is just masterful in the role of the darling British Agent up to his neck in intrigue and usual suspense.Acting kudos must go to veteran actress Lotte Lenya, widow of legend Kurt Weill, for her performance as a major player in the evil organization of Spectre. As Rosa Klebb, Ms. Lenya was the embodiment of evil. She'd sell her soul to the highest paying devil. As wicked and ugly as they come, who can ever forget her knife in the shoe final scene climax. She takes a bullet to the chest and collapses against that wall in true Hollywood fashion."]
