['This film is about a boy who possesses a set of special skills that are thought to be lost, and he sets out on a mission to save the world."The Last Airbender" has a lot of cool special effects involving fire and water, but other aspects are no good. The moves to bend the elements look forceless and unconvincing. The acting, even by the main characters, are uniformly bad. I am the most disappointed by Dev Patel, who was brilliant in "Slumdog Millionaire". He shows no facial expression in this film, while the guy who played his brother is so much better than him in this aspect. The dialog can sometimes be strangely idiotic, as plot details are explicitly declared and repeated. Maybe it\'s a children\'s film, no plot detail is implied. Overall, "The Last Airbender" is alright for some brain off entertainment but I would not be looking forward to the sequel in excitement.']
