["Actually it's not really American actors playing all those roles, but I tried something witty with the summary line. Something witty is also what Russell is trying to do and it's not his first time. If you consider Three Kings and I (heart) Huckabees and what he has delivered the past few years you can't help but notice a director getting better by the minute (movie).It's not easy to juggle a movie about con artists, especially when it feels like it's build entirely on something that really happened (which apparently isn't the case, which makes this even more intriguing). But whatever the case and however you feel about some of the actors, this is brilliant. For one I do love Jennifer Lawrence, but the character she is playing could not be more despicable and appalling in my eyes. So while I'm still very fond of Lawrence herself, she (and Russell) actually made the impossible possible! I kind of hated her.There is a reason why there was Oscar buzz and nominations and what not. I know I myself get sometimes tired of buzz like that. But Russell is one to look out for and I for one cannot wait for his next movie. Whatever it is, it will be good ... whether I like it or not"]
