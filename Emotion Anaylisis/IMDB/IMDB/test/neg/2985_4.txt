['Jodie Foster has been one of the most renowned actresses for almost forty years, not to mention one of the most versatile. Pretty much all cinephiles know about her roles in "Taxi Driver" and "Silence of the Lambs". But one role with which you might not be familiar is the 1976 thriller "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane". Part indictment of hebephilia, part reminder that children aren\'t as immature as you might think, this is an impressive one.Obviously, a few of the scenes look inappropriate; I get the feeling that one scene in particular couldn\'t get on screen nowadays. Sometimes called a horror movie, it\'s more psychological thriller, slowly building up Foster\'s character and revealing her disturbing tendencies. And I recommend it. The protagonist\'s innocent appearance hides a manipulative, sociopathic side. Mind you, there are some parts that will shock you (and I don\'t mean anything dealing with death). Perfect movie to watch on Halloween (as I did).']
