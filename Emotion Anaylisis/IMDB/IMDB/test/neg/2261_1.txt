['While this version expands the story, which was OK in itself, the charisma of the performances just was not there. I enjoy William Hurt as a rule, but in this case his performance as Duke Leto "hurt". Alec Newman\'s Paul was overly whiny. Saska Reeves was too young as Jessica and then did not even play the role in the sequel, causing a jarring break in consistency. Admittedly some of the costumes were more entertaining in this version, but the still suits of the Fremen were totally unbelievable. One could not conceive of anyone lasting very long in them sitting by a lake much less in the middle of the desert. In the long run the original 1984 theatrical version is the better bet. Plus it had the blessing of the author as well.']
