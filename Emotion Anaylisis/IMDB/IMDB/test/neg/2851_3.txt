["If there is one thing I've learned in life that is: if it sounds to good to be true then it usually is. A big beautiful house in the country for an amazingly low price... what's the catch? Oh, it's just haunted that's all. I'd have to put Amityville Horror amongst the top scary movies. I know that I am far from an authority on scary movies (they are usually 3rd or 4th on my list of genre when renting a movie) but I have seen enough horror films to know a good one, and Amityville Horror was good. Even better is that although the movie was made in 1979, I didn't even see it until 2006 and I still liked it. I usually judge scary movies by how much it can startle me or frighten me without excessive blood and gore. Amityville Horror really gave me the feeling that the house had an ominous presence. George Brolin did an excellent job in his role, and I liked that it was never revealed what exactly was in the house."]
