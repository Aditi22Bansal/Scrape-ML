["Okay but nothing special.The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation. The only attempts at character development - the love story - felt weak, and were quite dull and tedious.This said it is entertaining enough to keep you watching. Not a must- see, but it's okay."]
