['This movie begins with a young girl named "Robin Hammond" (Tammy Bourne) venturing into an old building to join some other kids playing hide-and-seek. However, when the other children discover that she has joined them they decide to have a little fun by scaring her. This results in her accidentally falling out of the building and to her death. Scared that they might get in trouble with the police all four of them swear never to tell what happened and run back to their homes. Six years later each of them are now seniors in high school and on prom night they each receive a strange telephone call that none of them know how to interpret. And then the killings start. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that this was one of the first of the films that helped start the "slasher craze of the 80\'s" along with "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th". Yet, although it was certainly popular when it first came out, it seems to have lost its vitality since then. Even so, I liked the performance of Eddie Benton (as "Wendy Richards") along with the way the mystery of the killer was kept until the very end. In any case, I rate this movie as about average.']
