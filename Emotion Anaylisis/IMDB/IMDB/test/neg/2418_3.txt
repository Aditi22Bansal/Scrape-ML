["A failed attempt to make a dark Movie that smacks of Hollywood hokum. All the best Actors in the world cannot save this phony, artificial, and turgid study of some very serious character flaws and professional responsibility from becoming an unbelievable, shallow and failed attempt.It all comes off as superficial renderings and it's trek to the psychological and sociological implications of alcoholism, drug addiction, prostitution, and marital dysfunction are all like empty pamphlet prose and well meaning. but slapdash, TV Documentary intervention shows. The whole thing rings untrue.Nothing well directed here and the parading of recognizable name Stars in and out of the Film do nothing but draw unwanted attention. The placing of some great Classic Rock to heighten the mood and then abruptly fading out after only a few seconds is an abomination and signs of a Hack.These are only some of the irritants in this overrated dud and clearly illustrated that the Writer and Director have no grasp of the material. Adding to all this, the pathetic and pat ending, from the trial forward, is unforgivable."]
