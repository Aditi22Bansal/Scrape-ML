['This film is about Batman having to stop an evil mercenary from destroying Gotham City."The Dark Knight" have set the bar so high that it is so hard for Nolan to match it. While watching "The Dark Knight Rises", I became increasingly confused. I was then told that it has many links with the first Batman film. As I don\'t remember the plot of the first one, I became completely lost as to what was happening. Even after I understood what was happening, things are still unconvincing. For example, the ending twist makes no sense to me. Why would Miranda Tate require the help of Bane to destroy Gotham City, when she is in control of the device already? "The Dark Knight Rises" may be an entertaining film, but I could not get into the story. It is far too confusing as it tries to play the "Infernal Affairs" game, where good guys are bad but bad guys are good. It contains elements of the first Batman movie from years ago which people would have forgotten about already. The special effects are great, but the whole film is lost in a confusing and less than convincing plot.']
