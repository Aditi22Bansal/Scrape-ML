['For a movie that didn\'t make a whole lot of sense on a scientific level, I thought it was fairly entertaining. You just have to suspend disbelief at appropriate times, like when Millburn (Rafe Spall) tried to make nice with the cobra looking thingy, or when Shaw had her abdomen mechanically stapled and was good to go following her aliendectomy. I have to admit though, the whole concept of discovering where humanity got it\'s start left me in the dust; very confusing and not credible in the least. The alien/human DNA match was one of those one in a quadrillion shots that didn\'t pass muster with this viewer. I wasn\'t aware of this movie when it first came out, and ordered it up when I read it had something to do with the Alien franchise. So that\'s where my attention was focused the entire time, and wouldn\'t you know it, that didn\'t occur until the very end of the picture. In my case it was worth waiting for, because even if most of the story wasn\'t very credible, it still provided some cool special effects and those surreal scenes of David\'s (Michael Fassbender) disembodied head talking to Shaw. Almost as good as the first time it was done with Ian Holm in the role of Ash in the original "Alien". Hard to believe that film is almost forty years old as I write this.']
