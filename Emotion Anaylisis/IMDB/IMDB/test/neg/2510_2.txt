["The story as it is, did not offer me anything new. Nor was there any very clever writing, that I could spot. But it's still more than a decent effort by the makers. They chose the actors carefully and the location even more so. Sometimes the location can become a character itself and that is the case here. Even while I haven't been there myself, I can feel the weight of the town.Predictable it may be, not really having a big story or anything quite great to say either, this thriller will entertain you. If you let it that is. The flaws are there and very apparent. But I didn't feel that they were as big, as to actually driving the entertainment value of the movie down. You might feel differently of course, but try to enjoy it if you can."]
