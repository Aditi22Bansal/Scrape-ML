['Heavy-handed western about eleven young boys becoming "men" while on rigorous cattle drive. Crude and violent, it\'s probably John Wayne\'s worst movie next to "The Conqueror". Bruce Dern, as another in his stable of wild-eyed villains, overdoes it once again, and in his last scene with Wayne vilified himself for years to come. The film, poorly directed by Mark Rydell, has no western nostalgia for the past, and no soul-searching for a future. It\'s all laid out in a bland, barren fashion, without anybody to care about and children one would cross the street in order to avoid. Wayne does his usual walk-through, but kids don\'t seem to be his thing (he\'s not much of a father-figure, more like a ornery distant relative). Highly inflated, nauseatingly self-righteous and self-important.']
