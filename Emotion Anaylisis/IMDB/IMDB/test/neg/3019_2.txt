["William Shakespeare's much-beloved romantic tale--narrated by no less a grand interpreter of Shakespeare than Laurence Olivier himself!--has the two lovers of Verona (Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey) doomed by the fates and their warring families. This heavy-lidded endeavor (previously filmed in 1936 and 1954) would seem to be quite swoon-worthy at the outset, yet overall it is more proficient technically rather than emotionally, as the acting leads (teenagers themselves) are pretty but vacuous. Supporting performances from Milo O'Shea and Michael York are perhaps more memorable. The costumes and Pasquale De Santis' cinematography won the picture its only Oscars, fitting since the film is really all style. ** from ****"]
