['"Jaws" was one of the most frightening pieces of cinema ever created. It is a combination of sight, sound, and terror. It has some truly epic scenes and some absolutely memorable lines. So the producers have the gall to create a sequel that is about as bad as a movie can be. Everything that was startling and exciting in the original is lost here. There are people getting themselves into ridiculous situations because of their base stupidity. We have a helicopter attacked by a shark. If I had my way, a real great white shark should have shown up, eaten the cast, munched on the director and producer, and ended the movie with a huge burp. No script. No believable plot. No nothing.']
