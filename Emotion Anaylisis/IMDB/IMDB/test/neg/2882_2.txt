["The lives of a Texan family over the course of about 40 years. There are multiple story lines dealing with death, marriage, racism, alcoholism, etc etc all beautifully directed (try to see it on a big screen or letter-boxed) and well acted. Despite its 3 1/2 hour length, the film is never dull. Elizabeth Taylor is just great as the mother of the family; Rock Hudson is a little stiff, but has his moments; James Dean is perfect in what was to be his last role; Dennis Hopper is interesting as their son (he's so YOUNG!). This movie never seems to have gotten the recognition it deserved. Why not?Well worth seeing again and again and again..."]
