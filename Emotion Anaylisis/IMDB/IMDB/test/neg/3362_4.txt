['Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts.Who else (besides this film\'s director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game.This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?']
