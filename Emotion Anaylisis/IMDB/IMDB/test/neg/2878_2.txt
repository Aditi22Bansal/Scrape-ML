['On their way to a vacation destination, the Carter family, led by the self-assured patriarch, "Big Bob" Carter (Russ Grieve) find themselves lost in a desert wasteland. Their truck / camper disabled, they do what they must to find help. Unbeknownst to the Carters, another family is nearby... watching and waiting for dark.THE HILLS HAVE EYES is Director Wes Craven\'s savage statement about modern life. The Carter\'s are soft, civilized, and oblivious to danger. Not even Big Bob\'s background in law enforcement, nor his big gun are of much use against the terror they face. Stripped of their safety and security, they will certainly die unless they can revert back to a more primitive state. When the killing starts, it\'s sudden and violent, including sexual assault.Harrowing and shocking for its time, Craven saves the most powerful parts for last, when the remnant of the Carters are brought into a full-on, vengeful rage. So much for civilization under extreme stress. This is a brilliant commentary on what we are capable of when dire circumstances dictate.Co-stars Dee Wallace, as well as Michael Berryman in the role of his career...']
