["George (James Brolin) and Kathy Lutz (Margot Kidder) move their family into a house even though the previous family suffered a mass killing. Priest Father Delaney (Rod Steiger) believes the house is haunted. The demonic spirits are powerful, fellow priest Father Bolen (Don Stroud) tries to help but Father Ryan (Murray Hamilton) is unconvinced.Based on a true place where a guy committed a mass killing on his family claiming to be terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there. This movie came out in 1979 right in the middle of the Golden Age of horror. Halloween (78) came in the year before and Friday the 13th (80) came in the year right after. Masters of horrors like John Carpenter and Wes Craven are starting to emerge. This one just pales in comparison. They can't expect people to be afraid of flies. This is just not scary. The only good thing is that it is actually a professionally made movie. We have top acting talents. There's no complaining about that."]
