["I saw it when it came to America in 1980 and was almost banned in Boston. I had just turned 18 and was curious so I went to see it. YUCK!!!! This movie was truly sick. Castration, disembowelment, mutilation, beheadings, bestiality, necrophilia are all shoved in your face. I could care less if it's historically accurate or not...whatever it is, it's revolting! This theatre was packed when I went. During the movie many people walked out...in disgust I'm assuming. I had to leave after the two hour mark. There was a bad taste in my movie (from the movie!), my stomach was in knots and I felt like I was going to throw up. That should tell you something.The only saving grace in this is that they got some respected actors who, despite the material, give good performances The late John Gielgud is in the first 10 minutes and then killed off (a wise choice), Peter O'Toole is killed off after 40 minutes (another wise choice). Poor Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren (who admits she did it just for the money) suffer through the entire film. They give two great performances...much better than the film deserves.A total piece of garbage. Avoid at all costs!"]
