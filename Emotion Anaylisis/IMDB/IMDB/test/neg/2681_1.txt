['Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.As two magicians, one\'s mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman\'s wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show "The Nanny." Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don\'t run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening.']
