["Bad acting, slow, unbelievable story and after i watched for what seemed all day long, I saw I was only on Episode 6. Couldn't bear the thought of wasting 5 more hours of my limited lifespan so I turned it off and moved on. On the bright side, I was able to cook dinner and clean up the kitchen without missing a lick of the plot."]
