['When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge\'s intentions of driving off the native humanoid Na\'vi in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland.This film was pretty good when it was released the first time and called "Ferngully". This time, it is a thinly veiled political message with some awful animation. Iam aware of the work that went into it, but it still ends up looking like a cartoon, which is a failed endeavor."I can watch films and say how technically beautiful they are, but I\'m not impressed by any technicality," said Abbas Kiarostami. And that is exactly right. If "Avatar" is praised for its technology, and not for its direction, acting or intriguing plot, what good is it as a film?']
