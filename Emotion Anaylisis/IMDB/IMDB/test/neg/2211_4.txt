['Granted, the book in this case was not much better. This movie just did not have the best scenes from the book, it tacked on an ending that was just a bit to happy, and it was horribly miscast as when I read the book the pictures of the characters I got in no way resembled what we got here. Sometimes they get it near perfect, here they were off by a whole lot. The story is basically taken from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" with some Stephen King twists and perversions added to the mix, the book has the perversions, the movie takes all that kind of stuff out. In the end the movie is a dried husk of the book which was not particularly strong either. Jimmy Smits is awful in it, but then so is everyone else, and the fact it is a two parter and extended needlessly does not help matters out either. So all I can say is be prepared to see a lot of green light, a very toned down ending (granted I can see why they could not do the whole woman being naked at the end), and also be prepared for a very unmemorable ride. I would suggest reading the book instead, but it is not really all that worth finding either.']
