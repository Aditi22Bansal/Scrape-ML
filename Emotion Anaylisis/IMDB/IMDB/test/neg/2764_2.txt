["An airplane crew takes ill. Surely the only person capable of landing the plane is an ex-pilot afraid to fly (Robert Hays). But don't call him Shirley.With a cast that includes Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack and many others, how can you go wrong? You simply cannot. And of course by now everyone knows this is a winner -- if you have not seen it yet (you have had over thirty years, folks) you need to make this a priority.Although I am generally a fan of the Marx Brothers and Mel Brooks, there is plenty of wit in this. For every crude sexual joke, there are just as many clever puns and plays on words. A real range of humor styles that appeals to a broad audience."]
