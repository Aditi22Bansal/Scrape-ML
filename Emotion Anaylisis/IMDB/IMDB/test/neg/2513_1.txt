["At first I thought maybe this would have like a very original script. It featured James Caviezel so it couldn't be bad, right? WRONG! This is the lamest Beowulf adaptation since forever... and I have seen a few.Imagine that The 13th Warrior was an alien from space, Grendel was a monster from space, the vikings are like small snacks for aliens and in the end the vikings win.However, none of the intelligence of 13th Warrior was present, nor the ingenuity of Christopher Lambert's steam-punk film, nor the philosophy of the Grendel book were present in this one. The acting was poor, the script was ridiculous, and whatever John Hurt and Ron Perlman were doing in this movie, they didn't do it right. The monster effects and design were decent enough, all 5 minutes of them.I mean, you have an Alien like monster, you have at least three decent actors and a great story like Beowulf with its myriad adaptations and reinventions. And what do you do? A poor-man's remake of Alien 3 with James Caviezel doing his Jesus routine (getting beaten all movie, then almost rising to heaven).Bottom line: stay as far away from this. Yuck! Phooey! Phuthew!"]
