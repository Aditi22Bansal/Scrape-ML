["Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Darcy (Kate Hudson) are life long friends. Dex (Colin Egglesfield) was Rachel's college friend when Darcy budded in. Now Darcy and Dex are about to get married. But Rachel still has feelings for Dex and they sleep together.This movie has 2 problems and 1 great positive.Colin Egglesfield is a horribly bland lead. It's unbelievable that two great girls are battling over him. John Krasinski is an infinitely better lead. There are countless others that would be a vast improvement. Although Krasinski and Ashley Williams have some funny jokes.Second problem is that Rachel jumped into bed with Dex so early. It puts her in a moral deficit right off the bat. It makes rooting for her next to impossible.The one great positive is Ginnifer Goodwin. She pulls off the impossible by being such a sweetheart. I can't help but root for her no matter what. I don't think the movie people actually questioned the premise. At least, they could have given GG the moral high grounds."]
