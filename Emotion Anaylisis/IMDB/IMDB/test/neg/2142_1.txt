['The fact that is quirky, with just female leads and female writer and director, is the reason why the film is fun. If you would try to gender-swap it, you would get Batman and Robin without the one-liners. It makes little sense, though. From the beginning to start it is one action fest of ass kicking, but no characters that one can care about, no strategy, almost no story. Ewan McGregor\'s villain is weak and the classic cardboard psycho, so the tension is not really there. His henchman gets more screen time and is more interesting. The main character is Harley Quinn, with the "birds of prey" as secondary characters that only show their worth at the very end and frankly have little bearing on the story until then. But I would argue that what made the film more fun was Ella Jay Basco\'s unapologetic little pocket thief character.Bottom line: when the laws of physics are broken, men fall from a kick from a girl and girls get up and fight after being hit by a car and thrown into another. The film is guilty pleasure fun, but makes little sense overall.']
