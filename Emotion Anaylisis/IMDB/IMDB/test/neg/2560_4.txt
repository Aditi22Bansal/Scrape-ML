["Anna and Lucie (Morjana Alaoui and Mylene Jampanoi) are friends on a mission. They are out to face and destroy the demons from Lucie's childhood of abduction and unbelievable trauma. Unfortunately, the pair have unwittingly embarked on a journey into an unknown world of terror, torture, and utter despair.MARTYRS appears to be straightforward enough, especially during the first half. Then, secrets are revealed / unveiled, plunging everything into a hideous nightmare of hopelessness and agony. MARTYRS is a bleak descent that never lets up. Once its aperture begins closing, it chokes out all light. Still, the underlying idea is ingenious. The title comes into play in an unexpected and astonishing way.Is this film disturbing? Certainly, but in a different way than a movie like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Though there is extreme violence and gore, it is not gratuitous, and is arguably essential to the story.The truly unsettling aspects of MARTYRS are more psychological / pathological, mixed with a definite philosophy and even a profound spirituality. Far deeper than most horror films, this transcends the genre. The ending is the very definition of ambiguity and bitter irony.Is it grim? Oh yes, but for good reason. Anna and Lucie do not deserve their fates. They are caught up in something beyond understanding, and so are we. This is horror at its extremity. A masterpiece in blood..."]
