['Just watched the first episode which will also be my last. A tiresome piece. Pseudo-revelation monologues, brain-numbing dialogues. "Indescent proposal" written all over it, only Zellweger managed to be even worse in her "seductress" role than Redford. Her trying to play a cold role is pathetic at best. The rest is a very pale background for what looks like a badly thought-through story. Good looking female "doctor", "big pharma" trying to suppress an important invention, some personal cheesy story to "spice it all up". Meh. I have better ways to spend an hour at the TV.']
