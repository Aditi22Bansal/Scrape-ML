Instead, they run "One Shining Moment"-type music (like at the end of the March Madness Title Game) over a victims\' photo collage as soon as they can get their paws on some pictures. But this artificial Grief Porn doesn\'t change the fact that there\'s never been so much as a made-for-TV or even a direct-to-video feature film made about any previously anonymous victim of either a mass killing or a serial slayer. "The Krays," on the other hand, have had at least TWO feature films playing on the Big Screen (including current release LEGEND) to carefully detail their sordid gangster careers and all the people they killed. The nationwide Family Video chain in America has carried multiple flicks about John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Ted Bundy because that\'s just what U.S. citizens crave in the way of family entertainment. Anderson Cooper and Fox News do Americans a great disservice in making us wait five or ten years for the mass and serial killer details we have a right to learn for our own protection. Someone\'s going to make a killing when they give Americans the All-Crime, All-the-Time channel they so desperately need and crave!']
