["I really shouldn't review since I only watched about 45 min but , Michael Shannon. Good god! I turned it off because of him! His accent was horrific. He was all Israelis , Israelis but sounded like Idk maybe a bad German, British accent. I couldn't take him anymore. He ruined it for me because I couldn't focus on anything because of him. It was slow and I didn't give it much of a go but get an actual non American . Since it was no problem with other characters I don't know why the cast Shannon and now I'll never know of this was a decent series...."]
