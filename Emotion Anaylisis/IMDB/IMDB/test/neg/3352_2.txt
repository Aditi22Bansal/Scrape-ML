["Toronto Maple Leafs star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) has fallen into a funk after his wife Prudence left him for L.A. Kings goalie Jacques 'Le Coq' Grand√© (Justin Timberlake). Team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) hires Guru Pitka (Mike Myers) for $2 million to fix Roanoke. Pitka wants to be the next Deepak Chopra. He doesn't get along with the diminutive coach Punch Cherkov (Verne Troyer).Mike Myers makes a mistake right from the start by putting this as a Toronto Maple Leafs story. On top of that, Guru Pitka is a bad SNL skit. If Myers had tried this on SNL, he would have realized its inherent problems and abandoned the idea. It is borderline racist and worst of all, it's not funny. The only funny bits happen with Troyer if I stretch to be kind. Alba and Malco are terribly bland. Guru Pitka could be a funny character if he's an innocent and naive to the modern world. He's not likable and the comedy is repetitive."]
