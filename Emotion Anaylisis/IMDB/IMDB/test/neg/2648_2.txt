['Well, everybody knows that "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is probably the ultimate cult classic; at this point, "RHPS" isn\'t even really a cult movie anymore, due to its prominence. The plot (or whatever it is) of course has Janet Weiss (Susan Sarandon) and Brad Majors (Barry Bostwick) going to a castle run by the bizarre Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), a "transvestite from transsexual Transylvania". Mostly, the movie seems like a big excuse to be weird, and they do just that to great effect. And who ever would have guessed that Susan Sarandon, now known for serious roles, could do such a cool job singing? So, was "RHPS" trying to tell us anything? Who cares? It\'s just so neat that you just have to sit back and enjoy. And enjoy you will, even if you think that nothing good came out of the \'70s (I, for one, don\'t hold that opinion).']
