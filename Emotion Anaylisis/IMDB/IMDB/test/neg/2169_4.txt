['We are constantly being reminded that we can\'t understand movies if we are not into cgi (computer generated images). Well, that doesn\'t work for me. That\'s like saying a black light Elvis picture is true art because I don\'t appreciate black felt. Movies are good because they have a story to tell, not because they are endless eye candy. The convoluted nature of this film, taking every random horror element possible, just doesn\'t work. This is too bad. I think Hugh Jackman is a really charismatic actor. It\'s just that they throw so much against the wall to see what sticks. Maybe if, like video games, the movie came with a manual, explaining the rules that each character can play by, it would be helpful. Some can die; oops, I guess they can\'t. Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi\'s Dracula and tell him off. "There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing!" Dracula says. Maybe this movie is one of them.']
