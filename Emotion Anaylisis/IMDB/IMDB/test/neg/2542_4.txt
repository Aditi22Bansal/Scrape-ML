["I should have known when this movie started with a deer peeing into a guy's mouth that Grown-Ups 2 was setting a pretty low bar for comedy. At least the first movie had some sort of story. This sequel just throws a bunch of loosely related gags onto the screen and doesn't care if it makes any sense or if they're actually funny. It's insulting that they thought audiences would enjoy this half-baked cash grab."]
