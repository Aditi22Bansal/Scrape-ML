['I can\'t say the hype for this movie came anywhere close to matching what it turned out to be - a very amateurish and, for the first two-thirds - boring film. I mean, let\'s me honest about this. The last 20 minutes is wild, no doubt, and fun to watch, even with super-primitive special-effects, but it doesn\'t make up for the root-canal-painfully slow and inane first 65 minutes.A bunch of high school girls wind up at "Auntie\'s house" for the night. En route, we get an hour of giggles and each one calling each other "Gorgeous," "Fantasy," "Professor," "Melody," "Kung Fu" and other assorted corny names. The fun doesn\'t really start until the last part when all hell breaks loose and the girls start fighting for their lives as the goofy house, led by the big white cat and the "lonely" evil aunt, seem to want to kill them all. That\'s after one or two of the girls had disappeared.Maybe 30 years ago, the FX looked cool, but they are so bad now if almost laughable.....so my advice to to rent the film and keep your expectations low, grind your way through the first hour and then you\'ll be sufficiently entertained at the end.Just because the overpriced Criterion line put this out, it doesn\'t mean it is some arty "masterpiece." It is anything but that.']
