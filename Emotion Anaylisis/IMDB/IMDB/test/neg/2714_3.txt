["Fantastic Voyage boasted great special effects for its day. It also is a neat fantasy thriller being a race against the clock with a saboteur on board.Agent Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd) has been bought in fo a secret mission. Jan Benes is a scientist who has been injured while escaping from Russia. He has a blood clot on the brain.In order to save Benes life. American scientists will miniaturize a nuclear submarine, inject it into Benes' body and fix the clot. They have 60 minutes to do this before the submarine returns to its normal size.Grant is warned that the surgeon Dr Duval might also be an assassin. Once they get inside the body, it is a bumpy ride and nothing seems to go according to plan.Director Richard Fleischer manages to stay on the right side of camp. The film takes a while to get going but once inside the body, it is a nicely crafted and well paced movie with lots of suspense.Raquel Welch is suitable eye candy. The special effects as the submarine goes through the bloodstream has a psychedelic touch. It is just a shame that the villain is a little too obvious."]
