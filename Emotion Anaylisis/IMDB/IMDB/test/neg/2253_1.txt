['Being a person who\'s heard of Halo, but knows nothing about it - this was the movie to watch!! Or, so I thought. It\'s a miniseries, which allows for all kinds of back-story and exposition. Instead they spend all the time on brief character development in a recruit center. They come under attack, but since the Halo story hasn\'t been explained, it\'s just another sci-fi story. One of the core parts of Halo, so I\'m told, are the Spartan\'s. These are shown in bad pirated video, and not explained. When the action starts, it\'s pretty wild, but again I really didn\'t know what was going on. Summary: For a Halo fan it\'s too much about the recruits, and not enough action. For the newbie like me, it was too little background. So, it fails for both potential audiences. Good flick though, for a generic sci-fi. Bad flick for a signature presentation of a iconic name like Halo.Follow-up Note: If you can watch "Halo Legends" (2010) before this movie, then it will make sense. It fit\'s in rather nicely as a side story in the larger story.']
