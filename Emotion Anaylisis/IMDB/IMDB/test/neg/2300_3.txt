["THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) *** Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, Brian White, Amy Acker, (Cameo: Sigourney Weaver) The eponymous genre flick gets itself turned inside out in this at times too-cool-for-its-own-school underpinnings from filmmakers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard : five stereotypical young adults venture into the secluded topiary where upon visiting the abandoned edifice .well let's just say things start to happen and then thingsreallystartto..HAPPEN! While the clever premise gets giddy in its final act where the collective horror ya-yas are set loose (literally) there is little terror and more in the line of show-me-how-you-can-top-THIS ethos, the expectations high eventually plateaus but those-in-the-know fanboys/girls will eat this up begging for more. Kudos to Kranz as the clear-eyed stoner getting in touch with his inner Shaggy in this long-form SCOOBY-DOO meets THE EVIL DEAD by way of a cosmic Rubik's cube plotting."]
