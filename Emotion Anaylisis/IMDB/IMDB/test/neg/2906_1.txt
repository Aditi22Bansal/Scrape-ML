['Jean-Luc Godard\'s New Wave romantic-drama, credited with starting a newly-raw and exciting cycle in French cinema, is thrilling solely as a visceral experience--but don\'t look for substance. Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a thief on the run from police. He finds security with his moody American girlfriend played by Jean Seberg, looking lovely in a pixie haircut though seeming just a bit out of her element here. Raoul Coutard\'s crisp black-and-white cinematography provides atmosphere-atmosphere-atmosphere--and the movie looks good enough to eat--and yet it isn\'t much of a meal, only dessert. Godard isn\'t interested in a logical narrative; chasing after style, he did manage to break fresh ground with "Breathless" in 1960, and the charisma can still felt today. **1/2 from ****']
