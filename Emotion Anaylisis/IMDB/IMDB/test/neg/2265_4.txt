["This film was a 4 hour film. I watched it hoping it had a better ending then the previous 3 hours and 58 minutes. I thought the plot of the story was so fragmented. To many so called good men going bad. Same scenario, lust for some other man's wife or girlfriend. There were really no heroes,no one that had honor and nothing to come away with but a lot of fighting. There seemed to be no good against evil like Lord of the Rings. It was evil against the lesser evil. Lord of the Rings had fantasy, fighting, ugly characters orcs etc. Lord of the Rings had soldiers that were courageous, loyal, honorable, fearful, faithful,love and more. Lord of the Rings had meaning. it had good against evil and the good people always resisting even when they were scared and knew that little chance to win. Merlin had people that could not be trusted even valiant names known in other medieval stories. Merlin wasn't a good magician either, so much for magic I guess. This movie also mentions Christians and makes them out to be just as bad as the evil people. The acting wasn't bad but like Mab the evil woman it is time to forget her and it."]
