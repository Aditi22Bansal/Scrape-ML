["Sticking closer to the time of Bram Stoker's novel, Horror Of Dracula was the\nsecond of many joint appearances of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. With\nfangs baring and a look of menace permanently on his countenance, Christopher\nLee became the new face of Dracula only two years after Bela Lugosi died. He\nbecame the new face of Dracula and unlike Lugosi who only made two appearances as the Count, Lee did quite a few more Dracula films.His Dr. Von Helsing is Peter Cushing also getting started in his career in horror\nfilms. These two were the mainstays of Hammer films and with their release\nin America became as known in America as they were in the United Kingdom.Also in the cast is Michael Gough who did a few horror flicks himself as a man\nwho loses a sister and her fiance to the evil blood drinking undead count and\nnearly loses another sister.The film is quite a bit more gory than the Lugosi classic which relied more on\nthe Gothic sets created at Universal Studios. Dracula deals in blood and that's\nwhat the movie going public got here and plenty of it.After 60 years and after 40 years when Hammer films went out of business,\nHorror Of Dracula hasn't lost a bit of bite."]
