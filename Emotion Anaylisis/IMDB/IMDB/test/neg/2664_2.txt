["Disconcertingly glum 007 entry with George Lazenby attempting to fill Sean Connery's shoes as the super-smooth secret agent (this was his only James Bond outing). Bond falls in love with a troubled Contessa while tracking nemesis Blofeld (Telly Savalas) from the Swiss Alps. The action sequences are nicely spread about by director Peter R. Hunt, whose work unfortunately goes slack for the romantic drama. One simply fails to believe James Bond in this affair of the heart--and when he chats with old friend Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), it seems absurd that she should treat him just as she always has (maybe it's the job and not the man she's secretly smitten with?). Certainly there are unusual ingredients here for a 007 adventure, but it doesn't quite click. Terrific music score by John Barry, fine cinematography and amazing stunt work. As for Lazeneby: he's down-to-earth and handsome enough, but bland. ** from ***"]
