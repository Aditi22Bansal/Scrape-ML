["Baby is a young man (Ansel Elgort) who is tantamount to a stunt car driver, though he's not a pro. He works for a criminal (Kevin Spacey) as a wheelman after robberies as a way to pay him back for stealing from him some years earlier. He hides the money he makes in the floorboards of the apartment he shares with his foster father (C.J. Jones), who is deaf and in a wheelchair. The two sign to one another. That's good, because Baby doesn't talk much. He spends all tie listening to music via his earbuds - he has tinnitus from a childhood accident that killed his parents.Baby meets a waitress, Debora (Lily James) and falls for her - she doesn't know what he does. And the latest robbery involves some violent and very nasty characters (John Bernthal, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Elza Gonzalez). And that puts Baby, Joseph, and Debora in danger.Really excellent film with unbelievable car chases. Elgort has great moves as he dances around listening to his tunes. He underplays, but his feelings read in his face. The rest of the acting is excellent; Spacey and his gang are mean as dirt. Highly recommended."]
