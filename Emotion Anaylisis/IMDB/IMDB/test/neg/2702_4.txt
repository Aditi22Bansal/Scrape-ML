['James Bond (Sean Connery) heads to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by SPECTRE agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme.Of all the James Bond films, this one has one of the less-notable Bond girls. After passing on Julie Christie and Raquel Welch, we end up with Claudine Auger as Dominique "Domino" Derval. The character of Domino is interesting, but Auger is hardly well known. (Though fans of Italian horror may recognize her for Mario Bava\'s "Twitch of the Death Nerve".) Sean Connery is the definitive Bond, and this film shows us why. He is smooth and chats up the ladies in ways that no other Bond has. Sorry, Roger Moore. But it is the case.']
