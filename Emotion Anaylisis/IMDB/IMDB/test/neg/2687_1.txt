['it could be the best motif to see Grease. a so familiar song is the right invitation to discover a legendary musical. the second - Sandy and Danny couple. who remains inspired image of the high school love story. but Grease is more than a nice film. or, only, a legendary one. it is example of smart story, wise use of clich√©s and admirable music. and this is the start point. for see one of the most fresh films. because it preserves the spirit of a period. and reflects the feelings of an unique age. because it is a film about vulnerability, courage, entertainment and joy. a story. who seems be perfect.']
