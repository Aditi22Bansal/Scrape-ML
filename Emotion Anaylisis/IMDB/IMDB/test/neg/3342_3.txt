['. . . Japan\'s current Deplorable Trojan Horse from its official government Sony propaganda arm brags about casting our beloved STAR TREK and X-MEN icon, Sir Patrick Stewart, as "Poop." Sony\'s sneak attackers depict Sir Patrick as a literal Multi-Twisted Dung Pile, and portray America\'s school children as pampered little weasels being allowed to obsess over symbols on their cell phones to the exclusion of anything else during lesson hours in their classrooms. (While America\'s so-called "Public" schools strove mightily under B.H. Obama to Realize this Made-in-Japan Nightmare, Leader Trump recently elevated the Little Lady who virtually replaced Detroit\'s failing and locally-mismanaged schools with her National Chain of FOR PROFIT Charter Academies to implement her No Cell Phones, No Nonsense Policies nationwide.) Thus THE EMOJI MOVIE pits Leader Trump and Betsy DeVos against the already-nuked-twice Japan, and that failed nation-state\'s steady stream of sordid Sony cinema sewage scum. Once to every man and nation comes this moment to decide between Satan Sony or Leader Trump\'s side: Please Tweet the latter ASAP about YOUR support for nuking each and every Sony Smut Studio!!']
