['What were they thinking of when they made this movie? John Travolta acted like he was in a broadway play(the way he spoke and acted mainly), the characters had horrible interactions, the so called alien species, whom John Travolta plays look like humans with tubes and dreadlocks, and the special effects and plot was incredibly stupid. My last words after renting this from the movie store were, "I demand a refund!"']
