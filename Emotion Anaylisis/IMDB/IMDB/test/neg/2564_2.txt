["Though the satire is heavy handed at times, there is still enough to get some really good laughs from Tropic Thunder, Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux's salute to blood and guts war films.I think Stiller and Theroux got their idea for this film from The Three Amigos. If you'll remember three Hollywood silent western stars are transported to Mexico which if you'll remember was in one anarchic state during the teen years of the last century. What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups. What to do is set them down in total isolation in the jungle with cameras and explosive devices.Unfortunately that part of the jungle is now the turf of some nasty drug dealers who are intrepid actors have to do some real battle with. Especially after they capture one of them, Ben Stiller, and the ransom they demand from the producers ain't forthcoming.The best gag in the film is Tom Cruise and the hilarious portrayal he gives in an unbilled role. I can't say more because that is the whole point of the joke. Tropic Thunder could have stood some improvement, but I laughed pretty good in the theater. The film is also politically incorrect as all get out as you will discover in Robert Downey, Jr.'s part."]
