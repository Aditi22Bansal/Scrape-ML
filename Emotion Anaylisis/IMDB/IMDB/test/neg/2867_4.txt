["Director Philip Kaufman's remake/follow-up to the 1958 suspense classic is unnerving and unsettling...but also unsatisfying. Alien pods are replacing human beings with robot-like replicants, and Kaufman does a great job at setting the scene: following believably eccentric San Franciscans through the city as mysterious flowers begin popping up all over the place! Curly-headed Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams are very companionable co-stars here, and Kaufman's energy-level starts high, but the film seems to get weighed down with its own minutiae. W.D. Richter's screenplay is hectic and muddled, and the picture scrambles around for an ending. Kaufman is vigilant that his version of this story will not conclude happily (as the studio-mandated original did); that's fine, but his conception, while at times admirable, is also dispiriting--and ugly instead of scary. **1/2 from ****"]
