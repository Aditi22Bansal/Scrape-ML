["One thing this movie about college level a capella singing competition demonstrates is that the actresses involved are multi talented from the control freak played by Anna Camp to the lovely Brittany Snow and of course Anna Kendrick. They can sing dance whatever. But Anna Kendrick as a the lead wasn't quite right. She is better in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick's face can't express different types of emotion, eg anger sadness happiness - it's all the same showing a bit of teeth like a beaver. The girls are the stars here. The leading boys are rather dorky and forgettable. Breakout comedic star Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy provides comic relief.The writing isn't that good some scenes could have been funnier. But at least it isn't as hyper and freakish as Glee. Some rather surprising negative stereotypes shown but overall it's quite a feel good pleasant movie."]
