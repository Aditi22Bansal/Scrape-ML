["Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) broke up with Jack. Relationships based on extreme circumstances rarely ever work. She's been dating a nice simple safe beach patrol cop Alex Shaw (Jason Patric) for the last 2 months. She runs into him taking a bad guy as a part of the SWAT team. He convinces her to go on a cruise to work out their relationship. John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) is a disgruntle employee who uses his computer skills and inside knowledge to hijack the ship sending it into danger. He forces the passengers to abandon ship. Not everybody gets out as deaf girl Drew is trapped in the elevator. Alex decides to stay behind when he suspects foul play.It's really bad that Jack doesn't return. It's like a Die Hard movie without John McClane. Honestly, if they can't get Keanu Reeves back, I rather have Sandra Bullock save the day by herself. The movie never recovers from it. The first Speed is a manufactured plot but the writing is so good that it never felt fake. This is the exact opposite. Every move in the story feels fake. The first one pulls the audience right in. This one never does. The final boat crash has tons of destruction but it's played almost exclusively for laughs. It feels more like a spoof. It's fun as light weight action goes but I stop caring about the movie long before that."]
