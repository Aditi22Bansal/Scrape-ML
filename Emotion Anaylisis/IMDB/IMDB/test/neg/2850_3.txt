["Newlyweds (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into a house where a murder was committed, and experience strange manifestations which drive them away.This is easily the most successful film ever connected with American International and Sam Arkoff. Even their Corman days cannot compare to how huge this was, just judging by the sequels -- without even counting the box office receipts. Whoever picked up and produced this title was brilliant. Whatever effect the book had on people, the film did one hundredfold -- who does not have that house's image burned in their brain, even if they never even saw the movie? I do like that there is not much focus on the kids. The remake tends to give the daughter more screen time, while here it is more like a subplot. A child-focused haunting film is different than an adult-focused haunting films, and I think it really comes out in this one.The Blu-Ray from Scream Factory is amazing and a must-own. Besides the improved picture and sound, there is a twenty-minute documentary with Brolin and Kidder that really hits hard behind the scenes -- from the Lutz family, to the ghost pig, they cover everything."]
