['When "Network" first came out, it probably seemed like a warning of what could happen. Now, in the age of infotainment-mergers-etc, it\'s amazing how accurate they were. Actually, "Network" isn\'t really about mergers as much as TV stations getting taken over by organizations that have nothing to do with news (sound familiar, people?). When anchorman Howard Beale\'s (Peter Finch in an posthumous Oscar-winning role) ratings drop, the network fires him, and he flips on air. So, the network decides to exploit this. And exploit it they do. Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway in an Oscar-winning role) is the epitome of the bitchy, business-obsessed executive woman; she talks about business even when having sex. All in all, it\'s impressive how real this movie looks today.']
