['"Sleeping Beauty" is a well-known classic fairytale by the Brothers Grimm perpetuated through several generations. "Maleficent" rewrites the tale but is not a bad movie; on the contrary, has a good story, screenplay, performances and special effects. Unfortunately it shows the present absence of new ideas from the writers that need to destroy or remake what does exist and is excellent. When it is a classic like "Sleeping Beauty", the procedure is very sad for those that have spent their lives worshiping the wonderful fairytale. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Mal√©vola" ("Maleficent")']
