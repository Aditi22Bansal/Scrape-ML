['Disappointingly unfunny early Murray vehicle has him at an outdoors camp with young women, etc. Bring on the filthy jokes!I saw this years ago, on public television, and I don\'t remember very much about it. I do remember that I found it disappointing and quite dry, without many laughs at all and Murray--fresh off "SNL"--had not yet perfected the dry comedy in a mainstream movie that he would show much better in "Stripes" (1981) under the guidance of Ivan Reitman. Here, it\'s just not very funny.2/5 stars.John Ulmer']
