['Rob Zombie at the helm, writing, directing and co-producing this follow-up to his 2007 HALLOWEEN. The story isn\'t much compared to the original franchise; but it is brutally violent and grisly. Special effects are first rate for being gruesome. This film just seems to be a lumbering mess. Zombie\'s wife Sheri Moon Zombie reprises her role as Deborah Myers. Its that time again to "trick-or-treat" in Haddonfield, Illinois, where psycho Michael Myers(Tyler Maine) left unexplained carnage. Mean Mike breaks out of the institution, not before he leaves a bloody mess. He has urgent needs to return home to finish up on some family business. His sister(Ms. Zombie) is still there as well as his surviving victim Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton). To capitalize on the infamous holiday, Michael\'s doctor Samuel Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is in town to plug his new book. As expected Halloween will once again be bloody.I\'m not real fond of the White Horse aspect nor the visions of little Michael and his mother; they could have been left out entirely. Plus the F word was way over-used. And the actress playing Laurie is so bad and irritating, you could care less how long she survived. Also starring are: Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, with smaller roles for Margot Kidder, Howard Hesseman and Bill Fagerbakke.']
