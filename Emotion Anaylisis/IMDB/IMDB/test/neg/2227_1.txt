['I have to say, I found this to be a huge disappointment. I thought the first act was great but after that I just lost more and more interest in it. I want to do this in a few bullet points. What was up with Adele\'s sexuality? I thought the first act made it obvious that she\'s actually a lesbian and, although she\'s tried to make it work with males, she\'s just not able to (as evidenced by the events with the super hot guy in the beginning... If you don\'t want him, I\'ll take him Adele!). I thought this was very firmly established, so then why is she supposedly hooking up with a guy later on because she feels "lonely"? I thought being with men didn\'t fulfill anything in her? But she\'s with a man later on because she feels lonely? I wouldn\'t have a problem with this had the first act not contradicted this. Am I missing something? Maybe someone can clarify it...']
