['Get past the hype; and you still have an intense piece of Sci-Fi from Director Michael Bay. Great F/X and sound. The Earth is the chosen battleground for two races of intergalactic robots, the Autobots and the Decepticons...the battle is for the possession of a cube shaped talisman, hided somewhere on Earth. These metal aliens are able to change into various objects like cars, trucks, boom boxes, aircraft and such..and supposedly these visitors have been among us for quite some time. The spoils of victory is the survival of mankind and the chance for the enormous mechanical victors to return home...the planet Cybertron. This big budget blockbuster stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel and Bernie Mac. Another Spielberg success.']
