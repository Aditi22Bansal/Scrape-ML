['Small town Texas lives in 1951: the teenage girls are busy thinking about boys and marriage, while their boyfriends take sex in stride. All the while, time is ticking away on their adolescence, and turning their community into a shadow of its former self. "The Last Picture Show" was only Peter Bogdanovich\'s second directorial achievement, which won critical raves so filled with exaltation that it immediately put the noses of his competitors and counterparts out of joint (Bogdanovich was nominated for a Best Director Oscar, but lost). This adaptation of Larry McMurtry\'s novel, by McMurtry and Bogdanovich, is an unblushing look at randy, impatient young people and their elders, most of whom are living in the past. It has a somewhat cynical eye (often for a comedic affect), but also an intimate spirit and a dazzle that sweeps the audience up. You can\'t help but be moved by it, with those rich, warm echoes of Hank Williams songs on the radio and screen-doors squawking in the dusty wind. It\'s a touchstone movie, and has stood the test of time. Superlative performances by an amazing cast; Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson won well-deserved Supporting Oscars. Bogdanovich revisited these lives in 1990 with "Texasville". ***1/2 from ****']
