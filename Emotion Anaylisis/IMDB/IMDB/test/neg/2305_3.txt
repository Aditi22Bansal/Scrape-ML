["I'm a bit dissapointed: couldn't they get Mila Kunis too to complete the holy trinity? You know, Rachel Bilson, Kristen Stewart and her ... everyone is calling them that, right? No? Ok kidding aside and back to the movie though (especially because Kristen does not really have a big part here ... not that Rachel Bilson is doing much either, just saying): this is a light and entertaining affair if you suspend your disbelief with more than a stellar cast.If you can get Samuel L. Jackson to play any part in your movie ... I'd say you are good. Doug Liman directing also helps a lot. So while I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece and full of cliches and odd character traits and choices ... you can put all those aside and just enjoy the movie ... it is possible! Just do it - otherwise it is probably better not to watch the movie at all (effects have aged quite good by the way all things considering)"]
