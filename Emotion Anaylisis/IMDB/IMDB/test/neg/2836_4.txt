["George Taylor (Charlton Heston), John Landon, Stewart and Dodge are astronauts on a near light speed spacecraft. After around 18 months in hibernation, they crash land on an unfamiliar planet. The year outside is 3978 AD around 2000 years after launch. Stewart is dead. The three survivors escape the sinking craft with almost no supplies. Primitive humanoids with no language steal their supplies and clothing. They are also raiding a corn field. Then they are set upon by a hunting party of apes.The apes don't show up until 35 minutes. When they do show up on horseback, it becomes movie history. The story is compelling to the bitter end. Charlton Heston has his John Wayne swagger. He is the big American iconic superior man. Sci-fi had an interesting run in the 60s and this is definitely part of it. Then there is the ape makeup. That's the biggest danger of this movie. It could have gone terribly wrong. However for its time, the makeup is done very well. The mouth moves a little. The main ape characters can show some emotions. This is a well made sci-fi icon."]
