["Right at the start of the movie, there is a disclaimer. What we see is not something that would ever happen. It says a lot about the state of mind people were in back then. Though if you consider how fast peope are in believing stuff on social media right now, you wouldn't have guessed that we evolved ... I reckon we haven't.But it also says a lot about the movie and how it can be perceived and what attention to detail this has. Certain things and mechanisms really seem to be taken from what actually happens or coild happen behind the scenes. Bureaucracy at its best ... or worst I reckon. But with amazing actors to boost! And a triple does of Peter Sellers. There may not be any fighting in the war room, but there is also no love lost there.Funny, intelligent but also over the top, while simultaneously also feeling like it could be real. It's the end of the world as we know it ... at least on film and not reality of course ..."]
