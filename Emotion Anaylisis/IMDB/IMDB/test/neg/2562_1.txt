["THE GUEST (2014) **1/2 Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williamson, Joel David Moore, Ethan Embrey. Interesting-to-a-point thriller with stranger-in-town Stevens (uncannily resembling a very young Mel Gibson) who claims to be the friend of a dead soldier and infiltrates his family with charm and deceit unbeknownst to them of just how seriously dangerous he is as a threat to their lives. Menacingly charming Stevens does all the heavy-lifting of the touch and go script by Simon Barrett and Adam Wingrand's collaboration with steady assured direction with able support by Monroe as the shrewd teenage daughter, Meyer her younger bullied yet smart brother, veteran character actor as the out-of-sorts father and a nice return by Kelley as the blinded thru grief mother too trusting to a deadly fault. While the strengths play in large favor of its lethal lead the final act borderlines a slasher film with an incredibly eye-rolling plot point of just what really is making the homicidal hero tick."]
