['In 1930 a baby of the Armstrong family is kidnapped and held for ransom (this is obviously a reference to the Lindberg baby). The ransom is paid, but the baby is killed. Cut to 5 years later. Detective Hercule Poirot Albert Finney) is traveling to London on the Orient Express. An avalanche stops the train and a passenger (Richard Widmark) is found murdered. Who did it? Poirot has to question the all star cast to find out.This is a very big budget film. The sets and clothes are beautiful and the all star cast is having fun with their roles. Well-directed by Sidney Lumet too. Still this isn\'t that good. The movie is far too slow for its own good and I was getting bored by the end. The plot is (I thought) needlessly convoluted and Poirot\'s explanation at the end goes on forever. Also I thought the final revelation of who the killer was was more than a little unlikely.Still it is fun to watch an all star cast play suspects. The acting is pretty good--no one is bad. The standouts in the cast are Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Wendy Hiller and Ingrid Bergman (winning an Oscar). This led to "Death on the Nile" (which is much better) and "Evil Under the Sun" (good also but it bombed). So I give it a marginal recommendation for the cast alone.']
