["Both US and USSR are developing miniaturization technology. Dr. Michaels (Donald Pleasence) is attacked riding in an American military convoy. He, agent Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd), pilot Captain Bill Owens (William Redfield), surgeon Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his assistant Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch) are gathered for a special mission. Soviet defector Jan Benes developed technology to shrink indefinitely for the USSR while the US can only do it for 60 minutes. Jan Benes is in a coma after a failed assassination attempt and the group is miniaturized in a special submarine to destroy his brain clot.The start is a little slow and maybe that's why there's an action scene at the beginning. While the movie is old fashion, it is filmed expertly with energy. The first act has a lot of exposition work for the actors to get thru which does slow it down. The methodical miniaturization process is not quite thrilling enough. Once the sub goes into the body, the adventure begins. These are top notch special effects for its day. The designs are good. The submarine does restrict the action to some extend. Nevertheless, this is an old fashion sci-fi classic and it introduced Raquel Welch to many hot-blooded males. I would definitely help rip off those attacking cells for her."]
