['In Los Angeles, the wealthy owner of an art gallery Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) has a loveless marriage with Hutton Morrow (Armie Hammer), who is cheating on her. Out of the blue, she receives a book manuscript from her ex-husband Edward Sheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal) entitled "Nocturne Animals" and dedicated to her. They have been divorced for nineteen years and now Edward is asking for her opinion. The novel is about a man called Tony Hastings (Jake Gyllenhaal) that is traveling on vacation by car with his wife Laura (Isla Fisher) and their teenage daughter India (Ellie Bamber) through a lonely road. Out of the blue, a car bumps their car and throws them off the-road. The troublemakers Ray Marcus (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Turk (Robert Aramayo) abduct Laura and India while Lou (Karl Glusman) dumps Tony in an isolated road. Tony walks to the police station and ranger Bobby Andes (Michael Shannon) finds Laura and India raped and murdered. Meanwhile Susan recalls her relationship with Edward and rekindles her love for him. "Nocturnal Animals" is a deceptive movie by Tom Ford. The overrated IMDb rating associated to the names of Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal increases the deception of any viewer. Tony Hastings is a weak and unlikable character. The two segments are poorly resolved and the conclusion of each segment is awful. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Animais Noturnos" ("Nocturnal Animals")']
