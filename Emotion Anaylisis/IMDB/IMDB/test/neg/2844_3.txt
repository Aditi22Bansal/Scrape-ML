["As good an actor as he is, ROY SCHEIDER cannot reprise his role in the first JAWS and be half as effective if the script and director are not up to the challenge of producing a first rate sequel. Putting Scheider through the same paces again in Amityville, with the John Williams music looming over the soundtrack whenever appropriate, is not enough. There are no new elements to the story of shark attacks--and, in fact, it all seems just as mechanical as the shark itself that is shown once too often.Some of the shark scenes are effective, particularly the opening scene with the divers and the one with the girl on water skis, but the moment the film hits dry land the story hits rock bottom and drags on and on until the next incident. The presence of a few familiar faces doesn't really help. Missing are Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and the gripping story that made the first movie so terrific. As a replacement, we have some annoying teen-agers who've been warned not to go sailing just yet, one of whom is Scheider's son.As sequels go, this is barely fair...but the fright factor is not strong enough this time to prevent you from going into the water again."]
