['Now that I\'ve finally seen it I\'m kind of embarrassed to admit it. This film along with "One Million Years B.C" with Raquel Welch were a couple of the more highly publicized films of the mid-Sixties, neither one relying on much of a story to showcase it\'s lead actress. Watching today, I now know what I missed by not dropping acid during my college years. For myself, the only redeeming factor in checking out this flick was in directing me to learn how the British new wave band Duran Duran came up with it\'s name. I looked it up so you can to. Otherwise, the picture is more or less an hour and a half of soft porn interrupted by not much else. I did get a kick out of the scene when Barbarella got overwhelmed by all those parakeets and finches, a subliminal way that Jane Fonda\'s then husband and director Roger Vadim teased the male audience who might have wondered how she\'d handle all those little peckers.']
