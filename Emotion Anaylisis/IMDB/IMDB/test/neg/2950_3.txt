["Sly good ol' boy the Bandit (Burt Reynolds in peak amiable form) gets hired to haul 400 cases of beer from Texarkana to Atlanta in a mere 28 hours. Wily redneck trucker Cletus (a wonderfully spirited portrayal by Jerry Reed) helps the Bandit out while sweet runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field at her most adorable) tags along for the ride. Meanwhile, relentless and obsessive ramrod hick Sheriff Buford T. Justice (broadly played with lip-smacking brio by Jackie Gleason) gives hot pursuit. Director Hal Needham, working from a simple script by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer, and Alan Mandel, relates the entertainingly straightforward story at a constant swift pace, maintains an engaging good-natured tone throughout (although a lot of cars get wrecked, nobody ever gets seriously hurt), and milks the pleasantly irreverent humor for plenty of enormous belly laughs. Moreover, it's acted with real zest by an enthusiastic cast: Reynolds and Field display a strong and utterly charming natural chemistry, Gleason has a ball ad-libbing almost all of his hilariously profane dialogue, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Mike Henry as Justice's dim-witted son Junior, Pat McCormick as hearty blow-hard Big Enos, and Paul Williams as the sarcastic Little Enos. Bobby Byrne's sunny cinematography provides an attractive bright look. Further galvanized by a jaunty down-home score by Bill Justis, a first-rate rousing country soundtrack, and loads of well executed vehicular carnage, this affably unpretentious escapist fare sizes up as one immensely enjoyable romp."]
