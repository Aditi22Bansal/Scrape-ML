["A true thriller. Driver(Ryan Gosling) is one of those quiet guys that doesn't shy away from excitement. Multi-talented; well, let us say that Driver is well skilled. A Hollywood stunt driver and mechanic by day and quick moonlight getaway man. His life isn't mundane, but a bit isolated. Driver comes to the aid of a troubled neighbor Irene(Carey Mulligan)and her young son. The relationship begins showing some promise, until Irene's violent husband is released from prison. Driver's skills will soon be needed. A high price will be put on vengeance and survival. This story line is smooth as silk lubricated with rocket fuel. Some scenes are gruesome and the violence is, well violent. Gosling is outstanding. Mulligan is fine as the mousy love interest. The cast is rounded out with better-than-average performances from Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks. Kudos to director Nicolas Winding Refn."]
