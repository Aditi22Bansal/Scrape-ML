['Jittery, solemn melodrama, a would-be thriller, casts Sandra Bullock as a businessman\'s wife and the mother of two who seems to be living a tumultuous week out of sequence: one day she\'s being told her husband has perished in a car accident, the next morning she wakes to find him in the kitchen. It\'s nearly impossible (and useless) to pick apart screenwriter Bill Kelly\'s shuffled format when that format is the film\'s entire agenda, however certain sections of the movie simply do not gel (Bullock being accused of hurting her daughter and dragged out of her home by an imposing psychiatrist--she doesn\'t know what happened, but that doesn\'t mean everyone else should be in the dark). There\'s a bracing quality to the theme of the picture--do we attempt to stop fatal events from happening if we have an inkling of their outcome?--but that nearly gets lost here, mostly due to the writing; Kelly has created a group of stony characters who enter and exit rooms in a flash without proper communication. Good acting and technical values, but frustration builds instead of suspense. "Premonition" feels blunted, and one can sense director Mennan Yapo\'s indecision, particularly at the final gate which is just a passel of former scenes. **1/2 from ****']
