["OK, I cannot believe that Beerfest could ever be beaten. This is the absolute worst movie of all time.I don't know how anyone can think this was funny. There wasn't one laugh in it. It was more of a documentary on what is going to happen when NASCAR fans and reality show fans reproduce. I know that's cold, but they might find some humor in this.You have to be misogynistic, love fart jokes, and think that someone getting kicked in the balls is a hoot. What's up with that.Luke Wilson has made three movies that I know of with Will Ferrell. It has definitely screwed him up. He should buy the rights to this and destroy it."]
