["Diablo Cody's follow up to Juno. Its a nasty and illogical little horror film about what happens to Jennifer after a night at a roadhouse turns deadly. Put me into the camp of those questioning Cody as the next big thing, oh wait I'm already there. I don't think the film works. I found it surprisingly dull. Its way too knowing, often artificial. The dialog doesn't have the snap of Juno when it hits the witty notes (Cody won the Oscar so comparisons are inevitable, though not really fair). A large portion of this is Cody's fault since she crafted the story, which didn't work for me (I don't think she understands what she's sending up), and the dialog which sound at times like a copy of Juno.You also have to blame it on the director who seems to be filming some other type of movie that has a boy eating demon running through it. Nota horrible nasty disaster that some have called it, I just think its a miss"]
