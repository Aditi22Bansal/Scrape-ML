['I was immediately disappointed, the movie is in full color and yet it was set in the 1500s Mayan territory, I know they had not invented color cinematography yet, it should have been in black and white.Add to that the spoken Mayan language of the characters had English subtitles, I don\'t think that is authentic, how would the Mayans have known the English language in the 16th century?The movie focuses on Rudy Youngblood as Jaguar Paw, with a young son and a wife who is pregnant. When their small forest village is raided at night to capture women for slaves and men for sacrifices, Rudy hides his family in a deep pit and vows to return to save them. So that is really what the whole story is about, can Jaguar Paw escape and save his family? I enjoyed the last approximate one-third of the movie the most, the extended chase through the forest.The movie is loaded with graphic violence, and according to experts on Mayan culture not particularly authentic, but hey, it is a movie for entertainment. One reviewer called it a "Game of Thrones" for the Mayans.There\'s even a scene from "Field of Dreams", where several men run into a cornfield to try to disappear. Plus a line from "Midnight Cowboy", as in "Hey, I\'m walking here" as a Mayan escapes a falling tree.Overall a very mixed bag, I\'m glad I watched it, on Amazon streaming movies, but frankly it is mediocre.']
