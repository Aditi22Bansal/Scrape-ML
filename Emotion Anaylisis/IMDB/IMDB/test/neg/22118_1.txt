['The production and casting were superb. Immense care had gone into getting period details right, such as covering up the crosses in the churchyard (a Victorian innovation apparently). We were all therefore ready to suspend disbelief and enter Regency England once more. In their spare time they probably could have done another excellent, though unnecessary, adaptation of the book, but all the effort and budget went into another enterprise instead.The problem came in maintaining our disbelief once Amanda Price had been inserted. Only quite small disturbances would have been needed to put the original plot off course. Instead, Miss Price charged about, constantly putting her foot in it, which I often found it too "toe-curling". If Tourette\'s syndrome had been recognised at that time, she might have been carted off to the local quack.However one should not take the series too seriously. It was amusing and made a fair attempt at answering the questions: what would it have been like to have been dropped into that period, and how would people of that time have reacted to someone with our views? The notable omission is that we could not have avoided the lower strata of society and there our 21st century senses and sensibilities would really have come to the boil.']
