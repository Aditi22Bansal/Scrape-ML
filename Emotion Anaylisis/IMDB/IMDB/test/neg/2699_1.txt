["The movie was far better during the first hour when we see a very good boy, his poor widowed mother, both of whom are taking care of bedridden grandparents. They're caught up in this business of finding the golden ticket to the chocolate factory.As far as I'm concerned, the picture deteriorates with the boy finding one of the 5 tickets and his visit to the chocolate factory with grandfather Jack Albertson and some of the most obnoxious other children who get what they deserve at the visit.The tunes are delightful and was that really Jack Albertson singing? The film goes to show you that kindness is ultimately rewarded and selfishness does not go unpunished.The ending in itself proves that chocolate factory owner was sly, but a real child himself at heart."]
