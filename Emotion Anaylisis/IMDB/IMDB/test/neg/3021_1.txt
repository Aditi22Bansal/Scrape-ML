["This is a film like no other. Set in a period of great strife in a place of cold violence and indifference. This is a love story and a story of revolution. This is a portrayal of what is worst in humankind and what is best. We have a love story that transcends the elements and carries on to future generations. These are excellent performances by Julie Christie and Omar Shariff and impeccable direction by David Lean, who has produced some of the greatest works of the cinema. As we travel the endless vistas of the Soviet landscape we are given a taste of the Russia of the time, but there is threat at every turn. The young Yuri is shown the ugliness of politics at an early age and must confront this throughout his life. He is a man of great courage and compassion. If you've never seen this, by all means do so."]
