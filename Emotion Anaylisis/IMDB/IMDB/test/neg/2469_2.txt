["I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?"]
