['This film is about a young art student killing his insomnia by doing a supermarket night shift.The movie review I read compared this to "Amelie from Montmartre", so I had great expectations. While it does not exactly fall short of my expectations, it does not quite reach it completely either. The film is artistic, and many shots are imaginative. The most striking shot is the one where Ben falls from the phone to his bed. There are many jokes that work, such as the artistic value of a bag of spilled peas, and the silly moves by the Kung Fu guy. I really liked the dialogs, and the time freeze shots. If the nudity is toned down a little bit (the stripper scenes), then this would be an even better artistic film.']
