["Hopelessly terrible stomach churner based on Dr. Seuss' (one of those unbelievably over-rated authors) famous children's book. Youngsters Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are visited in their alternatively sickening world by the titled character (the always annoying and unwanted Mike Myers) and total chaos ensues with little explanation and a bare minimum of narrative strategy. The kids' mother/real estate agent (Kelly Preston) is hardly around at all. Ditto for sleazy neighbor Alec Baldwin (What in the world is he doing in this picture?) as he has the hots for Preston, gives the cold shoulder to the children and loses his cool when he sees Myers. Film-maker Bo Welch is an art director by trade and the production is clearly obvious and in-your-face due to that fact as the sets are elaborately built and painted over with every oddball color you can imagine. Myers' makeup job can be looked upon as revolutionary, spooky or a total failure. Boredom and migraines are prevalent early on as not only will the adults in the audience suffer, but the kiddies will too. Turkey (0 stars out of 5)."]
