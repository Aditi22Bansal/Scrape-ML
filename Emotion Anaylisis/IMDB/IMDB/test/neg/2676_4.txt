["OK, let's get the gripes out of the way first: Vaio, Google, Telegraph - product placement has rarely been so shamelessly placed in your face as it is in this romantic comedy that would have you believe it is a throwback to all those romantic comedies from the vintage years of Hollywood. Second gripe - Cary Grant was born in Bristol, a city in the county of Avon, some distance from the county of Surrey.The good things about this movie are that Kate Winslet, as always, is a hugely likable character (it's just a shame she felt the need to slim down about ten years ago); the sub-plot involving Eli Wallach's ageing scriptwriter, which is easily the most interesting strand of the film; and the fact that Jack Black is only 90% as annoying as he usually is and Jude Law acquits himself quite well as the romantic lead.Women will probably love this film; it's unashamedly, unrealistically romantic with a happy ending. Men will probably hate it - there's not an explosion or fist-fight in sight..."]
