["No scratch that. Chinatown is actually my personal favourite of Roman Polanski's movies. It is a wonderful movie, as well as an affectionate and inspired homage to film noir, with a lot to love about it.Roman Polanski's direction is superb. He always directs with such precision in this movie and it shows loud and clear.The production values are terrific. Chinatown does look ravishing, the costumes, detail, scenery and cinematography are all exemplary.I am a big Jerry Goldsmith fan, since seeing The Wind and the Lion and hearing his amazing score for that. His music score up here is up there with his best, it doesn't feel hackneyed or generic in any way, it really shows a master at work.The script is brilliantly organised. In fact along with Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve I think Chinatown has one of the best screenplays ever written.The story is never less than compelling. It is a wonderful story thet has just the right amount of intensity without being too convoluted and paced really well.The acting I also can't fault. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances and he is terrifically supported by a ravishingly beautiful Faye Dunnaway and a truly terrific John Huston.Overall, a wonderful movie and one of the best of the 70s. 10/10 Bethany Cox"]
