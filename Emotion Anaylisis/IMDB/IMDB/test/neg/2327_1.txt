["This movie is eerie, spooky, and creepy but never scary. I suppose that it's good that the main character, Ellison, was a true crime writer so that the viewers could be duly clued in on what was going on. In an attempt to write another best-seller, Ellison moved his family into the home where the subjects of his next book were killed.Layer by layer, super 8 film by super 8 film the story unfolded but to me it never amounted to more than a malevolent drama. There were never any real shocks or surprises and nor was there any real frightening moments. The movie is OK. The movie will keep you tense with the musical scores and the clich√© unexplained-noises-investigations-in-the-dark. But in the end many of those tense moments were met with disappointment."]
