['Early Wes Craven effort shows off the young filmmaker\'s burgeoning interest in everyday horrors. Craven, working on an extremely limited budget, creates a familiar scenario with ordinary people and then throws sadism, humiliation and murder into the mix (he did this again a few years later with "The Hills Have Eyes"). A drive-in variation on Ingmar Bergman\'s "The Virgin Spring", the film concerns two free-spirited young girls out to score some drugs but instead being abducted by escaped convicts. Craven has the germ of an interesting concept--allegedly based on a true incident--and he manages to mount the dread and terror effectively enough, but the movie is garbled and sludgy, not to mention depressing, with vapid, disgusting villains. Still, it\'s watchable until the revenge-laden second-half, which is so poorly written and executed it mitigates any real interest in the outcome. An almost-immediate cult success, "Last House" spawned many imitations ("House by the Lake", "I Spit on Your Grave", "Mother\'s Day"), but the movie lacks even the smallest semblance of class. * from ****']
