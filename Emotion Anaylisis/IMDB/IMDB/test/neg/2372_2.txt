['First things first: I have not seen any episodes of the original TV series this is based on. So no comparisons to that from me. This might have been a good thing from what I hear. But let\'s get back to this movie, that would\'ve faired worse if Captain Jack ... I mean Johnny Depp wasn\'t in it. My niece who watched it with me, said she could spot Capt. Jack mannerisms. I hope that does not spoil the movie experience for you, but I guess this is the curse or the bad side of having created a great character.Still that is not the weak point of the movie. Not even the weirdness, which I thought was nice mostly. But the movie itself is just not funny enough. It is pretty silly, but unfortunately not in a good sense. There is a scene where my niece went "That letter looks like ..." and while she was kidding I assume, I was still thinking "Kids" these days. But apparently Tim Burton thought the same thing ... He played right into that and it just doesn\'t work. Best scenes are in the trailer, the rest can be forgotten (including one very dark moment at a camp fire). Not as bad as his Planet of the Apes re-imagining, but still far away from his best efforts']
