["Linda (Sandra Bullock) and Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) are married in a suburban family home with two daughters. Sheriff Reilly tells her that her husband died in a car accident. She is heartbroken but she wakes up next morning to find Jim perfectly fine. Then the next morning after that is the funeral with her mother Joanne (Kate Nelligan) and best friend Annie (Nia Long). Her daughter Bridgette has terrible facial lacerations.This tries to be a loopy time jumping movie. Sandra Bullock does a good job portraying the confusion. The movie does confusion too well and intensity not well enough. It's a pretty boring confusing mess. I still give points for Bullock's acting but this is a hopeless exercise."]
