["My 15-year-old friends bought this DVD, so we watched it together. Totally sophomoric humor, I enjoyed some of it but overall it is just too stoopid to be funny as a movie. I thought Kareem Abdul Jabbar (formerly Lew Alcindor) as co-pilot was one of the better actors here. The scene, played up big in trailers, where the nose of the large airplane goes through the window, into the terminal. That isn't an airplane at all. It's actually a full-scale mock-up of Jimmy Durante's nose.  Its best rating is somewhere in the 3 to 5 range.SPOILERS follow -- in a cross-country flight passengers choose between meat and fish for dinner. Turns out the fish meals were tainted, everyone who ate them get deathly ill, including the pilot and co-. A former avaitor who became scared during a battle is a passenger, he is pressed into service to try and land the plane. Instantly forgettable movie."]
