['21 Jump Street was a late 1980s/early 90s action based cop show featuring Johnny Depp. A department of youthful looking cops who can mingle amongst young people.The film version goes for laughs with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing mismatched buddies who get recruited by the newly constituted Jump Street because of their youthful looks and go undercover in High School to break a synthetic drugs gang.On paper the film does not sound much, an old forgotten TV series being revived, starring two actors who outside of the USA would not cause much of a stir, Tatum being widely regarded as Mr Wooden.However the synthetic drug must have been put in these guys coffee as both Hill and Tatum give terrific performances.Tatum shows a talent for light comedy and has signs of a personality which have up to now remained hidden.The script is consistently funny and makes you laugh, the direction is very much spot on. The film does not outstay its welcome and even better, they bag star cameos from an original 21 Jump Street member or two.']
