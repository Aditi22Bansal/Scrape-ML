['I\'ve watched and reviewed a little over two dozen vampire flicks here on IMDb, and as a testament to how well received this one is by vampire fans, the only other movies that rate higher are "Nosferatu" and "Let the Right One In". Speaking of which, the character Petyr (Ben Fransham) in this one is a pretty straight knockoff of Nosferatu from the 1922 silent film. To call it a parody might be somewhat of a misnomer, the picture skewers everything from vampires to zombies, werewolves and anything remotely resembling the undead, and does it in hilarious fashion. The thing is, the picture doesn\'t feel like it\'s trying to be a comedy, but the zany situations and clever writing make you laugh even if you don\'t want to. There\'s also a fair amount of sleight of hand going on, as with Vladislav\'s (Jemaine Clement) horrific depiction of his archnemesis, The Beast. And then, when we finally meet The Beast (Elena Stejko), you have to kick yourself for falling for the set up. It\'s all cleverly done and quite entertaining, so even if you\'re not a vampire fan, this one might get you to change your mind.']
