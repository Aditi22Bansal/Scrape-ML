["Good lord, Adam Sandler so much looked like and sound like a trashy messed up grease ball! I can't tell you how many times that I thought he was on drugs, because seriously that man had such energy to play this character! Andy Samburg's character looked super cute in his tuxedo! I was thrilled to think he managed to have gotten Ciara's character. They just were made for each other. Thank god he didn't end up with his crazy fianc√©. She was so annoying! It was disgusting to think she cheated on her brother on their Wedding eve night. At least Donny was right the first time!I was so happy to see Ice-T, his 'Ice Ice Baby' was always stuck in my head every time he appeared. Man, I wish he was my uncle. He is awesome!This movie was alright but definitely, don't show the kids this!"]
