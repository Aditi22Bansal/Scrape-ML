["Teenagers Sandy (played by Olivia Newton-John) and Danny (John Travolta) have a summer romance but that seems to be how long it will last. Then they discover that they now both attend the same high school...Good musical-drama. Basic plot, but the movie is made by the music. Catchy, and keeps the story moving along.Decent performance by John Travolta. Olivia Newton-John is weak and unconvincing in her role though. Supporting cast is solid, though casting in general is a major problem. Who thought casting 20-somethings as teens when they don't look anything like teens would be a good idea? Doesn't help the plausibility."]
