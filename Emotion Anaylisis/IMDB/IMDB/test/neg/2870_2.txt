['This is an old classic available on nearly every old horror film multi-pack in various restored conditioned.A "party" is being held and 5 strangers are invited to spend the night with a reward of $10,000 in 1959 dollars. It is hosted by Vincent Price and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart). Nora Manning (Carolyn Craig) is set up as the "Final Girl" except that formula didn\'t exist. Special effects include doors closing by themselves, still used today in found footage films. It also has a floating head effect using a black background, common in 50\'s films. The sound track would be considered over-the-top camp by today\'s standards, but how else can you make this stuff scary? The feature includes Elisha Cook Jr., who would later defend Capt. Kirk when he was accused of neglect in the death of Finney. He always creates a great character. TV star Richard Long had the classic slick "Brylcreem" hair of the era with a big part on the left side, a style I was forced to wear until adulthood...scarred for life. Worth the flashback.']
