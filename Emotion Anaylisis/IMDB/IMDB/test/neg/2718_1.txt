["A diamond smuggling investigation leads James Bond (Sean Connery) to Las Vegas, where he uncovers an evil plot involving a rich business tycoon.While this is not the greatest Bond film, and some have said it is a sad farewell to Sean Connery, it does have its moments. For one, we have Q as a thief. I suppose being a spy agency's gadget man gives you some leeway, but I don't think you are supposed to steal from slot machines! As far as Bond girls go, Jill St. John is probably on the top half of a list running from best to worst. Strangely enough, I know her more as a mob moll than a Bond girl. Which makes the film's setting in Vegas all the more interesting."]
