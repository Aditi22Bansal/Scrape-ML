['The camera angles and jerky screen movements are designed to hide the fact that very little action is actually happening. The costume department is a cross between a Dan Dare comic and cheap child like pretend superhero clothing your aunty bought you when you were 8.I am a huge fan of science fiction but I am amazed at how poor this actually is. The props make the first series of Star Trek look good. That at least had the advantage of realistic characters and good story lines.I find it hard to believe it is intended for adults. There is so much decent scifi around now that this is really something of a timewaster.']
