['A wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder.This plot is simple yet extraordinarily complex in its own way and incredibly effective. What comes out of it is one of the most influential films of all time, and arguably Hitchcock\'s best (though others, including "Rope", could claim that honor).James Stewart is an impressive lead, and this is likely the finest role for Grace Kelly in her relatively short Hollywood career (before getting swept off to Monaco). Raymond Burr? Very subtle, as he is among the bigger stars here in a surprisingly small part.']
