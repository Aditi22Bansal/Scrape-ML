['This film is about James Bond cracking down a multi-national corporation that works with dictators to get a share of precious natural resources."Quantum Of Solace" has an impressive opening sequence. It has high speed car chases with lots of collision and gunshots. The ultra short scenes (all under one second each) and the shaky camera gives urgency and thrill, but it is so hard to actually work out what is happening.There is a lot of action and adrenaline in the film, but the plot seems not to have a focus. Nor does it make sense either, as it feels like an all-action-no-information film. All Bond does is to run around the globe after his target, and viewers are left to wonder how he made it. I don\'t find myself caring for the plot or the characters. I don\'t know why this happens, but something is not right with the film and I don\'t know what.']
