["I did not know who Aaron Hernandez was or what he did before watching this mini-series. I can't possibly understand the position he continuously put himself with all he had around him was success, money, a happy family. Easier said than done I know but it is truly surprising how such a young comes from nothing, wins everything and loses everything. It was helpful to understand the story and the events but I was hoping to see more like Making a Murderer type of thing. Maybe that's why it was just ok. If you already know the story, it wouldn't probably had anything new to your knowledge."]
