["To all shy freshman out there: You're certainly better off being introverted, especially after you see this rather odd film.Taken under the wing of two seniors in high school, our hero is a withdrawn young lad who craves for attention and is involved with his friend, better commonly known as his diary.This is certainly not your coming of age film. Dylan McDermott, as the father, and Ms. Cusack, who portrays the mother, have relatively little to do in the film.A wallflower would not have this kind of life. At least, our hero develops somewhat of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, though it is quite weird, which best describes the entire film.After the other two graduate and go off to college, our hero breaks down and we soon can guess what really happened to his aunt and what she had down to him.His course of therapy in the film is minimized. It would have been better to focus on the problem that drove him to an institution and to see his cure develop. Instead, he is cured too quickly."]
