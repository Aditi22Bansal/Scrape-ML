['Growing up, I remember first watching the last 30 minutes of this movie on ABC during the \'80s when Jackie Gleason said "sumbum" instead of that other word. I later watched it on HBO where I heard all the uncensored words. After Burt Reynolds died yesterday, I suddenly looked online for all his movies and because I knew this was perhaps his most popular, I had to watch this again! Verdict: It\'s more hilarious than ever! Especially whenever Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice appears! And seeing him and Reynolds in a scene at a restaurant was priceless! Oh, and this was also the first time Burt and Sally Field were paired on film and in real life. My God, they were quite a pair at the time, weren\'t they! And then there\'s Jerry Reed who not only helps The Bandit and Frog along the way but also provides the songs in the movie especially the classic "East Bound and Down" which is such an iconic theme for not only this movie but also Burt Reynolds\' life. Oh, and director Hal Needham keeps the action going throughout, that\'s for sure! So that\'s a high recommendation of Smokey and the Bandit for anyone curious about what the appeal of Burt Reynolds was...Update: 9/12/18-Just watched this again with my movie theatre-working friend at his AMC place with a pretty good crowd though I only heard me and my friend laughing...']
