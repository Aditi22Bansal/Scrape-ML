['For a movie which attempts to portray a mostly accurate portrayal it is curious to me they used his erroneous name of John, his real name was Joseph Carey Merrick. Still it is a very well made movie, in the 1880s England ordinary people did not know what to make of his deformities.I watched it at home, the 2-disc Criterion edition that I found at my local library. The second disc includes several interviews, including with John Hurt and director David Lynch.Good movie, should be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. Merrick died at age 27.']
