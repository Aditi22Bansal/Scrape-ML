['I can not believe that a lucid person can like this flick, unless a fan of Jennifer Aniston, or Kevin Costner, or Shirley MacLaine, or Mark Ruffalo. The plot is one of the most silly and ridiculous I have ever seen in a movie: Sarah Huttinger heard a rumor that her grandmother might have been the real "Mrs. Robinson" that inspired the successful movie "The Graduate". She decides to investigate the truth and finds that the man that had sex with her grandmother, had also with her mother and in the end she meets him and completes the fate of the women of her family also having sex with the guy. Is it funny? Have I missed some point about this dysfunctional family of whores? This rumor has no humor, is an awful lack of respect with "The Graduate" and a great disappointment. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Dizem Por Ai" ("It is Told That")']
