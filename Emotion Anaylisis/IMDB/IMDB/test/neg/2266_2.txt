["This TV mini-series may be of some interest to young audiences who enjoy the myths of the days of knighthood, dragons and sorcery. It's an okay film made by Hallmark, but nothing special. It's mostly about the magician Merlin and his ongoing battle with an evil witch, Mab. But she's even made up from the original legends of King Arthur and his knights of the round table.With only one dragon encounter here, and very little hand magic by Merlin, this series is mostly about feuding among clans for the kingship of ancient Britain, and semi-humorous attempts of the evil queen to try to control the history of the kingdom. Miranda Richardson is the best of the cast as Queen Mab and the Lady of the Lake. Martin Short is very good as Frik, and Helena Bonham Carter is good as Morgan Le Fey. Sam Neill seems bored with the whole thing and the rest of the cast are just so-so."]
