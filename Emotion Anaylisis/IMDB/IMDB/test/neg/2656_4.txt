['My summary line is true in so many ways - not just with the very (in)famous scene that kicks everything off. And why does it happen? Of course because of a missunderstood call to begin with - but the other one is Quarantine rules broken! Now if you read this during the 2020 pandemic ... yes I know quite disturbing and eerie. Also fodder for memes - at least for one that I have seen with the complete crew of the Nostromo.If you have issues with closed space, get paranoia and have problems with technology getting ahead of us ... well the movie will not do much to relieve you from them. Claustrophobia can be quite draining - but the set design here ... not even thinking about the low budget, this has aged quite well. What hasn\'t aged to well are the communication devices (same is true for the sequel). But that is really a small part of the whole experience. The special effects are amazing, the not seeing the Alien suspense much also works.This is a classic and something that while I\'ve heard people call "boring", is quite the opposite. Edge of your seat and a cast that is superb, an amazing script and many things just working for it. There is a reason this spawned so many sequels and it is also just great to have a female lead that is as strong as it gets.']
