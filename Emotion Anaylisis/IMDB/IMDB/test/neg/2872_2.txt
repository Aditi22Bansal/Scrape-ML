["The movie is about a strange rich guy (Price) who pays five seemingly random people to come to a party in a haunted house where seven people were supposedly murdered. Each is told if they stay the night, they will receive $10,000 in the morning. However, soon after this, murders begin occurring and everyone is terrified for their lives. The film does have a somewhat interesting twist at the end, though otherwise it's a haunted house film. It does try very hard and William Castle threw practically everything into this film to make it entertaining--except a decent script. Sure, it's fun to watch, but also pretty brainless--with lots of dumb plot devices and holes. For example, the home that all the people are in has a vat of acid in the basement under a trap door! Huh?! And, later, someone trips into it! Pretty clumsy, huh?! As far as the acting goes, it's not especially inspiring. Price is amazingly restrained in his performance--and I really wished he'd acted with a little more energy. Most of the rest of the actors were okay, though Elisha Cook should have been a tad embarrassed for his over-acting--he really was quite silly.Overall, the film is mediocre and very skip-able unless you are a huge Price fan."]
