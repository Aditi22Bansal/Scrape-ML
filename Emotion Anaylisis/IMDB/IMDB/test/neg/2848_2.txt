["Unlikable misfit factory worker Henry Spencer (a nicely deadpan portrayal by Jack Nance) lives in hellish squalor in a shabby apartment with his glum girlfriend Mary X (the pretty, but shrill Charlotte Stewart) and their grotesque constantly mewling mutant baby.With its jarring sound design, bleak industrial landscape, hypnotically gradual pace, funky old school practical special effects, and potently brooding gloom-doom mood fraught with dread, decay, and despair, David Lynch's debut full-length feature possesses a surreal nightmarish atmosphere that's uniquely its own singularly warped thing. Better still, the grim dream-like world presented herein proves to be so vivid, aberrant, and strangely convincing that once seen it's impossible to forget about. The interesting array of colorfully quirky secondary characters rates as another substantial asset: Allen Joseph as cranky plumber Mr. X, Laurel Near as a sweet and cheerful swollen-cheeked gal who lives in Harry's radiator, Jack Fisk as the badly scarred man in the planet, Judith Ann Robets as a seductive and predatory neighbor, Neil Moran as Henry's stern boss, and Darwin Joston as browbeaten desk clerk Paul. The striking black and white cinematography by Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell offers a wondrous wealth of startling and bizarre visuals. A fascinating one-of-a-kind oddity."]
