["David Lynch's first movie. Surreal, pretentious, meaningless nonsense. Was interesting for a while, but then just degenerated into nonsensical, random imagery.Only thing I learned from this is that David Lynch didn't start making pretentious crap with Lost Highway - it started with his first movie."]
