["I have let the story unfold over 5 episodes before writing this review.The character development is inconsistent, and the plot lacks any cohesion.The first season of Heroes, fully developed the character, before they were integrated into the plot line.This story line and plot, seem to be written by the same writers that went on strike in Season 2, and ruined a great show.Anyone familiar with the back story of Season 1 of Heroes, will find the characters actually annoying. Katana Girl and Ren (Hey let's call them what they really are: Ren and Stimpy) MUST die.They add nothing new to the story. It has been 5 episodes and I am just as confused now, as I was during the opening scene of Heroes Reborn.I tried to like this, but I can't. The characters are too plastic for anyone who knows the back story.What could have been a great viewing choice for a change, is just the same garbage recycled.As for me...I am waiting for the series finale of Downton Abby in 2016.There is absolutely nothing worth watching in the 2015 prime time TV season. Netflix to the rescue, once again.Wayno"]
