['Weak adaptation of "Odyssey, The", one of the most famous book of the Ancient Age. Assante is convincing as Ulisses but the rest of the cast gives shallow performances. The special effects are equally weak and the movie is too overlong. Some good scenes, however, like the battle with the ciclops in his cave. A average program for a lazy day.']
