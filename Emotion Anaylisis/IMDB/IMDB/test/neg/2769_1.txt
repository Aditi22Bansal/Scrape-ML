['Police officer Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is on the trail of a vicious killer who snipes his victims from high rooftops, and holds the city hostage. If he is not paid, the killings will continue. How do you stop a man with such a motive? This is probably Eastwood\'s best-known role. Sure, he is also the man with no name for Sergio Leone, but can you picture him any more clearly than with magnum, asking if you\'re lucky? This is also a great role for John Vernon who plays The Mayor. Perhaps better known as the dean in "Animal House" he really came through strong.I have to give the film credit for making this, so soon after the Zodiac Killer... I\'m sure the fear was still fresh for many in California. Scorpio is somewhat less scary than Zodiac, but his methods are so unpredictable, anyone\'s a target if they go outside.The Internet Movie Database also recommends the "Bird With the Crystal Plumage" if you like this film. I do not see the connection, but love that film, so I\'ll go ahead and recommend it here, too.']
