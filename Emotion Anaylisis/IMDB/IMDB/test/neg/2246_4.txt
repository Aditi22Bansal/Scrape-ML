["I liked this show. I kinda like the actor who plays Dracula. I think this show does some original stuff with the lore and that is pretty cool. It is the first time I've seen Dracula portrayed as someone who was bored and saw people as so beneath him that he passed the time by mistreating them. Yet he also was lonely and people were the only people he had to keep him company. There was some horror, some humor, some good acting and some bad. Some violent imagery in a few scenes that was kinda neat. It's not brilliant Dracula. (But it has moments,)"]
