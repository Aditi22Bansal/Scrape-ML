["The predictable film where an unknown virus spreads like wildfire throughout the world with the usual havoc resulting among the populace.We see the usual in such things-brave people, who are willing to risk their lives in search of a cure, those ready to exploit the situation such as the drug companies, people panicking while debate rages how much the people should be told. Of course, the president is hidden underground and various U.S. cities are quarantined. What else would you expect from this Irwin Allen-like disaster film?I don't have to tell you about the predictable ending. Imagine, the near beginning, when Gwyneth Paltrow, a victim of the virus, was cheating on husband Matt Damon and the Disease Control commission has to inform him of this. Terrible.The ending credits thank the Disease Control Commission. I say no thank-you to this routine rip-off film Jude Law, as the cynical reporter, has the best idea in that everything stinks-that sure includes this picture."]
