['Seriously, I am not a politically correct, "woke" or outraged person.But the idea that a scumbag mafia guy, is going to sexually assault his way into a woman\'s heart is not just absurd, but simply disgusting.Think Christopher Moltisante\'s "Cleaver" script within Sopranos with no dramatic irony. My guess is this film was financed by mafioso types. Exactly what attributes does this mafia leader have? He has brutishness, but he has no cunning, no leadership skills, and is not credible as someone who would rise through the ranks in anything, including organized crime.\nHe is about as sexy as a toad.The acting, dialogue, plot and cinematography are just amazingly bad and cringe-worthy. The makers of this spent more time shilling the review section here than they did writing this junk.']
