["In 1930 Long Island, the Armstrong girl Daisy is kidnapped. During the media circus, the family pays the ransom but the girl is found dead. Five years later in Istanbul, various people board the Orient Express. Famed detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) encounters his friend Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the line. Other passengers include American widow Mrs. Harriet Hubbard (Lauren Bacall); American businessman Samuel Ratchett (Richard Widmark), his translator Hector McQueen (Anthony Perkins) and English manservant Beddoes (John Gielgud); Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller) and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachel Roberts); Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi (Michael York) and his wife Elena (Jacqueline Bisset); British Indian Army officer Col. John Arbuthnott (Sean Connery); teacher Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave); timid Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson (Ingrid Bergman); car salesman Antonio Foscarelli (Denis Quilley); and American theater agent Cyrus B. Hardman (Colin Blakely). Ratchett tries to hire Poirot claiming to be in danger. Later, he's found stabbed to death.This production is overflowing with acting masters. It can be overwhelming to keep track of the numerous characters and the various clues. It is a master class of acting and mannerisms. It is a little slow and old-fashion considering its over two hours running time. It is classic whodunit. Overall, it is impeccably made by director Sidney Lumet."]
