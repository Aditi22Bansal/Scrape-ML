["It's the year 3000. Earth has long been conquered by the Psychlos. Humans are used as work slaves. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) leaves his remote tribe to explore. He finds some surviving humans. The Psychlos capture him and others to use as slaves. Terl (John Travolta) is a Psychlo who is stuck on earth after crossing a senator. With new pay cuts coming to the labor force, Terl has the idea to train the human slaves to operate machinery and replace the paid labor. It's a secret and illegal initiative with the help of his second Ker (Forest Whitaker). They use a learning machine on Jonnie. Eventually Jonnie learns enough to start a revolt.This is an universally panned movie and it deserves it. It is ugly looking. The plot is badly written. Travolta's acting is too ridiculous. The sad part is that all of them are deliberate choices. They are all simply wrong choices. There is a nugget of an interesting idea in here somewhere. Enslaved humanity revolting against an alien mining company could maybe work. Pepper is a pretty good actor but he's overwhelmed. Whatever hope this had is lost pretty quickly."]
