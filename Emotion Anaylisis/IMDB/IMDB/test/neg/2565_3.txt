["This has Ben Stiller written all over it and I for once don't really mind. Lewd and crude and funny enough to crack a rib or two. Some cool action shots with rapid fire comedy. Three of Hollywood's biggest and temperamental stars are in the jungles of Vietnam shooting a war movie when everything gets too damn real. Tugg Speedman(Stiller), Jeff Portnoy(Jack Black) and Kirk Lazarus(Robert Downey Jr.)along with supporting actors and crew find themselves invading a real poppy processing location thinking they are still shooting the movie. Comedic lines fire off as rapid as automatic weapons. I personally am impressed the most with Downey Jr., who's character has his pigmentation dyed to play the role of a black soldier. The rotund Black handles most of the real crude stuff. A heavy soundtrack features the likes of: Creedence Clearwater Revival, Buffalo Springfield, The Rolling Stones, Edgar Winter and Enigma.Also starring are: Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte, Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel.If there is a show stealer it is a well padded and made up Tom Cruise playing the movie's producer. Pee your pants hilarious. TROPIC THUNDER also has wall to wall cameos...to mention just a few:Jon Voight, Lance Bass, Jason Bateman, Alicia Silverstone, Kevin Pollack and Mickey Rooney."]
