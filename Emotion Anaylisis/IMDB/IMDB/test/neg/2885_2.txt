["Of course, for any moviebuff, any western movie buff, especially any feminist in the action film genre, the absence of Barbara Stanwyck can be noticed. It would have been the prefect film for her, any role here - McCambrige or Crawford's one - would have fit Stanwyck like a glove. If you think about MAVERICK QUEEN, FORTY GUNS, CATTLE QUEEN OF MONTANA or THE FURIES, you'll see what I mean. But those four latest westerns are in a bit lesser scale than this one, which is a pure masterpiece. Ben Cooper's physique reminds me Audie Murphy, but maybe not the character though."]
