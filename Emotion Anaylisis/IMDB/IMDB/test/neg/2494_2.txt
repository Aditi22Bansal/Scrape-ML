["Jaguar Paw leads a hunting party in the jungle with his father. They encounter refugees escaping from an unknown danger. Their unprepared village is attacked by a Mayan hunting party. Most of the adults are enslaved and brought to the city. The land is suffering from drought and plague. The male prisoners are being sacrificed. There is a solar eclipse just as Jaguar Paw is about to be sacrificed. The men are given an opportunity to run for their freedom. When Jaguar Paw escapes, the Mayan warrior leads a chase to avenge his son who is killed by Jaguar Paw.The first half of this movie is absolutely harrowing and brutal. It is powerfully shot by director Mel Gibson. The little kids are heart-breaking. His escape and journey has a few too many coincidences. I buy the jaguar as some kind of prophetic sign just like the solar eclipse. However, he doesn't need to rescue his wife and kid just in the nick of time. The final image also doesn't need to be that. It seems to suggest something that isn't quite warranted. All in all, it can't be denied that this is wonderful filmmaking."]
