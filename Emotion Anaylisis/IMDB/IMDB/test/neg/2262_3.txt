['The only problem with this version was the lack of money put into exterior shots and special effects.In fact, scenes in the desert were filmed on a pile of dirt with a panoramic backdrop surrounding the actors.But where this film suffers in lack of scope for what should have been a vast expanse, is made up for in true to the book story and timeline of events.I wish we could have the exteriors and effects from the David Lynch version imported to this version.But even with the faulty special effects and exterior sets, the production value of this modest made for sci fi channel miniseries had us glued to our TVs for 3 days in 2000.I was later given this on VHS, and then later on DVD and later in HD. I just got done watching it twice through and then Children of Dune twice.Both brilliant, but this first part is the best of the two.']
