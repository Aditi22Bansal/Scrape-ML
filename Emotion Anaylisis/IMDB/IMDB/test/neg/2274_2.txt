['i will say first off that the idea of this is really good. But did anybody notice how bad the script was and the acting i was actually laughing and rewinding because it was so terrible. the problem when i watch a show and i actually notice something like the script or the acting being crappy thats really not a good thing. like when the tin man says" keep your head cool before you lose it" thats when i lost it. and When DG and Glitch get attacked and in a really stale voice DG says lets get outta here i burst out laughing. so i am done my rant almost. i also found that the sets were really fake in the fact that it looked like the actors never actually were moving i don\'t know if that is only me. even after all that i have to at least give this a 5/10 for the idea and being somewhat entertaining.']
