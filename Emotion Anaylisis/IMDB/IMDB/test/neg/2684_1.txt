['Some movies just confuse me. They have fabulous reputations but I find them difficult to like due to their excessive and pointless violence. Well, I may just be "out of touch", since this movie is in the top 50 on IMDb ratings. However, I also worry that this film and other ultra-violent films like SCARFACE (the Pacino version) are adored by so many. We live in a violent world--that\'s a fact. And, I wonder how much of that violence is either exacerbated by it or it encourages good people to become desensitized to violence or even find it exciting. I hope to think I am better than that.Now I am not saying that there weren\'t some really good elements to the movie and it was very well made. But, the film is so thoroughly soaked in violence and human waste that the good is grossly overshadowed. Just because the people De Niro kills at the end are bad guys doesn\'t mean it is entertaining or less offensive. Regardless, these sort of films are not something I enjoy.']
