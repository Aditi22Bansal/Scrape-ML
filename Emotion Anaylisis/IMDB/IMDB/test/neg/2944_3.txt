["This is an iconic film, and anything I say in this review will not change that.It features some of the best film chemistry of all time in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and lots of great, often still quoted lines to this day.I enjoyed the film, I thought it had some great moments, but the western genre isn't really my thing and I can't say that I'd rush to see this film again.That's not to take away from its obvious quality though."]
