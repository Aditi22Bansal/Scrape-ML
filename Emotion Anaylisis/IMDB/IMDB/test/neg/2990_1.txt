['Unfortunately, it appears that I saw Dario Argento\'s best film, "Suspiria," first, and none of the ones I\'ve seen subsequently measure up to that one.All of the imagination Argento could muster for this serial killer story went in to staging a few elaborate and gruesome murder scenes. Too bad that all of the scenes connecting those moments are a dull bore. And the movie overstays its welcome by at least half an hour.What seemed novel in "Suspiria" begins to seem like limitations when you realize that Argento couldn\'t do anything else. His attention to style can only go so far in making up for the lack of good plotting, acting, character development and just about everything else that separates good films from bad ones.Grade: C-']
