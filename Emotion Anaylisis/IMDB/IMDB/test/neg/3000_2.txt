["I had been putting off watching Sunshine for ages, believing it to be nothing more than an overblown, CGI packed, 'disaster/end of humanity' film along the lines of Armageddon. Having just finished the film, I can report that, although there are plenty of CGI effects, Sunshine is nothing of the sort: it's actually a boring, pretentious, and sober piece of 'serious' sci-fi that makes little or no senseâ€”one that makes me almost wish I'd popped Michael Bay's asteroid crap-fest in my DVD player instead.The film starts off promisingly enough, with the crew of the spacecraft Icarus II killing time until they arrive at their destination, the Sun, where they hope to 'restart' the dying star by dropping a massive bomb into its heart. Things starts to go 'tits-up', however, once the crew discover the remains of a previous failed mission and attempt to recover its payload (in order to double their chances of success); at this point, Sunshine gradually becomes nothing more than a glut of confusing special effects designed to mask the fact that the script has become an indecipherable mess.In fact, Sunshine is so bad, I find it almost impossible to believe that it came from the same man that gave us the excellent 28 Days Later, and who would, soon after, receive the Academy Award for Best Director. It's a strange old world."]
