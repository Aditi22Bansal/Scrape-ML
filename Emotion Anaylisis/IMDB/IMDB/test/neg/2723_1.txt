["Ever since Mike Myers mercilessly mocked You Only Live Twice in Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, it's been impossible to take this particular Bond adventure seriously; but to be honest, the film was always pretty ridiculous in the first place, stretching plausibility further than ever before in an effort to up the ante in terms of crowd-pleasing spectacle.The basic plot is solid enough—SPECTRE steals US and Russian spacecraft in a bid to start a war that will turn Japan into the world's leading superpower—but the excess of silliness on display virtually turns this into self-parody. A giant lair, complete with monorail, hidden inside a volcano; a ninja army; Little Nellie, a stupid looking auto-gyro that proves unbeatable in an aerial battle against four regular helicopters; Bond posing as a Japanese fisherman: all a far cry from the rawness of the first two Connery movies (no surprise then that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, author of many a classic book for kids).As a fan of all things Japanese, I enjoy the setting, the karate, and the women, and Blofeld's piranha filled pool is a cool touch (every self-respecting megalomaniac should have one), but its not at all surprising that You Only Live Twice marked the end for Connery as Bond (at least for a while), the star being replaced by George Lazenby for the secret agent's next adventure."]
