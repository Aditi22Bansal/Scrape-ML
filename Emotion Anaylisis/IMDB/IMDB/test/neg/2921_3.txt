['In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people.What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the "Flash Gordon" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one.I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.']
