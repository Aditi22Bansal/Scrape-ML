['As I sit here thinking about this movie, I am realizing that this is one of the few comedies I wouldn\'t mind if it were heavily edited first. In other words, if all the funny moments (i.e., all the stuff with Rodney Dangerfield) were shown and the rest of the film pitched in the trash, I DON\'T think that would be so bad. That\'s because despite it\'s achieving "cult status", this isn\'t all that good a film--with sloppy direction, an annoying performance by Bill Murray (who is capable of so much better), a worthless story about some teenagers (and I HATE most teenager movies from the 70s and 80s) and a rather wooden performance by Chevy Chase. Hmmm,...now that I think about it, apart from Rodney Dangerfield and, perhaps the cute groundhog, there isn\'t a whole lot I loved about the film. A sub-par film saved by genuinely funny dialog between Dangerfield and Ted Knight.']
