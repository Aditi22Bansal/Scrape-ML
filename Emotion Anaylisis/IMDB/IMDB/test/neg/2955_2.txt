["I used to think that the old B&W horror films from Universal in the '30s were the best of their kind--atmospheric and creepy.But Hammer's HORROR OF Dracula makes me realize that adding Technicolor and fangs to the proceedings, with a bombastic background score to emphasize every startling moment, really makes the Dracula tale come alive.The acting here is in the best British tradition with PETER CUSHING giving us a great Van Helsing and CHRISTOPHER LEE baring his fangs with blood-smeared lips to create the illusion of a perfect Dracula. MICHAEL GOUGH is also very effective as the man who helps Cushing when he realizes the truth about vampires.Production values are first rate with the color photography able to create just as much dark atmosphere as the old B&W cobweb settings did. I must emphasize that the jolts become more effective thanks to a marvelous score by James Bernard.Summing up: One of the best horror classics of its kind told in brisk style so that not a moment of screen time is wasted."]
