['No, I had not read Le Carre´s novel and not seen the film (personally, as to thrillers, I tend not to compare but try to enjoy the course of events without knowing the next stages and solutions), but I was intrigued by the era, plot and some actors (Michael Shannon and Alexander Skarsgård). The two gentlemen were good as always, but the depiction seemed protracted (perhaps 4 episodes would have been enough?) and it lacked "succulence", with brickle transition points... Moreover, I was not too keen on Florence Pugh, she did not excite my interest to find out where else she has performed.All in all, not a bad stuff, but I could mention dozens of BBC miniseries that are catchier for me. But admirers of the 1980ies, Shannon and Al. Skarsgård would not be disappointed.']
