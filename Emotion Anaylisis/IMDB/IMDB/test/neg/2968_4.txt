['A young Clint Eastwood and the late Lee Van Cleef star in this typical spaghetti western.An alternate title may have been "Mutiny Among The Bounty Hunters."The film starts off with the exploits of Van Cleef and Eastwood as bounty hunters. They shoot their hearts off and along the way, they collect nice money while lodging bullets in the heads of their wanted outlaws.Their big task is to get a noted outlaw, who with a group of 15 others, is planning a major bank robbery. Turns out that one of the bounty hunters wants him for personal reasons as well.The film is often slow paced. It\'s entirely too violent for our tastes. The scene where our major bandit blows away a young mother and her 18 month old is not shown but you feel the emotion when the gun goes off and off.']
