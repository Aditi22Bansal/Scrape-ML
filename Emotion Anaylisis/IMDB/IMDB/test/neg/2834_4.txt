['a good adaptation. and, more important, the most seductive. because the mystery is the basic spice. not faithful to the novel but seductive demonstration of the talent of Kubrick to explore a sensitive theme. Peter Sellers is the master and James Mason does his the best as Humbert in a film who explores in great manner the sensuality and ambiguity of a relation who is presented by inspired allusions. short, one of films who must see. for atmosphere. for performances. for music. and for the force of the first scene. because it is not only a film by Kubrik. it represents a key to his universe, and, in same measure, for the period.']
