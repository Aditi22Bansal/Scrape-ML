['Greetings again from the darkness.  Just attended the Dallas screening of the new digital version from Texas Instruments new digital projection system.  The colors literally jump off the screen.  Specifically, the scene where Rock Hudson and Paul Fix are in the car and Liz Taylor rides by and stops to wave to "dad", the black coat on her steed just shines like fresh paint.  This has always been a controversial film - too long, can\'t understand James Dean, too many racial elements, etc.  I love the film and appreciate it\'s many elements.  Real life for the 3 stars was remarkably unforgiving, but during this film we see each in their prime.  Liz was probably the most beautiful woman in the world, Rock Hudson at his most virile and James Dean acting playful and parodying his media image at the time.  So very sad that we were not able to see what this man could bring to film as he matured.  Fresh faced Dennis Hopper giving no indication of the decades of drug abuse that lie ahead.  Chill Wills provides the comic relief and most of the best one liners.  Mercedes McCambride exemplifying a woman\'s fear of not being needed.  Carroll Baker as the innocent, bright eyed youngster being used as a pawn and the pain associated when she realizes. So many great moments that the faults fade away.']
