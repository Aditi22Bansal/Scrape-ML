["Mike Flanagan's OCULUS gives our thoughts something familiar to focus on and then the small details turn things a bit askew. This movie is slow burning and moody. A couple of young adults, Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites)and his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) are still mystified by their patents death. It has been a decade and Kaylie is more of a hands-on thinker, while her brother is the typical skeptic. She is strong in her belief that an antique mirror is to blame some how for her parent's demise. She is determined to prove it. A haunted mirror; this is enough to have you brace yourself and let your skin tingle.Other members of the cast: Katee Sackoff, Rory Cochrane, Garrett Ryan, Miguel Sandavol and Kate Siegel."]
