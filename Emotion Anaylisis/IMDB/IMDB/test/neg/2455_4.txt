['My 17 year old neighbor warned me, she had seen this movie at the theater with her boyfriend and she told me to stay away, it isn\'t a very good movie. Well, it was a "free rental" from my public library, so what the heck? The premise is interesting -- radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing from 1945 to the early 1960s caused a sub-race of mutants that are very, very mad. And love to kill things and eat them raw. A family heading west on vacation stops at an out of the way gas station and are told of a "shortcut" that turns out to be their undoing. The main of the movie is to see if they and their dogs will survive in the rugged desert hills against these mutants. Hint -- they don\'t all make it.The movie uses blood and gore for shock value, a number of times. The best thing about the movie is that I was very glad when it was over.']
