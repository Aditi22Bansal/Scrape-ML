["I din't know this bad story and it left me partly shocked. Sure the most strange and disturbing (failed) bank robbery of all times.The story covers many years and I have to give Kudos to the production for prsuing the story and its developments till the (maybe) end.I have only two reservations about the conclusion:1) The story ends telling us that the master mind of all this was Marjorie, but this is based only on the confessions of two of the four men involved in the main crime (the other two died before the discover of the facts), men that have all the interest to paint a scene of this colour. Surely she was present ma depicting her as the only and main force behind the planning, while there was his friend William Rothstein that often seems to have been in charge to do pseudo-clever mad machinations, seems a little far fetched to me.2) Brian Wells during the robbery seems very calm, too calm for one that had a ticking bomb attached to his neck. At one point we are given the information that while exiting the bank he did a Charlot-like walk like he was kidding. Is not this strange? Maybe he didn't know that the bomb on his chest was real?"]
