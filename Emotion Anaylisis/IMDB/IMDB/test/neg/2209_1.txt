["Overall I can see why this movie got bad reviews and wasn't a hit. The story is more painful and unpleasant than entertaining. The characters are not interesting and you don't feel for any of them especially Ginnifer's character who isn't very endearing. She falls in love with her best friend's fianc√© - what's to like? It is a waste of a good cast. Colin isn't that hot that he is so out of Ginnifer's league. Kate's character is slightly irritating. And John's is just plain lame. The missed opportunity is a bit of a silly thing to be a central story line. Don't bother with this one even if you are a fan of the actors - it's just a silly story about nothing much. It's a movie that didn't have to be made."]
