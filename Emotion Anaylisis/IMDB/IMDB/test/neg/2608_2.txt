['Picture this: a post-apocalyptic closed society maintains a series of social strata, but then one young person doesn\'t conform. Sounds like "The Hunger Games", doesn\'t it? Well, "Divergent" also uses this story. I had never heard of this series before the first movie got released. Having seen the movie, I can only conclude that they simply used the idea behind "The Hunger Games" and added a bit of Harry Potter (the serum-induced psychological test to determine a person\'s faction reminded me of the Sorting Hat).So, this franchise doesn\'t come across as anything original. I wish that someone would film Kim Stanley Robinson\'s "Years of Rice and Salt".']
