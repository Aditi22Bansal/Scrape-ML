['I was amazed by this horror movie. Americans would not have made better. No lead character. No super female hero who finally punishes, destroys all the bad guys before getting away. The movie begins with characters who rapidly die, and continues with other ones who also disappear in an orgy of violence, sadism and unbearable sequences of brutality and torture. For the actor and the spectator...You\'ve understood. That\'s not for the sissies. Many people will consider it as "too much".But as I told about "Fronti√®res", when you go to see a horror film, it\'s not necessarily for laughing; it can also be for feeling dizzy.']
