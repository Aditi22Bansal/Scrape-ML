"['""Luca"" is Pixar\'s boldest attempt yet at an LGBTQ+ friendly film, though apparently it\'s still subtle enough (hard for me to believe) for the gay themes to go right over a viewer\'s head. My mom, for instance, didn\'t catch any of it at all.I had low expectations going in, but I found this movie to be very sweet and pretty delightful. Jacob Tremblay does terrific voice work as Luca, and the relationship between the two male characters at the story\'s center, whether you choose to read it as a coming out story or just a very close bond, is touching without being aggressively manipulative in that way Pixar movies can sometimes be.Plus, the pasta in this movie looks soooooo good that my family went on an Italian food binge for about a week after seeing it.Grade: A.']",Positive
"['The savage team of a tug is ready to rest after the transportation of a platform. When they are celebrating in a bar, the plane pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) offers them the chance of rescuing a passenger vessel vanished in the oceans in 1962. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) and the rest of the crew, tempted by the possibility of a great reward, decides to risk one more rescue operation before going home. Their greed leads them, of course, to a ghost ship, where they are spooked and threatened by ghosts. One of them, a little girl, shows Epps what happened to the passengers and crew during the voyage in 1962. A horrible unraveled secret will haunt the rest of the crew. Ghost stories usually take place in a haunted house. This one is in a passenger ship. This movie is not in the same level of \'The Others\', \'The Shining\' or \'The Sixth Sense\', but is also good film. The screenplay play has some clichÃ©s and is predictable, but the cast, direction and special effects work well. Probably, the fans of romances will not like it, but those who like a ghost story will appreciate this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Navio Fantasma"" (""Ghost Ship"")Note: On 02 June 2017, I saw this film again.']",Positive
"['This is a super (if rather freely) adapted version of the Alcott story about a family of sisters as they come of age towards the end of the American Civil War. I suppose that I do, personally, prefer the 1949 version - it has a little more feistiness. In this iteration though, Saoirse Ronan is great as the independently minded author determined to go through life on her own terms; no mean feat at the time. Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Laura Dern are good too as her sisters/mother respectively (though the accents are a wee bit dodgy on occasion). Meryl Streep has some cracking one-liners and has her facial expressions perfected. The star for me, however, is TimothÃ©e Chalamet - he plays the charming but emotionally fickle ""Laurie"" in a thoroughly captivating, engaging manner. The attention to detail is impressive and Alexandre Desplat\'s score helps the whole thing to come alive. It does sag in the middle; could perhaps do with shaving 15-20 minutes to tighten it up a little, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining watch.']",Positive
"['The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table. It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads. Diabolically clever satire.Guide: F-word. No sex. Butt nudity at end of film.']",Positive
"['This film tells the most severe case of haunting Ed and Lorraine Warren, two outstanding paranormal investigators, have ever seen.I am not a fan of horror movies, but ""The Conjuring"" truly blew me away. Everything from the plot, acting and the atmosphere of the film is superb. The story is believable, the family is likable and viewers are sympathetic of them stuck in a haunted house. The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, ""The Conjuring"" builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it. It is easily the scariest film I have ever seen.I was already impressed by ""Insidious"", and ""The Conjuring"" makes me a fan of James Wan. When his next film comes out I will surely watch it.']",Positive
"['Perhaps not as scary as ""The Exorcist"", ""The Conjuring"" still has it\'s moments, relying on a slow build of tension and paranoia that manifests as demonic possession in the character of Carolyn Perron (Lilki Taylor) when the story really hits it\'s stride. The picture is based on the real life work of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, depicted in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. I didn\'t know this picture pre-dated 2014\'s ""Annabelle"", so was taken aback a bit when an opening scene made use of that character. Ultimately, Annabelle\'s connection with the movie is not notable in and of itself, except as a centerpiece of the real life Warren\'s occult museum. There\'s a scene in the movie that\'s reminiscent of Hitchcock\'s ""The Birds"" which I thought was a little too obvious given the genre but it doesn\'t linger too long. The horror effects in the film are rather sensational, especially those that place members of the Perron family in harm\'s way by invisibly and violently thrashing them around; the upside down seated Lorraine on the ceiling was particularly chilling. When the main story is over, a reference is made that horror movie insiders will understand when Ed Warren makes note of an investigation he and his wife are about to undertake in Long Island. It\'s not mentioned by name, but fans will recognize it as ""The Amityville Horror"".']",Positive
"['a return. to the rules of classic horror. the comeback of tension and authenticity and role of acting as more than ingredient of screams. Conjuring has a solid story . and this is used in wise, subtle, credible manner. the fight against evil has new form and flesh. the ambiguity becomes more important than the shadows of blood. the tragedy of a family has not only impressive but so realistic than impose to the viewer a strange old emotion - to be part of the story. sure, Conjuring is not the only example of return to classic horror model from the last decade. but it is one of great films who reminds the basic purpose of cinema. to convince. to give force and substance and to convince the public. not a show. but a real good story. this does it a remarkable work.']",Positive

"[""Well maybe not so scary, more creepy from times to times. But only in a good way. This movie is yet another great fantasy tale from Tim Burton. And it seems, that he has special skills for fantasy tales. Skills that seem to go amiss, when he's shooting Sci-Fi movies, but that's another story.Let's concentrate on this movie, a fairy tale starring his favorite actor Johnny Depp. But since it's an animated movie, it's his voice you'll get to hear. And since it's animated, Mr. Burton can again relish in big faces and big eyes. Something he is very fond of (maybe from the time he worked at Disney? I don't know, could be, despite the fact he left Disney as young frustrated animator). But it's the story that will get you excited, it's very crazy and seems to be in the same vein as Edward Sciscorhands!""]",Positive
"['The second ""animated"" feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993\'s THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot\'s perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I\'d say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn\'t lessen in any way the latter\'s remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.']",Positive
"['it is admirable. because it represents a lovely remember of the small things who define the life. because it is a love story who has, in the perspective of Tim Burton, fascinating nuances. a simple story about an insignificant error, its consequences and the new arrangement of life. a pledge for kindness and the thin border between worlds. all in the skin of refined romanticism, gray, cold and seductive. the idea is not exactly new but this represents one of the basic virtues of the film. because, at the first sigh, all seems predictable. but the delicate art to use the expected sides of story is the most important thing. so, a simple story. and a lovely animation , for the songs, characters and humor. and, sure, for the story.']",Positive
"['Tim Burton presents his dark, but comedic style in stop-motion animation. THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS(1993) was a critical and theatrical success; and this black comedy is just as much fun to watch. The visuals are just outstanding; beauty comes in many forms.

"[""Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) leaves Phoenix and her mother to live in Forks, Washington with her dad Charlie who is the Chief of Police.

There are suspected animal attacks but that turns out to be supernatural as well.It's stupid that vampires have to go to high school. There are lots of things about this movie and this franchise to pull apart. At its core, the movie is saved by a compelling coupling of Stewart and Pattinson.

While attending high school there she become attracted to light-skinned Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). He is attracted to her also--but he turns out to be a vampire! I heard lots of negative things about this (that it didn\'t match the novel and looked cheap). While it\'s no masterpiece it\'s not that bad at all. It has a good score (especially when Bella discovers Edward is a vampire) and has beautiful locations. The sometimes clunky dialogue from the novel has been replaced (or written out completely) and the story moves very quick (the novel is over 500 pages). There\'s also excellent makeup and special effects used sparingly (which makes them all that more effective). Also the evil James is well played by Cam Gigandet and the final battle is actually pretty frightening. In terms of acting almost everyone is good--especially Pattinson who is just great. On the bad side--the movie seems somewhat muted (for some reason). Stewart is just OK (but she DID turn 18 while the movie was being filmed so that might have affected her acting). Also Burke is terrible as her father and it had a stupid ""it isn\'t over"" ending which wasn\'t in the book! Still, this was well-made and done and worth catching. I give it a 7.']",Positive
"[""Based on Stephanie Meyer's enormously popular best selling sensation; a story of love at first stare.

"['Or maybe you like it even more for not being part of the other Marvel movies. Even if it refers to some of the characters (especially the X-Men, since this is mostly owned by 20th Century Fox). I never read the comics, but did have the pleasure of playing the game on my Playstation. And I did think it was hilarious.The ""wink wink"" humor of it, is not everybody\'s taste of course, but if you like movies breaking the fourth wall (beginning with the opening titles), than Deadpool is speaking directly to you - kind of literally. He also is as offensive as possible and still very likable. Which is a testament to the lead actor. Reynolds seems a perfect fit for this, leaving behind the ""shame"" of being ""green"" (another Superhero he played, not as successful, if you even can remember that).Even if you saw the trailer, there are so many jokes in here, you will find many things to like. Unless you are more of straight kind of jokes guy/gal ... no pun intended. But then you better steer clear of this anyway ...']",Positive
"[""I was in two minds about watching DEADPOOL. On the one hand, I generally enjoy modern-day superhero movies, which are very much all of a kind but have decent special effects and lots of action to see them through. They're easy viewing. On the other hand, I'm no fan of crude humour and bad language, and I knew what to expect with this one. I don't think much of Ryan Reynolds, either. I was pleased to find, then, that I enjoyed DEADPOOL quite a bit. It's not one of my favourite superhero films but as an origin story it does the job nicely and there are lots of memorable quirky moments and characters to enjoy. As a comedy, it's also a lot wittier than I was expected, and I enjoyed picking up all of the pop culture references. The crudeness did nothing for me but most of it was in the form of throaway lines so didn't matter too much. The strong supporting cast features an on-form Ed Skrein and a typically hulking Gina Carano, but Colossus was my favourite 'star' here. The CGI-augmented action scenes are well staged and the action has a nicely brutal edge. To me, this feels like a natural successor to the CRANK films, albeit better made.""]",Positive
"[""It's eight months after the Blip, the moment when the people who got dusted in the Snap return after over five years. It's a period of readjustment as those people come to terms with the world five years later. Tony Stark is gone and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) has to fill some very large shoes. He and his friend Ned Leeds are set to go on an European school trip. Peter is struggling to make his move with MJ (Zendaya). In Venice, they are attacked by a water monster and they are saved by fish bowl head Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) who claims to be Quentin Beck from another Earth.It would have been great to have Gyllenhaal be Holland's replacement mentor. I don't mind the expected villain turn although he probably has a few too many henchmen. As for Zendaya's MJ, her deadpan delivery holds some interest but could be limiting in future sequels. The main question I have is whether this franchise needed an European Vacation already. Most of time, a franchise should be stale before trying to refresh itself with exotic locations. I wouldn't mind more high school and more Aunt May to let his world breathe. The reason for a younger Peter Parker actor is for him to live more fully in the high school experience. At this pace, he's getting a job at the newspaper in the next movie and that would be a shame. He should be having more high school soap opera before then.""]",Positive
"[""The Spiderman franchise seems to be the one that is bucking the trend with the films actually getting better each time. The dynamic between Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal in this is great and now that we don't have to pretend we don't know Spidey's identity, we can develop the character much more fully so the relationship with MJ is also taking better shape too. It's fast-moving, entertaining and the plot is fun. For a change, the CGI is complementary to the production rather than the sole reason for it. Good stuff, this!!""]",Positive
"[""It's the 1980's. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a privileged 27 year old Wall Street investment banker working for his father.

On top of his materialistic vapid daily existence, he has bloodthirsty nights that gets more and more out of control.Director Mary Harron is doing a slightly surreal horror slash comedy. The major problem is that I don't really care about anybody or anything in this movie. There are some witty moments like the business card oneupmanship scene. However I just couldn't bother with the annoying boorish selfish character. At some point, the movie started to bore me. He's not funny and the movie isn't really that funny either.

"['The film opens in London 1970 with Freddy working at Heathrow. In two hours it touches on the main aspects of his life, including his bisexuality and love for Mary (Lucy Boynton).

I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.Bravo. 10/10""]",Positive

"['Taylor Sheridan\'s ""Wind River"" is essentially two stories in one. The main plot is the murder investigated by Jeremy Renner\'s US Fish & Wildlife Service agent and Elizabeth Olsen\'s FBI agent. Since the murder has taken place on an Indian reservation - the Wind River Reservation referenced in the movie\'s title - the issue arises of whose responsibility it is to investigate. Renner and Olsen press forward with the investigation, and there\'s a lot to discover. The other plot is a focus on the status of people living on the reservation. The Indians are a minority in their own land, and are now relegated to dismal, isolated pieces of land with living conditions often comparable to the third world (not to mention high levels of alcoholism). Indeed, one of the movies addressed by the movie is the murders and disappearances of women on the reservations.I guess that my one complaint about the movie is Olsen\'s character. We get to learn about Renner\'s character\'s background, but not about hers. I would\'ve liked to hear more about why she chose the field that she did. Other than that, I found it to be a fine movie.

Accompanied by fellow squires Roland and Wat, William (now known as Sir Ulric) embarks on a career and love life, while making friends and enemies along the way.The minute the audience at the joust start clapping along with We Will Rock You, it becomes clear that A Knight's Tale is minded to cheerfully disregard any suggestion that it should be historically accurate. Indeed, it goes out of its way to pepper itself with anachronistic gags, both verbal and visual.Heath Ledger, doing an excellent English accent, delights as William, and Mark Addy and Alan Tudyk provide excellent support as his two fellow squires.

"['Well, I was pretty harsh in my reviews of ""Leon:The Professional"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" for different reasons, both by director Luc Besson. I find myself pretty much in the same position here. Not that this isn\'t a slick and stylish espionage thriller, but the action sequences defy all manner of credibility, making even John Wick a piker relative to body count when all the dust settles. I guess that\'s what one expects when going into a flick like this, but after a while it gets almost comical. The chronologically challenged time frames also don\'t help, and I can\'t say they were totally necessary to tell an effective story. What they provide are the unexpected twists involved in turning an assassin into a double agent, and then a triple agent, and I guess you could have gone on and on in that manner if the picture wanted to. There\'s also that slick use of a body double to mimic Anna (Sasha Luss) in some of the tighter spots she found herself in.

La femme Nikita is almost 30 years ago. He's like an old painter who keeps returning to the same style over and over again. He's trying something a little grittier and a little more real. It's not his lane. His lane is hot girl doing wild actions with simplistic story. He tries to add layers to the story. At last, he's no Graham Greene which brings to mind the acting skills of model-turned-actor Sasha Luss. She tries and the character is essentially her without the killings. She's surprisingly functional but she's no Meryl Streep. Finally, I would try to clean up the constant time-jumps in the plot. They are supposed to be shocking reveals but they mostly confuse and are unnecessary.

"['Just watched this movie with my movie theatre-working friend. When the premise is of a drug dealer being assigned to smuggle many pounds of the stuff across Mexico with a pretend family of a stripper and two homeless teens, no way was this going to get a rating lower than ""R"" especially when the ""siblings"" are a boy and girl and the boy ends up kissing both his ""sister"" and ""mother""! Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston provide plenty of laughs as the ""parental units"" along with much of the supporting cast of which includes another couple with a teen daughter of which the father is a law officer!

To save his own skin and get back in the good graces of his boss, David agrees to travel to Mexico and smuggle a major stash across the border. He rents an RV and gathers a fake family to use as his cover. His neighbor Rose(Jennifer Aniston), a stripper who just quit her job, is willing to pretend to be his wife...for a fee of course. Rounding out his ""new"" family will be Kenny(Will Poulter), a shy professed virgin and Casey(Emma Roberts), a street wise runaway. Now the family known as the Millers, on vacation, should make smuggling drugs a bit easier. Well guess again; the dealers in Mexico feel they have given a huge amount of drugs to the wrong person and are in hot pursuit. Along the way, the Millers will meet another RV of vacationers...a DEA agent and his family.Funny situations, pervasive language, drug content, crude sexual scenes with very brief nudity. Of course, my favorite sequence is when Rose must prove to drug dealers that she actually is a stripper. Well done, I must say. And young Mr. Poulter may just be accused of being the scene stealer. He is funny! The cast also includes: Nick Offerman, Tomer Sisley, Molly C. Quinn, Kathryn Hahn and Ed Helms.']",Positive

What transpires is Ralph Fiennes\' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth.

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this could have been an excellent superhero film if it had a more serious or coherent plot. Unfortunately, the director ""Martin Campbell"" apparently couldn\'t focus on what kind of movie he wanted and the result was one which had some rather bad CGI along with some heroes and villains who belonged more to a children\'s matinÃ©e than a prime-time movie.

Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!""]",Positive

Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.""]",Positive

They are shocked by their own doppelgangers wearing red overalls and armed with scissors.I like the comedy when they happen. The horror isn't that horrific but it is intriguing. What I love most about the horror is its unknowable premise. That it is unknowable until the movie tries to let us know it. It's actually a lot more creepy when these unknown doppelgangers appear out of nowhere without explanations. The problem starts with the opening text. The knowledge of tunnels is unnecessary. It's a piece of a puzzle which is better left unsolved. The present day story should really end after the news report on the TV. It can then go back to 1986 for that surprise reveal but it's not necessary to try to explain the world beneath. I do like the final twist but it doesn't need more than that. Jordan Peele has a pretty good concept but it's not as clever as he thinks it is. That's why the harder he attempts to explain, the less interesting it is.""]",Positive

It's a film that features oodles of gritty realism, along with graphic depictions of violence and the like, much like Denis Villeneuve's previous movie PRISONERS. The grand, epic-style action sequences that fuel SICARIO make it a superior film to that, although I still found it a little lacking.Despite the length of the film and the big speeches and the like, the story actually turns out to be very simplistic and little different from the story lines in an average low rent action flick. I'm no fan of Emily Blunt, aside from her role in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, and as in LOOPER she feels out of place here. Luckily you get veteran genre actors like Benicio Del Toro to balance things out a bit.

Simmons' Oscar-winning role does show quite the range of emotions concerning his wanting his students showing how much excellence-according to him-he wants to get from them. His recounting the story of Charlie Parker and of a former student who died-which he says happened one way but we find out later it was in a much different way-does humanize him in a way that one would feel for him. And Miles Teller is great as the one student who seems obsessed with this teacher in trying to achieve greatness. I also liked his scenes with Paul Reiser as his father. The one question one should probably ask is if the ends of the way the movie goes on justify the means that it achieved when it got there. So on that note, I highly recommend Whiplash.""]",Positive

"[""Just watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While I don't think this was one of the best movies of last year (True Grit and The King's Speech were more worthy to me), The Social Network was certainly quite an attention-grabber what with the speedy dialogue from Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher's going back and forth from the depositions to the actual-if a little fabricated-events that lead to those court scenes and the performances of Jesse Eisenberg as the co-founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Timberlake as that Napster founder who charms his way into being one of the investors. Another compelling performance was that of Andrew Garfield as the embittered co-founder of Facebook who ends up suing Zuckerberg because of the latter's betrayal.

I didn\'t know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the ""Facebook"" movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can\'t really answer that, but I\'m guessing he read the book, the main ""character"" of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don\'t know, but it\'s not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder.

So on one side, there's no denying the amount of work and effort that went into this effort. The energy level, costuming and lively presentation all make for a richly entertaining experience for those who enjoy this type of spectacle. On the other hand, retooling history with an agenda of diversity doesn't sit well with this viewer, so it was difficult to maintain any semblance of an attention span.

You know what you are getting yourself into when you sit down to watch the movie, and writers Jake Kasdan, Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg definitely deliver as expected.There is an abundance of fast-paced action, funny characters, witty banter and dialogue, as well as a very wholeheartedly entertainment value to the movie. It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" a six out of ten stars.']",Positive
"[""Recently, our deep in trouble mall brought back it's first video arcade in many years. Well, this movie upgraded it's cast from the first one, and it doesn't lose a thing versus the earlier film.

The plot is exactly the same as the first time around, another video game of Jumanji only with real people thrown into the game. If anything, the script is a solid item indeed and the cast brings it off.The film never gives a viewer much chance tro rest. There's action on top of action, just like the video game. If they make enough of these, there will come a day when a marathon of them will be playing, and playing and playing and maybe, just maybe the next game will rescue our ailing mall. A lot of malls are being turned into Senior Housing. Rushing in a good game of Jumanji could improve sales- at the Tom Brady Scooter store.Put your brain away and enjoy this action film.""]",Positive

His story goes off the rails a bit when he brings Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind to the USA - I have no idea how accurate the almost-affair is, followed by the consequences of anti-freak action, but all ends well as the Big Top is erected. Jackman and the rest of the cast look to be having a whale of a time, and understandably so, given the gusto with which the musical numbers are presented. There were times when the lyrics were hard to make out, especially early on, but the melodies were all catchy and hummable and the lyrics (when clearly heard) were inspirational. The dancing was never technically challenging in terms of intricate footwork but the musical numbers, without exception, were exhilarating and emotional.I gather the critics haven't given this an easy ride. Well, content-wise it is fairly standard fictional biopic stuff, but the musical numbers are the best I can recall for some time.""]",Positive

I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy.

"[""A character study of obsession and growing madness, this is a film which makes up for a dearth of action by incorporating lots of suspense and subtle increases in tension into the running time. It's an exercise in psychological creepiness, boasting a near-flawless performance from Robin Williams, whose acting is introverted and subdued this time, instead of the awful loud comic character we have grown accustomed to from his earlier career. In fact, this might well be the best film of his long career. Without Williams, I'm not sure the film would be so successful in what it sets out to do; indeed, I can't imagine anyone else essaying the part as well as he does here: lonely, balding, blond-haired and totally alienated from the rest of society, he's a man without a life, whose obsession with a 'normal' family leads to tragedy.The surprising thing is that many scenes are riveting, despite not a lot happening. Moments when Williams faces the disapproval of his boss (Gary Cole, in another wonderfully nasty and impassioned turn) are engrossing, whilst the hotel set-piece at the finale keeps you guessing for as long as possible. Not sure I'm totally in favour of the (anti) climax, but at least it does away with clichÃ© and presents things in a far more realistic light than we often see in the movies.

Then he discovers, through another customer\'s photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy\'s isolation in the world.

Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams\' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well.

When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world\'s best father, he goes ""Psycho"".Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams\' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples: Maya\'s pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to ""unite"" in the hotel room. Jake\'s perceptions about ""Sy"" are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent ""point-of-view"" shot of Williams\' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker. And, while ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is a great old movie, why not substitute one that compliments ""Sav-Mart"", like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""? ******* One Hour Photo (1/13/02) Mark Romanek ~ Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen']",Positive

Angel-faced Baby is hired as a driver for a series of bank heists by crime boss, Doc (Kevin Spacey).

He meets a pretty young waitress named Debora (Lily James), that is the girl of his dreams. A botched robbery sends him on the run and he is hunted by the cops and his criminal boss and cohorts.Plenty of car chases with demolishing accidents; mass shootings, with machine-gun carnage all set to the beat of Baby's soundtrack that features tunes by the likes of Sam & Dave, R.E.M., Focus, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Barbara Lewis, The Commodores, Queen, T.

When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso CuarÃ³n shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise.

He begins to battle wits with the villain, LeChifre, who is in the center of international finance. He is also a gambler who is managing to make one hundred percent on his investments, Bond has to use every manner of effort to confront the barriers placed before him, including winning at cards. I remember the asinine first Hollywood version of this book, which came in the wake of some of the best ""serious"" Bond films. It had comedians Peter Sellers and Woody Allen and more silliness than you could shake a stick at. One thing I noticed is that the card game played was poker. In the book and the original movie, he plays Baccarat. Of course, hardly any Americans understand this game. In the first film there is a dramatic moment when a card is turned over and Bond wins...to this day, I don\'t know why!']",Positive

Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers.

This is the 23 James Bond installment and third starring Daniel Craig, as that beloved cool and captivating super spy. Say too much, say too little; SKYFALL has a different feel for some reason. Everyone can find their own reason for dissing and hissing at this one. Bond is vulnerable and yet dynamic and again the man you can depend on. M16 comes under attack and so does the credibility of M(Judi Dench), as she must relocate the agency. Her past creeps in to haunt her and this new dilemma has her putting her only hope in 007 to uncover its origins. Bond will have the aid of agency field agent Eve(Naomi Harris)to challenge a new Chairman of Intelligence(Ralph Fiennes)and follow a treacherous trail of a mysterious madman(Javier Bardem). Explosion after explosion is typical, but having M playing a more active role is not. Somehow of course, the old saying proves true...there IS a reason for everything. I really found the use of ""Boom Boom"" by The Animals fitting. And you can\'t ignore the wonderful theme by Adele, that I feel will be memorable for a long time.

Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn\'t need anyone but himself.

(She reminded me very much of Catherine Zeta Jones in ""Mask of Zorro"", both in looks and in voice.) She is appropriately pretty and exotic, but there wasn\'t any real chemistry with 007.The evil one is Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene who is leading an illicit effort to corner the water supply in Bolivia, but when the movie was over neither my wife or I could explain what the story line was.

This is not another serial killer movie like the endless TV shows that populate modern networks. It may not even be about the central characters.

The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, ""The Conjuring"" builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it.

My favorite character is Ethan because he is so blunt and straight forward. There is no hiding his emotions and I laugh at almost every thing he says and does! Something that is so clever about this movie is that it is very emotional, so you can go from cracking up to crying in one scene.The only thing that really bothers me about this film is the ending.

There are the games themselves, which seem to have been heavily influenced or inspired by ""Battle Royale"". And then there is the political commentary on inequality -- whether this is a critique of Rome, America today or just this imaginary world is up to the viewer to decide.Jennifer Lawrence is great as usual, and it is nice to see Donald Sutherland in a small but important role.

Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth\'s ""Knock Knock"" is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino.

When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". If ""Knock Knock"" is any indication, Roth\'s own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.']",Positive

"[""This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.Overall, an inventive film and fun to watch once you get past the slow first part.""]",Positive
"['The second ""animated"" feature-length offering from Tim Burton (after 1993\'s THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas which he only produced and co-wrote) is a delight: jaunty, funny and macabre in equal doses with impeccable vocal characterizations by the usual coterie of Burton regulars (Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough) and a couple of welcome new inductions (Joanna Lumley, Emily Watson and Richard E. Grant).The musical numbers, courtesy of perennial Burton collaborator Danny Elfman, are quite sprightly and give a cheerful boost to the ostensibly grim goings-on. The story is the stuff of fairy-tales with the usual assortment of shady relatives, and villainous suitors, so what ultimately sticks in the mind is the quirky supporting characters, particularly the maggot\'s perfectly-etched Peter Lorre impersonation (Enn Reitley).Although, at this remove, I\'d say that I enjoyed THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas slightly more than CORPSE BRIDE, it doesn\'t lessen in any way the latter\'s remarkable technical achievements, its boundless inventiveness and undoubted entertainment value.']",Positive
"['There\'s a couple of things to say about Tim Burton\'s ""Corpse Bride"". It\'s an impressive achievement in stop-motion animation, and the voices fit the characters perfectly. But I\'d say that what\'s more important is what it says about the class structure in 1800s Europe. Set in an unidentified village - it could be anywhere in Europe, despite the English accents - there\'s an arranged marriage planned between the son of a nouveau riche couple and the daughter of cruel aristocrats. It turns out, after the son gets whisked away to the Land of the Dead, that this place is livelier than the ""alive"" place. There can be no doubt that the ""nice"" world of the aristocrats was a facade (it\'s worth noting that Johnny Depp also played James M. Barrie, whose ""Peter Pan"" constituted a rebellion against the world of the aristocrats).So I\'d say that\'s that movie\'s real strength. It has a creative plot, but the indictment of the aristocracy is the important thing. Along with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Alfred in the 1989-97 Batman movies) do a fine job with the voices. I recommend it.As for Burton\'s disliked 2012 adaptation of ""Dark Shadows"", I interpreted it as a look at the political situation in the early 1970s.']",Positive
"['Pleasant romantic comedy about a young man (Domhnall Gleeson) who is told by his father (Bill Nighy) on his 21st birthday that all the men in his family possess the ability to travel back in time. He proceeds to use this new gift repeatedly to help him fix mistakes in his life and to help him with his relationship with a pretty girl (Rachel McAdams). As a romantic comedy with some tearjerker moments, it\'s very enjoyable and nice. As science fiction, it will give you headaches with all the plot holes. So the more unforgiving sci-fi fans out there might want to skip this one. I didn\'t mind it much at first but it got more complicated as it went along. The plot itself is reminiscent of Groundhog Day and maybe a little bit of Somewhere in Time. Gleeson and McAdams both do very well and have great chemistry. McAdams is especially likable. Gleeson has an appealing ""young Hugh Grant"" quality about him. Bill Nighy steals the show from everybody, as is often the case. It\'s a good movie if you don\'t think too hard about it. But I must stress if you are someone who is a stickler for flaws in plots or someone who nitpicks time travel stories, you will really hate this. Everybody who doesn\'t fit that description should definitely check it out.']",Positive
"['This film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time. He embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriend.Though the main character is a guy, it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women. The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It\'s almost like ""The Notebook"" plus ""The Time Traveler\'s Wife"" combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there\'s much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don\'t make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it\'s a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn\'t the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it\'s still an enjoyable film.']",Positive

"[""GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fun and light-hearted superhero romp from Marvel. The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first, featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical, world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects, which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt, nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine, but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun, while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing, and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable, and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later, but the camaraderie is good-natured and, more importantly, funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum, and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel.""]",Positive

Here he can display his comedic potential more than in ""He\'s not that into you"". Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I\'ve seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don\'t watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don\'t know what\'s gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it\'s all for the sake of really good comedy.

It is difficult to put together a plot that involves intertwining present and future, and not to have any plot holes. Sandra Bullock\'s previous film, ""The Lake House"", was full of such plot holes. In contrast, the plot of ""Premonition"" is sound and has no plot holes. The present and future interacts with each other so that every piece of information has significance in the future. What\'s more important is that the outcome makes sense and not contradict each other. The initial confusion of Sandra Bullock is well presented, and I sympathise with her strange experience. The suspense is excellent and maintained throughout the movie. Things are revealed bit by bit, and finally everything falls into place. The ending is the best bit, but I will not reveal it. This film really captivated me, and I definitely recommend it!']",Positive

"['In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).

Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan\'s others. There\'s the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier\'s and Borden\'s rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla\'s (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It\'s both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge.

"['Let me start with: I don\'t like ""reality TV"" at all. And there is a reason you have to put """", because it is anything but real. And while this isn\'t real either (obviously), it is so much more fun than anything and feels more like what good reality TV could be ... if there where Vampires that is.The basics are clear. As is the fourth wall that is practically not existent, because we are in the middle of it all. Does it always make sense? Of course not, that is the nature of shows like that. How did the camera get in there beforehand? But at least the camera (or the guy holding it) get recognized a lot. The group of people behind this are popular, maybe not worldwide, before this movie came out, but at least ""at home"". And it shows, because of the chemistry they have. This is very well written and acted. Comedy timing is essential and in this case awesome.']",Positive
"[""After hearing so many good reports about this movie - and remembering that New Zealand has made some really funny offbeat comedies (like the early works of Peter Jackson) - I decided to give it a look. And for the most part, I am glad I gave it a chance. It is indeed very amusing at times. I think that the reason the movie is humorous is that it has a very warm viewpoint towards the characters. Yes, some of the acting is a little rough, but these characters come across as HUMAN despite being vampires. They have needs, they have weaknesses, and other attributes that we in the audience can identify with. You'll like them despite their blood sucking. Speaking of blood sucking, the gore and the special effects are quite good for what had to have been a really low budget.If there is a weakness to this movie, it is in the story department. I realize the movie is a mockumentary following the characters in a day by day format (or make that night by night!), but for the longest time the movie is pretty episodic. After a while, you'll wish for some plot to come in to challenge the characters and add in some real drama. This lack of plot I believe holds the movie back from being great. But there's still enough here to make for a very enjoyable viewing.""]",Positive
"[""Clever director David Fincher adapts Swede Stieg Larsson's novel, the first of a trilogy of chillers. A disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig), accepts a job writing a biography of a wealthy industrialist; but actually is hired to solve the mystery of the patriarch's niece's disappearance...40 years ago. Most of the family live scattered on a small island and very few speak to each other, if at all. Mikeal will need the aid of bi-sexual, tattooed, punk computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander(Rooney Mara). It is very hard to keep a good girl down and this job will require every talent she has. The journalist and hacker work outstandingly well together. Their investigation will involve looking at decades of business records and analyzing old photos. The pair will uncover massive corruption and family portrayals like you couldn't believe. Secrets die hard. Some scenery is high maintenance; and some of my favorite scenes involve snowy landscapes. The violence does not necessarily pack a punch; but the sex scenes leave very little to the imagination. You will be eager in waiting for the second and third installments. Rounding out the cast: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson and Geraldine James.""]",Positive
"[""David Fincher is able to recreate the first of the Swedish hit trilogy based on the novels. The style is similar with the Swedish original. It's got the cold blue tone, and the same desolate morality. It hasn't been transplanted to anywhere else. In fact, it's basically kept the whole thing intact with the exception of the actors. Daniel Craig is a Hollywood choice to be the journalist. Of course, he's 007. Sure he's hot. So when Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) sleeps with him, it is less about his personality and a little more about his James Bond body. But it's to be expected for a Hollywood remake. Rooney Mara is just not as intense as Noomi Rapace. Rooney is a skinny girly actress with some good acting skills. She has just enough to play the anger. But Noomi has more. The original Lisbeth was a true discovery.I hate to compare the two, but they are so close that they're begging to be compared. Overall I liked the Swedish one slightly more but just very slightly. Some of that probably is due to the fact that I saw that one first. David Fincher does a great job of recreating the original.""]",Positive

Brutality is understood to be the only choice when readying cadets for a war zone, but when teaching college students how to play jazz? Simmons won a well deserved Oscar for his performance.

"['This film is about how Clark Kent grew up on Earth, and how he battles with the evil General from Krypton to save the Earth.""Man of Steel"" completely blew me away. Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It\'s easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe\'s integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams\' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill\'s superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing.

The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching! I really liked the ending. I think the final scene could have been cut away for better pacing, but maybe for some it is necessary.']",Positive
"['There aren\'t many moments in the movie that aren\'t intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I\'m not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One\'s attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man\'s perseverance, exemplified by Glass\'s own words in my summary line above.']",Positive

Hardy also gave a fine performance that also got him an Oscar nomination though he lost to Mark Ryland in The Bridge of Spies. Anyway, the nature shots taking place in winter look rough most of the time, appropriately so, so to speak. Oh, and that sequence involving that bear looked really brutal, that's for sure!

I\'m not quite sure why it\'s been re-released onto the big screen late in 2020, but I\'m glad I made the effort. Ethan Hawke (""Ellison Oswalt"") made his name ten years earlier as an author who wrote a book ""Kentucky Blood"" which dealt with the murder of an entire family and uncovered evidence overlooked by the police - much to their chagrin! Ever since, though, he has never managed to replicate his success and so now, together with wife ""Tracy"" (Juliet Rylance) and their two kids, takes up residence in a bungalow that was previously owned by a family found hanged from the bough of a tree in their own garden. Now, I don\'t know about you - but that would probably have been my cue to skedaddle, but he perseveres and when he discovers some really intriguing home movies in the attic, then starts hearing things go bump in the night the mystery deepens as does his dependence on the whisky bottle. Scott Derrickson uses light and sound eerily well and manages to create a genuine and ascending sense of peril here; Hawke is on form and as we gradually see the pattern emerging - with the help of the seemingly dozy, but actually pretty savvy local deputy James Ransone - the film gathers quite a decent pace to it.

"[""Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder.

"['Knowing only that this movie was about an aspiring ballerina vying for a role in ""Swan Lake"", I wasn\'t prepared for a largely dark tale about said ballerina\'s severe issues with inferiority and the self mutilation that came from the challenge of competition. That theme was further reinforced by the dancer she replaced, Beth Macintyre (Winona Ryder), who virtually committed suicide, even if she didn\'t die walking out into the middle of city traffic. What a mess these people were. At virtually all times, the picture is an intense psychological thriller that eventually descends into horror when Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) succumbs to her delusions and her mind begins to slip away under the stress of performing. That she quite literally becomes the Black Swan of the title by committing suicide to achieve her career zenith makes for a stunning finale, and the cheers of the crowd may have just as well heralded Portman\'s Oscar Win for Best Actress among a respectable field at the 2011 Awards. For potential viewers, be aware of more than a share of shocking scenes, with one in particular approaching, if not actually achieving, a level of undisguised pornography.']",Positive

Nina feels threatened by the newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis), who can perfectly perform the Black Swan, and is stressed with the situation. When Nina has a nervous breakdown, she gets in contact with her dark side and has constant nightmarish daydreams.""Black Swan"" is a beautiful but predictable film of Darren Aronofsky, with a cinematography that gives a nightmarish environment to the story that is too dark for a drama and too dramatic for a horror movie. Natalie Portman has a great performance but her character is too naive and with lack of confidence for a New Yorker indicated to be the prima ballerina of a ballet company. The theme is a variation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with the case of split personality but the film does not justify the hype around it.

"[""It's 480 BC and the Greek city states are faced with a massive invading Persian army. The Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and a force of 300 men march to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae to face King Xerxes and his army. The cliff narrows to a small opening to negate Xerxes' numerical advantage. They would hold the pass until they are betrayed.This is all about director Zack Snyder's vision to adapt this Frank Miller graphic novel. It is a cinematic full screen representation of a comic book. He's taken the beauty and essence of a 2-dimensional artform onto the big screen. He has taken the successful 'Sin City' style to the next level.The story is fairly basic. It's a lot of machismo and lots of abs. Gerard Butler holds the movie together in a thankless job in this visual vortex. The dialog can be very stilted, but it fits the story well.""]",Positive
"['When the ambitious King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas\'s army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.The epic ""The 300 Spartans"" is a great tale of courage, heroism and idealism. This remake is more cartoonist and violent, with monsters and giants as if it were a video game. The Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro is unrecognizable in the role of the King Xerxes. I usually do not like remakes, but this one gives a different approach to the heroic King Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans that defended their country in 480 BC.

"['Frank Miller\'s graphic novel of ancient Greek battle becomes ""Matrix""-ized splatter-flick, though one with a bemused smirk and black blood (making it somewhat more tolerable than horror-themed slaughters with a high body count). Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta, facing a humiliating loss of freedom from neighboring Persia, whose massive army is mythical in its legion. Despite a mere 300 men under his leadership, and a warning from the Oracle that ""all Greece will fall"", Butler\'s Leonidas devises a plan to combat the Persian soldiers and their king, Xerxes (who has a God complex as well as a kinky bent). Despite the orgiastic violence (countless impalements, gorings, decapitations, and disembowlments) and the brawny six-packs on the men--nearly every one of them--the film isn\'t intrinsically charged (either sexually in the masochistic sense or vitally). The matte paintings and other elaborate effects never take on a life of their own, and the scenario doesn\'t sizzle. Instead, it\'s a fairly straight-forward war film, and many will see this as an attribute. The screenplay includes several good lines of sharp or jaded dialogue, and yet the macho brute force is one-note. The repetition eventually wears one down, and the picture has nowhere to go after the one-hour mark. ** from ****']",Positive
"['What a pure masterpiece here. A terrific, outstanding movie, so powerful. A head hit in the face, I can\'t explain better. All away from clichÃ©s, a billion miles from everything you have already seen about the subject, with the usual scheme of the good American authorities fighting against the evil cartels. Nothing of that here. It\'s not good vs evil scheme, but evil vs ""eviler"". That\'s all. Period. Benicio Del Torro will forever be for drug cartel films what John Wayne was for westerns. And Del Torro\'s character\'s name in this feature is Medellin.... One more thing. This settings could have been Afghanistan or Irak where Special Forces would have to fight against Muslims terrorists. But instead of that, this movie takes place in Mexico, near the US border, and the fight in question against drug cartels instead. The kind of action film, busted with testosterone, that won\'t be forgotten, and also which makes you think long after the viewing. A pure true masterpiece.']",Positive

These were perfectly done, absolutely flawless.

But there are here some missing sequences; such as this one, just after the armed robbery at the store where Washington works, a robbery where the Hood takes the female employee's ring. Washington let him go, runs to take a big hammer, and the scene after he brings the ring back without any explanation... You have here some short cuts as this one.

"[""19-year-old Jay Height (a fine and sympathetic performance by Maika Monroe) has sex with the mysterious Hugh (an effectively antsy portrayal by Jake Weary) in the back seat of his car. Unbeknownst to Jay, Hugh was being relentlessly stalked by a deadly and persistent carnal supernatural force that's now after her.Writer/director David Robert Mitchell relates the inspired and absorbing story at a hypnotically gradual pace, grounds the fantastic premise in a believably mundane everyday reality, ably crafts a potently unsettling sense of pure flesh-crawling dread and unease, and offers an original otherworldly demon which could very well represent a fatal sexually transmitted disease ala AIDS, the deep-seated fear and inevitability of death, and even the feelings of guilt and shame that the puritanical American culture ascribes to people engaging in intercourse for pleasurable purposes. Moreover, this film's strangely timeless quality adds immensely to its overall eerie and unnerving atmosphere while the fact that the demonic force moves slow, but never gives up and seems unstoppable ensures that this picture is guaranteed to really get under your skin. In addition, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Lili Sepe as Jay's concerned sister Kelly, Daniel Zovatto as the decent Greg Hannigan, Keir Gilchrist as smitten nerd Paul, and Olivia Luccardi as the gawky Yara. The crisp cinematography by Mike Gioulakis makes masterful use of the widescreen format. Rich Vreeland's shivery synthesizer score hits the pulsating shuddery spot. An on the money creepy and disquieting chiller.""]",Positive
"[""I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before. It felt a bit like that to me, though that does not necessarily apply to any other viewer of course.Give it a chance on Disc, if you haven't already watched it.""]",Positive

Andrew Garfield is the same age as Tobey Maguire when he started, but Andrew looks much older. It's hard to imagine him as a high school nerd. Andrew looks his age which is 27-28 whereas Tobey always looks like a kid. Andrew really looks like one of the cool art kids with a guitar. Emma Stone is great as the love interest. Rhys Ifans is the villain but the problem is his CG avatar. He's a lizard and doesn't have much personality.

"['The most important thing you might wanna know about this review is that I am certainly NOT in the target demographic group for this film. As a 53 year-old man, I am not the type to ever watch ""Pitch Perfect"" in the first place and did so only because my daughter insisted that it was a good film and I would enjoy it. And, fortunately, I did enjoy it quite a bit. Now I am NOT saying I think it\'s a great film, it certainly has its faults, but it is fun and entertaining.The film is about a capella singing....certainly not the sort of thing most of us enjoy or even care about...though the film manages to infuse the subject with enthusiasm. And, you\'ll soon find yourself moving along with the singing...and much of it is very infectious. And, the film is about most every stereotype I could think of when it comes to young adult films---you have the bossy and nasty leader of the group, the lesbian, the fat girl who is funny and the rest of the clichÃ©s (such as the final big number where not only do ALL the ladies know the lyrics BUT also the choreography of a song they NEVER practiced).

"[""You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan.

THE STRANGERS will have you drowning in anxiety and listening to your own blood chill. A young suburban couple Kristen(Liv Tyler)and James(Scott Speedman)need some peace and quiet and time to think as they arrive at a secluded family vacation home. You don't always get what you want. Rapping at the door becomes bagging on the door. Strangers staring at the house and peeking through writing on the windows. It is a living nightmare as three masked strangers invade the couple's privacy. It is amazing what you can bring yourself to do when survival is on the line. This is not the time to hear someone at the door or your cellphone to ring. It is so much fun to be terrified.""]",Positive
"['Apart from the ""based on true ..."" thing on the beginning, which by the way is my new big NO for a movie ... I just can\'t stand that hypocritical use of this phrase. Every other movie is than based on true events. Most of the romantic comedies are, teen comedies etc. etc. At least some parts are true or did happen in real life, which is why the script writer ""thought"" them up ...But I should stop ranting about that (and the fact, that a voice over at the beginning of the movie, isn\'t entirely ""correct"" ... well you see). This movie promises to scare you and it delivers. Mood-wise it stays close to a french movie called ""Ils"" (Them), which was a great suspense thriller/horror. I also liked the relationships between the two main characters. You could say it\'s standard fare, but it has great framing and lighting (sound design is ""scary"" too).']",Positive

It may be too ambitious but they really gave it their all. It's got a great style. Some may complain about changes from the graphic novel. That's always a failed argument for me. I do have some minor complaints about the ending but I'm not saying there are easy solutions. It oversimplifies world politics and distorts human nature. Malin Akerman does a good job despite the naysayers. Dr. Manhattan digs into some existential questions. I like everybody especially Jackie Earle Haley's performance.

"['If you have never heard of Aaron Sorkin you should seek out West Wing. One of the best TV shows produced ... EVER. Really great writing and smart plot combined. I didn\'t know he was responsible for the script for that movie, before I went in, but I should have seen that coming (or hear it in the dialogs).Of course before all that, was the idea of a movie about Facebook. Or the ""Facebook"" movie as it was also called. It seemed like a joke. Until you heard the director attached to the project. David Fincher! Now why would he want to do a movie about Facebook? I can\'t really answer that, but I\'m guessing he read the book, the main ""character"" of the movie wrote and he found something in it, he liked.Same must go for Sorkin. His fast paced dialog, might feel a bit distance for some. But for those who came to love it, they will really cherish every line spoken in the movie. If the real deal is as clever and eloquent as Eisenberg who is portraying him? Don\'t know, but it\'s not like everything is made as an ode to the Facebook Founder.

However, they also have an easy and likable chemistry as we saw in the Wedding Crashers, and this works well for them here. This is a gentle, likable comedy, where most of the characters are pleasant company, the chuckles are frequent and the smiles constant, the moral statements worth making and fairly subtly delivered, and the romance (Wilson and Rose Byrne) nicely played.By no means a classic, neither is it in any way offensive (apart from a single unwelcome F-bomb).

"[""I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.""]",Positive
"[""Director Christopher Nolan is rebooting the Dark Knight with a ever darker style. It is faux realism. He starts off with the death of Bruces' parents. After not able to kill their killer, Bruce is in a Chinese prison where he meets the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul. It is the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. His message is a dark perversion of Justice. When he returns to Gotham, he invents Batman.There are two things that keep this from an even more impressive start of Nolan's Batman Trilogy. The first is Katie Holmes. She is not up to the task. She is still playing that little girl character from Dawson's Creek. She doesn't have the seriousness or gravitas to play this gutsy lawyer character. It's a big character, and not just another girlfriend.The second is that Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) isn't a big enough villain. The evil plan has too much of a silly Bond feeling. It is too unrealistic in a Batman movie that is suppose to be realistic. It leaves a bad taste for the climatic ending. Other than those two, this is still a great start to the trilogy.

"['Writer-director Quentin Tarantino\'s ""8th film"", as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people\'s idea of a good time.

They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter\'s 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus ""The Thing"" (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott\'s ""Alien"" from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino\'s belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story\'s context, is welcomed), though the film\'s 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a ""Chapter Five"" prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson\'s excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we\'re snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone\'s ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****']",Positive

"[""My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better.

"['One thing that would be 100% guaranteed prior to the release of Jurassic World, is that whatever the quality, or lack of, the notices would be mixed. Thus the reactions would be akin to those that ""Indiana Jones 4"" received, charges of ruining childhoods and franchises etc.Jurassic World does exactly what is expected of it, it\'s a popcorn blockbuster that plays out as mindless fun, complete with outstanding effects, monster mayhem and moments of dumbness. In fact it\'s very much a safe sequel, reverting to the original formula without the classy edges of Spielberg\'s deft touch.There\'s a likable cast fronting up the pic, with Chris Pratt as the hero carrying some olde adventure chops about him, and Bryce Dallas Howard (her natural beauty sparkling on Blu-ray) a fun femme side-kick. The writers introduce a couple of new mighty monsters to the series, hell of beasties for sure, while the photography, stunt work and musical score all impress greatly.The Velociraptor plot line is crummy and daft, almost as daft as Bryce\'s high heels character arc, and the familiarity factor does grate a little at times, but it\'s a rollicking good time not to be taken remotely seriously like it\'s some sort of series disgrace. 7/10']",Positive

Though ""Jurassic World"" may not have the same effect, it still provides a very entertaining and thrilling experience. The dinosaurs are as real as ever, and their brutality is well portrayed.

"['Three hooligans are hired to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape. Once inside the first thing they see is the body of a dead man in the living room in front of several television screens. While two of them are searching the basement the other young man in the living room finds the tape in a VCR and plays it. He then watches several film segments of gruesome homicides which were recorded first-hand by the victim or perpetrator of these murders. Naturally, because these killings were taped by different people using their own individual video recorders the footage is extremely garbled and shaky. Obviously, this technique is done to give the appearance of a first-hand account of these killings similar in great measure to ""The Blair Witch Project"". However, the downside to this approach is that the overall quality of the movie typically suffers in the process. And so it is with this particular movie as well. Add in the fact that there was no coherent plot which managed to tie these unrelated murders together and the end result was something that made very little sense to me. Accordingly, I have to rate this movie as slightly below average.']",Positive

"[""A suburban family who are driving cross country run afoul of a savage mutant clan in the middle of a remote desert. Director Alexander Ahja, who also co-wrote the hard-hitting script with Gregory Levasseur, brings a fierce take-no-prisoners attitude to the harsh and gripping premise, makes fine use of the desolate desert wasteland location, generates plenty of tension, takes time to develop the characters, adeptly crafts a few eerie moments (the crater filled with abandoned automobiles and a ramshackle house that's littered with mannequins rate as especially striking and unsettling set pieces), and delivers a handy helping of unflinchingly graphic gore. The sound acting from the able cast further keeps this film on track: Aaron Stanford as the wimpy Doug, Kathleen Quinlan as the spunky Ethel, Vinessa Shaw as the sweet Lynn, Emilie de Ravin as the perky Brenda, Dan Byrd as the sullen Bobby, and Tom Bower as a grizzled gas station attendant. Moreover, the mutants are quite grotesque and frightening, with Billy Drago as vicious patriarch Papa Jupiter, Robert Joy as the brutish Lizard, and Michael Bailey Smith as hulking beast Pluto registering strongly as the definite scary stand-outs. The startling moments of go-for-the-throat unsparing violence pack a ferocious punch. Both Maxime Alexandre's sharp widescreen cinematography and the shivery score by tomandandy are up to speed.

Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters that shape his life.The casting deserves mention. Jena Malone as the sister (and narrator) was the wisest decision made on this film. Malone really needs to be in more films, and this was a shining moment for her. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, needs to be in fewer films, and it defies logic that she somehow beat others at audition.Vince Vaughn, Zach Galifianakis and a handful of others bring some star power to this (with all due respect to Emile Hirsch, he is not a household name). Their roles are small but effective. Great job. The Eddie Vedder soundtrack -- do we need two hours of Vedder? No. But we get it just the same.Although the film gets better as it goes (deeper ""in to the wild""), its popularity and high praise are something of a mystery.

Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this.

The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get ""unleashed"" is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride.

Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.']",Positive

Soon after he is pulled into the presence of a dying Green Lantern, who tells him ""the ring has chosen you."" When he is transported to the secret location, in a far corner of the universe, he is met with much skepticism. All the other green lanterns are from races much older than the human race, and they doubt that an Earthling human has what it takes. This of course provides the drama for Hal\'s quest to prove himself and become what our comic books refer to as the Green Lantern.A large obstacle is the evil monster of sorts that is absorbing the energy of others and in the process growing more powerful.

Eventually they all wrote letters to the Austrian lady, still alive, who had hidden Anne Frank, and raised enough money to have her fly to meet their class.The point of the movie is to show that in spite of the difficulties you happen to be in, you still have choices, and you can choose to accept others with differences, and choose a different path for your life.Good story, outstanding acting.']",Positive

"['This Disney effort is a delight from beginning to end. It is the story of a young princess who has a curse: anything she touches turns to ice. She can cause glaciers and formations to form just by the wave of a hand. When her parents die, she decides to completely isolate herself from her sister. They grow older on either side of a castle wall. When the castle is opened for the coronation, the younger sister, Anna becomes infatuated with a young prince and actually becomes engaged the same day. When Anna tells Elsa, she is furious and in the process she lets loose all her wintry power, running into the hills. The entire country is now frozen over and Anna\'s fiancÃ© is left in charge as she runs after her sister. So much has been written, so I won\'t retrace the ground already trod. If I could offer a layman\'s advice, it would be to focus more on the character of Elsa. She is the tormented soul who hides away, trying to deal with guilt and despair. She is certainly not unlike Simba in ""The Lion King"" trying to find some peace, trying to recover from intense guilt. The cast of peripheral characters are incredible. I found the snowman really wonderful as are the rock creatures who role in and take on the form of trolls. The music is wonderful (even though I can\'t escape some of the songs these days) and the dialogue and timing wonderful.']",Positive

The Charlestown neighborhood of Boston is known for turning out crafty armed robbers; generation after generation. Doug MacRay(Affleck)is a career bank robber planning his next hit. One of his crew is childhood friend Jim Coughlin(Jeremy Renner), who is quite volatile and obviously has a very short fuse. During the latest heist a bank manager Claire(Rebecca Hall)is kidnapped. Creating a major problem is the fact that Doug falls heavy for Claire thus causing doubts of judgment from mad dog Jim. That is not the worst; a head strong FBI agent(Jon Hamm)has MacCray and the recently fired bank manager under surveillance. Some very good car chases and gun battles.

He dates one of the victims in the robbery, while the FBI is on the hunt for him.""The Town"" is not a conventional action thriller, as it has an actual plot. So many action thriller nowadays involve mindless violence and senseless explosions, but ""The Town"" has none of these problems. It has well developed emotional elements in the background of action. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is well portrayed and developed. It is interesting to see how their relationship is tested when the truth comes out, and it is satisfying to see how their relationship end up to be in the end.I find the middle parts of the film a little slow, but the ending parts make up for it.

"[""OBLIVION is a great-looking addition to the wave of serious science fiction movies that have been filling cinema screens of late. It has wonderful vistas of a post-apocalyptic Earth, and although the screen is often full of CGI effects, they're handled very well and the overall result is a beautiful-looking movie.A shame, then, that all of the money and the visuals are wasted a little on a storyline that turns out to be rather clichÃ©d and predictable. OBLIVION takes a number of well known sci-fi tropes and mixes them all together in a somewhat unsatisfying mess; you know from the very outset the sort of thing that's going to happen here, and sure enough it does. It doesn't make for much in the way of entertainment, even if it is good spectacle.Tom Cruise stars in the usual everyman hero type role he's well known for, and he's not bad here; but none of the actors are required to do a great deal, which is a shame when there's genuine talent in the supporting cast. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets all of two lines, and Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko both look arresting but play rather one-dimensional characters. By the time you reach the second hour of this slow-moving production, all of what transpires will have been well telegraphed in advance, leaving this a somewhat hollow viewing experience.""]",Positive
"[""Kainan (Jim Caviezel) is an alien who crash lands on Earth bringing with him an animal called Moorwen of immense power.

The monster is revealed a little too early. They could have saved it for some place more powerful.Then there is the middle where the tension is almost all drained away. Kainan knows the creature is still out there, but he barely protests as the Vikings parties. It makes little sense. And Jim Caviezel isn't able to maintain any suspense there. It reveals one thing during the feast, but it's hardly worth the time wasted. I rather have more hunting action.The final hunt is a little muddled and too extended. After the big battle, it feels too repetitive. It seems anti-climatic to have the best action happen so much earlier. And the final blow isn't quite so great.

"['Having battled Nazis comically in ""Inglourious Basterds"", Brad Pitt now does so seriously in ""Fury"". He plays a staff sergeant commanding a Sherman tank through Nazi Germany. This movie shows World War II in its gritty details, although I admit that it probably doesn\'t compare to being in the midst of a battlefield. One of the most interesting scenes is when the platoon takes the town and spends some time with a pair of German women: it\'s a brief period of peaceful interaction between presumed enemies, just like the 1914 Christmas truce.It\'s a really good movie. There are some pretty intense battle scenes, but most importantly, the characters are people whom the audience can care about. In the end, I think that the countries that participated in World War I need to take a serious look at how the Versailles Negotiations precipitated World War II. In addition to the millions of lives senselessly lost in the WWI - not to mention the Armenian Genocide - the Versailles Negotations simply placed new colonizers in Africa and Asia, and destroyed Germany economically, setting the stage for Hitler\'s rise to power.Anyway, it\'s a movie that I recommend. Definitely see it.']",Positive

Jason Schwartzman is his young son, Ash. (Bill Murray voices the Badger and, perhaps not coincidentally, Murray and Schwartzman were the two principle actors in 'Rushmore'.)Other famous voices include Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean, Willem Dafoe as the menacing Rat, and my grandson's namesake, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip.But Mr Fox, and of course all the other animals, are wild animals. It is against their nature to go straight, and not steal chickens, geese, and apple cider from the farmers. So most of the movie pits the animals against the farmers. Mr Fox indeed turns out to be fantastic! The extras are interesting, especially as they relate to the animation used here, small puppets moved slightly between single frame shots.

"[""When I was in fifth grade a little over fifty years ago, I read a Weekly Reader article that stated that most great civilizations don't last much more than two hundred years.

I can't believe he actually watched it, but then again, benefit of the doubt and all that. It could be he was inspired by the way the picture satirizes the way the government operates today, what with a House of Representin that's about as effective as Congress these days.Well left to my own devices, this isn't the type of picture I would generally pick up, given the premise and the cast.

And, when I say \'little\' it\'s because the film was low-budgeted and seemed to come and go rather quickly. Fortunately, the DVD is available through Netflix and it\'s worth your time.Before going on, it\'s important to note that I am talking about ""The Final Girls""...not ""The Final Girl"" from 2010.The story is about a group of five friends who inexplicably get stuck in a bad 1980s slasher film.

Also, I am very fond of Adam DeVine and the Comedy-Horror meshups, i.e. The Cabin in the Woods, Scary Movie and Student Bodies. So this movie hit all the points.And boy, was it funny. So hilarious at times, I was laughing thoroughly out loud during many of the scenes.

It's perfect to do just that as you never know what to expect.But, suffice to say, if you are a slasher fan, 80s or not and you like a spoof without actually reducing itself just to comedy bits this is the perfect film for you.

"['Although Paul Feig\'s ""Bridesmaids"" is known as a chick flick, you have to accept the occasional crude humor to truly like it. I liked it. Melissa McCarthy\'s character is the really funny one, but Kristen Wiig certainly does some neat things, especially on the airplane. This is one of those movies that represents some of the best that comedy can be. It\'s true that there have been a ton of comedies centering on weddings, but this one knows how to time everything perfectly. It is, for lack of a better description, a very good movie, and you\'re sure to like it whether you\'re a man or a woman.And remember, be careful of food poisoning.']",Positive
"['A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given better material to work with.When Wiig and her ""Saturday Night Live"" fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph, are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder why someone didn\'t think to give these two a buddy comedy along the lines of ""Baby Mama."" But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig\'s character endures becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig\'s frantic efforts to wring comedy out of situations that don\'t lend themselves much to laughs.Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth sitting through.Grade: B']",Positive

"[""I liked this reworking of the Sleeping Beauty tale by Disney as they focus on Maleficent the malevolent fairy in Sleeping Beauty,Here Jolie's powerful fairy has been betrayed by a boyhood human friend and she curses the baby princess more out of anger and wanting revenge for the loss of her wings.However as the King for some reasons after the curse abandons the baby princess to three inept fairies its up to Maleficent to keep the baby safe from a distance which includes making sure she is fed.The screenplay and story is not without problems, in fact its heavily flawed and might perturb younger viewers. The parents give the child to the three fairies who are clueless in raising a baby and seem to be criminally negligent which ceases to be funny.The humans are shown to be power hungry out to destroy the fairy world with Sharlto Copley's King being an uneven villain himself. He betrays Maleficent for his desire for power and Copley's accent is a cross between South African, Nordic and Scots.Its a light film with great sets and costume design, a flawed fantasy with a strong performance from Angelina Jolie who lifts the film and makes it better than it has any right to be.""]",Positive

I think she also does a good job as the eponymous Maleficent where, coincidentally, an arguably finer actress than Jolie, Lesley Manville, is wasted in a joke role which is underwritten to boot. It's a nice take on The Sleeping Beauty though the song from the original Disney animated version, Once Upon A Dream may well be lost on younger viewers who were not going to movies in the early fifties - and while we're about it whose bright idea was it to drop Tchaikovsky's name as composer.

"[""Ratatouille is another highly enjoyable Pixar/Disney animated feature film that should do very well at the box office in its opening weekend. Having just said that, I must admit that the constant laughs I was expecting mainly seemed to come in fits and starts. Despite that, however, I found the story very enjoyable especially near the end when All is revealed. I found myself crying when that came so this movie definitely touched me on some level. Now that I think about it, I can't think of anything I would cut out or shorten so if the humor doesn't always flow smoothly, when the laughs come from me or the audience I feel they are deserved for the most part. Loved the scenes involving the old lady discovering the rats in her house and her attempts to shoot them all. Loved the constant weird movements involving the garbage-boy-turned-chef-with-a-rat-in-him that made the other staff look at him. And definitely loved the relationship between that garbage boy and the rat Remy and the way they cooperated together. Not to mention Remy's constant speaking to an image of his idol, Gusteau. So while not the funniest Pixar feature (The first Toy Story probably deserves that distinction), Ratatouille is certainly one of the most touching.

The score is resolutely haunting, the story is tightly paced and compelling, John Carpenter's direction is superb with some inspired, efficient techniques and while I have heard better the dialogue is good enough with some sharpness and nothing really that stands out as too cheesy or stilted.The acting is very good, and the characters especially Michael Myers are iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis is more than just a pretty face, her acting seems very genuine and she gives her character welcome gravitas. Donald Pleasance is excellent too, while Michael Myers as a character is the personification of terror.Halloween also works so well because of its atmosphere.

"[""Very loosely based on the book, which is very chilling and shocking, this is a great film. Having seen The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me and It and liking all three of them, I knew I should check out the Shining. I did feel that Jack Torrence's hallucinations, apparitions and time-warps were introduced a little too quickly and the build up to the ending was rushed too. But it is very stylishly filmed, making perfect use of an amazing set built at Elstree and a gliding Steadicam, and the music is atmospheric. The story is also effective, and there are really nice touches in the script. Kubrick here tries to be different, and I think he does a superb job at it. The Shining is more chilling rather than shocking, the blood flowing from the doors and the old woman in the bathtub made my hairs stand up on the back of my neck, and is constantly discomforting in an eerie sort of way. Jack Nicolson gives a barnstorming performance as Jack, a performance that is both hammy and disturbing, and Shelley Duvall does decently in a somewhat thankless role. Young Danny Lloyd is superb as Danny, his chanting of Redrum especially became increasingly hypnotic and distorted. The film concludes with a fairly suspenseful ending, and is overall a film with one or two problems and a very loose adaptation but it is a chilling adaptation with Kubrick succeeding at being different. 9/10 Bethany Cox""]",Positive

It was a bit much for me at times but it was like watching an event that you can't explain to another person. It sounds stupid to describe it and yet it has an unfathomable charm and a place in the movie musical canon. It was kind of cool to see it again, thirty years later.""]",Positive
"['The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla\'s best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various \'circumstances\' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his ""business"" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn\'t notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.']",Positive
"[""Youthful energy. That's what this is -- and what it is about.Spacek, King and Depalma are all at their most committed exuberance. Sometimes callow, but sometimes so rawly honest one often tingles quite apart from the story. See it on this basis alone. DePalma's  camera has a sense of dance -- Scorcese does too, but DePalma's is more emotional. Spacek is so clean in her acting that her ability frightens. How strange it went away, like a poltergism.The story has a haunting tone, also centered on youth and yearning. Menarche as a horror, the innocent acceptance/fear of the basest religion, the brash director intelligently spoofing Hitchcock. Odd mix that, so an odd and intriguing experience.""]",Positive

Everyone in the movie does a top-notch performance: Piper Laurie as Carrie\'s disturbed, fundamentalist Christian mother Margaret; Betty Buckley as gym teacher Ms. Collins, who befriends Carrie; William Katt as the clement Tommy Ross, taking Carrie to the prom; Nancy Allen as the despicable Chris Hargenson, wanting nothing except to brutalize Carrie; Amy Irving as the circumspect Sue Snell; and even a young John Travolta as Chris\' crony Billy Nolan.The most famous scene is of course the prom scene, where Chris and Billy go a little too far in their vile plans, leading Carrie to do something that no one will ever forget. And believe you me, you won\'t forget it either. You shouldn\'t forget it, because ""Carrie"" is one movie that everyone should see. 10/10.']",Positive

The plot is (intentionally) familiar, but the script isn\'t always so predictable, throwing the audience a curve-ball now and then. The jokes range from terrific to terrible, yet the cast and director/co-writer Mel Brooks almost always manage to keep the movie on track. Wilder teamed with Brooks on the screenplay, and there was a small feud about who did most of the work; consequently, they never did another picture together.

"['George Lazenby took on the mantle from Sean Connery for this ""007"" outing and I think he did quite a decent job with this, more convoluted story. He takes on the guise of an heraldry expert sent to Switzerland to investigate and validate the claims of lineage of Telly Savalas, purporting to be the ""Count de Beauchamps"" - defined by lack of ear lobes, don\'t you know - but who really has plans to use a form of hypnosis to achieve world domination. This film has a bit more class and less innuendo that it\'s earlier iterations - and Diana Rigg adds a bit of mischief and panache as the boisterous, independently-minded ""Tracy"" with whom poor old ""James"" has a pretty torrid time. This story isn\'t so good, but that isn\'t Lazenby\'s fault - indeed I felt that he, Rigg and Savalas tried hard to create a sense of suspense and menace; as did Ilse Steppat as the no-nonsense ""Irma Bunt"" (is that an anagram?).

"['Alright, let\'s just be boring and say that The Exorcist is still f***ing chilling to the bone. Shots that William Friedkin designed from paintings (like the shot of Max von Sydow\'s Father coming to the house in silhouette and seeing the lone light beaming out from the bedroom window), and taking from some ""based on a true story"" stuff from writer William Peter Blatty that the director shoots like a documentary is what sells it for me, for us, for the world. It could be said, argued, that after years of parodies like in the \'Scary Movie\' movies that the effect of seeing a little girl spewing green puke and rancid curses in the voice or 70 year old chain smoker Mercedes McCambridge isn\'t scary as it used to be.But the (surprising) fun of the Exorcist, and the dread, is that Friedkin doesn\'t back down from taking this seriously, and with an intensity that is unshakable. The acting is so naturalistic, yet still the actors giving screen performances (and it\'s people like Ellen Burstyn and von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb, you can\'t go wrong there), and there is a bit of mythology too â in maybe the only slightly over-long sequence at the beginning where the older Father goes about old ruins in Iraq to findÂ spooky thingsÂ as they say, the devil\'s in the details.

The effects are superb and have held up very well, and the sound is marvellous and adds to the many startling moments. The cinematography and scenery are also incredibly well done. The macabre, obscene demonstrations of manifest evil on display still startle even now, while William Friedkin's direction is one of his best and most intelligent of his career, not just making the scares genuine but also combining these with allegorical religious subtleties. The performances also lift, Linda Blair is really quite startling, and you couldn't have had more perfect support from Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn.

"['Aside from a couple of dull stretches, involving of all people, a surprisingly insipid Britt Ekland, this is both an exciting and amusing effort incorporating some great action sequences and a suspenseful, edge-of-the-seat climax which even tops the movie\'s exciting opening with Marc Lawrence. Admittedly, Bernard Lee\'s ""M"" is getting a bit too perfunctory, but the other characters are well played (although Richard Loo\'s voice is a bit odd â maybe it was dubbed). Christopher Lee has a really great time as the villain, and let\'s not forget the super-lovely Maud Adams. Fortunately, there\'s not so great an emphasis in this installment on crazy inventions and effects. Indeed, the approach to these standard Bond items is welcomely tongue-in-cheek. Instead, the movie concentrates on the exotic locations in Macau, Honk Kong and Siam, all of which are used as exciting backgrounds for some marvelous chases and action material. Admittedly, the scenes involving the American tourist are a bit heavy-handed but Ossie Morris\' sharp deep-focus location photography overcomes much â even the dull work of Ted Moore who obviously photographed the more routine studio interiors. Sets of course are a major asset, as usual, and the music score has plenty of zing. Production values are first-class. Admittedly, Hamilton\'s direction is no more than competent, but he knows when to give Morris and the location directors their heads â and that\'s the name of the game!']",Positive

Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi\'s Dracula and tell him off. ""There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing!"" Dracula says.

That great budget and no one can write an exciting story.

For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn\'t much of a plot here ... it\'s a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that.

A serial killer self-nicknamed ""The Zodiac"" is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who\'s employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper\'s reporting of (and the police department\'s concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith\'s non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it\'s quite riveting.

"['The Haunting of Blay Manor (2020) was recently released on Netflix and was the followup to The Haunting on Hill House (2018). The storyline focused on an American teacher and nanny who interviews and receives a nanny job in the English countryside of two children who have had a tragic life. As she moves in she starts seeing weird things happening all around her and the children. The series tells us the story of Bly House as the nanny experiences it and has subplots around the children and nanny\'s past. Mike Flanagan is the writer of Bly House. He also wrote The Haunting of Hill House and Gerald\'s Games for Netflix and he wrote the screenplay for Doctor Sleep as well. I think the concept for this series tried to take the family element that worked so well in Hill House, switch the concept from a family to a love story, and deliver a ""deep"" ghost story to wow audiences again...it didn\'t work. This was painful to get through. There were hardly any horror elements and this was really just a series of several love stories woven together. This was very disappointing. I may only give this series one more chance. If the next season is this bad we will take a serious hiatus from this franchise. I\'d give this a 3/10.']",Negative
"['The production and casting were superb. Immense care had gone into getting period details right, such as covering up the crosses in the churchyard (a Victorian innovation apparently). We were all therefore ready to suspend disbelief and enter Regency England once more.

Only quite small disturbances would have been needed to put the original plot off course. Instead, Miss Price charged about, constantly putting her foot in it, which I often found it too ""toe-curling"". If Tourette\'s syndrome had been recognised at that time, she might have been carted off to the local quack.However one should not take the series too seriously. It was amusing and made a fair attempt at answering the questions: what would it have been like to have been dropped into that period, and how would people of that time have reacted to someone with our views? The notable omission is that we could not have avoided the lower strata of society and there our 21st century senses and sensibilities would really have come to the boil.']",Negative

Sometimes they get it near perfect, here they were off by a whole lot. The story is basically taken from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with some Stephen King twists and perversions added to the mix, the book has the perversions, the movie takes all that kind of stuff out. In the end the movie is a dried husk of the book which was not particularly strong either. Jimmy Smits is awful in it, but then so is everyone else, and the fact it is a two parter and extended needlessly does not help matters out either. So all I can say is be prepared to see a lot of green light, a very toned down ending (granted I can see why they could not do the whole woman being naked at the end), and also be prepared for a very unmemorable ride. I would suggest reading the book instead, but it is not really all that worth finding either.']",Negative

"[""Now I like Quentin Tarantino's movies on the whole, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my favourites of his. But Inglorious Basterds, as much as I wanted to like it, is not among Tarantino's best.Granted it is very well made, with the cinematography and scenery amazing. Also the music is superb and Christolph Waltz is brilliant as the SS colonel being both charming and deliciously evil. Despite these high points, in my point of view it is just too uneven. Story-wise, it is essentially a series of vignettes and of variable quality too. There are some highlights such as the opening and the resistance-bar rendezvous, but there are some dull and bloated parts too unfortunately. The script has its fair share of wit but it is also some very stilted and ropey dialogue too. The characters come across as rather caricatured and clichÃ©d, and the other acting is so-so at best. I actually think Brad Pitt gives one of his weaker performances here I'm afraid to say. And I also don't think Tarantino's direction is innovative or authentic enough, while I didn't thinmk much of the ending.Overall it has its moments but these moments weren't enough as a whole.

"[""I am a big fan of Michael Crichton and I was very disappointed by this film. It is not the format - TV series and miniseries can do wonders in the science fiction genre - just take the examples of 'Earth 2' or 'Jericho' or even 'Dune' which had to compete with a David Lynch feature film. Here we are dealing with a bad treatment for one of the best novels in the history of the genre.Almost everything is wrong here. The first novel signed by Crichtonwith his own name gets an actualization where we see once again a TV president of the United States quite far from the charisma and power his position should have, we see villain generals plotting against the nation and the world with an unbelievable stupidity and a team of scientists that endlessly debate in cryptic techno-slang while never caring to make us feel for them, neither when they debate the fate of the planet, nor when they kiss, nor when they die. Effects are average minus, and it is only the basic skeleton of the Crichton story and the classic idea of his about mankind as the wizard apprentice that opens the Pandora box of science that gives the action some consistency and interest.

Certainly, the filmmakers responsible for THE WITCH have carefully crafted this flick with as much True Believer fervor and attention to detail as the people behind Mel Gibson\'s THE PASSION OF THE CHR!ST. No corners are cut in the pains-taking regard for period language, belief systems, and social fabric here. It\'s as if viewers have stumbled out of a Time Tunnel just as America is signing over her Soul to Baal.

"[""It's 17th century New England. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) lives with her family on an isolated farm. The local village banishes them for religious disagreements. Her parents are strict and God fearing. Her younger brother Caleb has lustful thoughts about her. Her younger twin siblings Mercy and Jonas are obsessed with the family black goat Black Phillip. Thomasin is playing with baby Samuel when he suddenly disappears. A witch in the woods has kidnapped and killed him. The farm is failing and the father is forced to hunt. Thomasin jokes by scaring Mercy about being a witch which comes back to haunt her. Caleb goes into the woods to gather food. Thomasin insists on joining him but it goes badly. Thomasin falls off the horse and Caleb is found in a sickly state.The movie gets really interesting around the midpoint. The first half feels slow and muddled. I had to watch the first half again to get a hold of the entire story. It's a matter of clarity and flow. After Samuel disappears, the family should be out of their minds searching the woods. Instead, the movie skips ahead a few day to them in a depressed state surrendered to the baby's fate. It's missing the emotional and plot connective tissues. The second half is much more intense paying off some story aspects. The lead girl Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. The brother and the father are also great. This is an intriguing psychological horror.""]",Negative

Speaking of which, the character Petyr (Ben Fransham) in this one is a pretty straight knockoff of Nosferatu from the 1922 silent film. To call it a parody might be somewhat of a misnomer, the picture skewers everything from vampires to zombies, werewolves and anything remotely resembling the undead, and does it in hilarious fashion. The thing is, the picture doesn\'t feel like it\'s trying to be a comedy, but the zany situations and clever writing make you laugh even if you don\'t want to.

"[""I wasn't expecting the remake to Nightmare on Elm Street to be as good as the classic original, but I was expecting a decent enough film. As a remake and on its own terms, this Nightmare on Elm Street is a mess. Is it the worst remake out there? Not quite, Psycho and Wicker Man were worse. But it is among the most pointless, at least to me. This time round, the story is over-simplistic, the characters shallow and dull and the script jumbled. And apart from one, the acting is terrible, especially from Kyle Gallner. The editing in general could've been tighter while the effects lack clarity and distract from the atmosphere rather than enhance it. Speaking of the atmosphere, it seemed bland here, the nail-biting suspense and build ups seem very subdued and I don't think I remember being shocked by any scene from this movie. The only redeeming quality I feel is the efforts of Jackie Earl Haley. Robert Englund's performance was iconic and wonderfully creepy so Haley had big shoes to fill, and while he is a little too small for the role his makeup is believable and he does make a valiant attempt with his characterisation.

Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded.

In addition, one of the most unforgivable things about CATCHING FIRE is that it has no ending at all, just a plot development that leads to the next in the series. It's a real cheat.""]",Negative

Not the same for the FX.The aliens are now almost all CG. That's a big problem since the original had some of the most iconic real FX.

I buy the jaguar as some kind of prophetic sign just like the solar eclipse. However, he doesn't need to rescue his wife and kid just in the nick of time.

When their small forest village is raided at night to capture women for slaves and men for sacrifices, Rudy hides his family in a deep pit and vows to return to save them. So that is really what the whole story is about, can Jaguar Paw escape and save his family?

What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups.

The idea that Benjamin starts out looking old, rejuvenates to the point of looking middle-aged, and ends up looking like a baby makes me think of something else. There\'s a certain period of his life where Benjamin can lead a normal existence, due to looking his age. Meanwhile, he has to spend both his youth and old age in nursing homes. He ends exactly as he started. Maybe the implication is that old age is, in a way, a return to childhood.As for the story itself, I guess that it didn\'t impress me as much as it could have, just since it seemed similar to ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The World According to Garp"", and also ""Youth without Youth"", about an elderly man who gets struck by lightning and starts aging backwards.Overall, I recommend the movie, although it\'s not one that I would have thought to nominate for Best Picture.

"['I think that the timing of the release of ""Megamind"" hurt it quite a bit. If you look at the revenue for this film, it really is not that impressive, as it cost nearly as much as it made. However, ""Despicable Me"", which came out shortly before ""Megamind"" made a ton of money--many times what it cost to make. Now this does not mean one film is necessarily better that the other. I really think that ""Despicable Me"" stole ""Megamind""\'s thunder and people were just not interested in seeing two films about an evil genius.So what\'s my verdict? Well, frankly I think both films are about equally good but have a slightly different audience. ""Despicable Me"" is clearly marketed more to kids and has cuteness as its advantage. The minions from ""Despicable Me"" are magnificent and adorable. It\'s also a tad formulaic--but not bad at all despite the predictability. ""Megamind"", however, is more a film for teens and adults--as cuteness is not really something I\'d associate with the movie. It also has a few more surprises and a more adult sense of humor. My wife and oldest daughter preferred ""Megamind"" while I preferred ""Despicable Me""--but we all agreed that both were really nice films.I could say a lot more about the film, but since it\'s now out on DVD and already has a ton of reviews, I\'ll pass. Suffice to say it\'s well worth seeing and is excellent entertainment.']",Negative
"[""To all shy freshman out there: You're certainly better off being introverted, especially after you see this rather odd film.Taken under the wing of two seniors in high school, our hero is a withdrawn young lad who craves for attention and is involved with his friend, better commonly known as his diary.This is certainly not your coming of age film. Dylan McDermott, as the father, and Ms. Cusack, who portrays the mother, have relatively little to do in the film.A wallflower would not have this kind of life. At least, our hero develops somewhat of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, though it is quite weird, which best describes the entire film.After the other two graduate and go off to college, our hero breaks down and we soon can guess what really happened to his aunt and what she had down to him.His course of therapy in the film is minimized.

Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit clichÃ©, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it).""]",Negative

Occasionally, though, Nicholson's crazed appearance and unmistakable mannerisms are perfect for his role, adding credibility and weight to his performance; such is the case with The Shining, in which the actor plays writer Jack Torrance, who, under the influence of evil spirits, slowly turns from family man to murderous axe-wielding nut-job.

But, the film is so thoroughly soaked in violence and human waste that the good is grossly overshadowed.

I end up thinking, I don't really give a damn if the two of them ever get together. Does anyone else care. The movie is lightweight, but it never takes itself seriously anyway. It's a series of really great songs and interactions, primarily among the hoodlum element of the fifties (who seem to be the standard bearers of that time, even though most kids weren't part of that culture). The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter).

"['You must have heard the raves...""the best Sequel of all time"", well, Star Wars Fans may disagree but it is a valid argument. This surpasses a Great Film with an even greater Film. It is certainly broader in Scope and even more lavish in its Production. The Flashback New York Scenes are a standout.The warm, rich Cinematography remain and the sharp Characters with a wider palette to add even more richness to proceedings. It is more edgy and is less likely to linger with Portrait like introductions to already known participants. There are more interesting themes here like the expansion to Las Vegas, and the formation of the Family\'s Patriarch and sensibilities, and the Senate Hearings.This one moves quite a bit faster than the original because it has much more to say. It says it and then some.

While the movie is old fashion, it is filmed expertly with energy. The first act has a lot of exposition work for the actors to get thru which does slow it down. The methodical miniaturization process is not quite thrilling enough. Once the sub goes into the body, the adventure begins. These are top notch special effects for its day. The designs are good.

Needless to say, what they thought might be a ten minute salvage operation turns out to be much more perilous and time consuming. Once inside the body, the story evolves in real time, so the suspense is heightened.Some nifty players do their best to make it all seem convincing and, on the whole, they do a creditable job.

Unfortunately, the story moves a little too slowly, a factor which modern audiences will probably find detrimental to this kind of tale.Summing up: May not be quite as satisfying for today's audiences who have seen everything in the way of science fiction, but in its time it was considered quite original and won Oscars for art decoration and special effects.""]",Negative

A giant lair, complete with monorail, hidden inside a volcano; a ninja army; Little Nellie, a stupid looking auto-gyro that proves unbeatable in an aerial battle against four regular helicopters; Bond posing as a Japanese fisherman: all a far cry from the rawness of the first two Connery movies (no surprise then that the screenplay was written by Roald Dahl, author of many a classic book for kids).As a fan of all things Japanese, I enjoy the setting, the karate, and the women, and Blofeld's piranha filled pool is a cool touch (every self-respecting megalomaniac should have one), but its not at all surprising that You Only Live Twice marked the end for Connery as Bond (at least for a while), the star being replaced by George Lazenby for the secret agent's next adventure.""]",Negative
"['Albert R. Broccoli sneaked into George Lucas\' backyard--outer space--with director Lewis Gilbert on the eleventh James Bond epic ""Moonraker,"" the absolutely most outlandish 007 thriller ever made. Basically, ""Moonraker"" was an overblown version of ""Goldfinger"" with an audacious battle sequence at the end with Space Marines storming a space station established by the ambitious villain. All Bond movies are essentially alike, being stitched together with episodes from other Bonds. Hugo Drax steals a space shuttle on loan to the United States from Britain and M dispatches 007 to investigate. The pre-credit sequence where Bond performs a free-fall without a parachute is one of the best in franchise. Later, when Bond is strapped into the gravity simulator, he emerges looking pretty wiped out. The scene is the most realistic of any Roger Moore Bond. The gondola scene in Venice is rather far out and goes over the top later when Bond\'s gondola becomes hovercraft. Jaws who had menaced Bond in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" returned but he was no longer a villain as he joined sides with 007. ""Moonraker"" ranks as one of John Barry\'s best orchestral scores, especially the bits during the theft of the space shuttle at the beginning. The riff on ""The Magnificent Seven"" in South America is cool as well as the monastery that serves as a training ground for spies. One of Q\'s coolest gadgets is the sleeping sombrero clad fellow who turns out to be shell concealing a machine gun. Lots of fun!']",Negative

Orson Welles has a few scenes as Le Chiffre, for example, but what happens to him is totally out of left field. Meanwhile, we get a storyline involving a past-his-prime David Niven as an elderly Bond who recruits various newcomers to the fold, including a poor Peter Sellers. An appears-in-anything Ursula Andress is the crumpet, while the supporting cast in this bloated production is packed with cameoing stars like Deborah Kerr, John Huston, William Holden, and even one Woody Allen playing \'Jimmy Bond\'.CASINO ROYALE has an episodic structure that is generally hard to watch as most of the supposed funny bits are anything but.

Who could the murderer be? The weirdo working as a handyman at the high school? The disfigured sex offender originally blamed for the girl's death? The dead girl's father (played by Leslie Nielsen) Or someone else? Seriously, it's not hard to figure out who killer is, so the film doesn't even work as a whodunit.

Yet, although it was certainly popular when it first came out, it seems to have lost its vitality since then.

Whereas ""Apocalypse Now"" directly condemned the US occupation of Vietnam, this one mainly focuses on the Americans getting killed there. Also, when it came out, there were complaints about how it portrayed the North Vietnamese: cruelly taking the Americans prisoner and making them play Russian Roulette.As long as one understands the approach that this movie is taking, then it\'s good.

The detective was our representative in the story, unravelling the order of the world. Noir turned that on its head, directly referencing what came before. The noir detective was still our avatar but was swept up in the world he was trying to understand. Everything happens TO him, not around him.Now Polanski does a Welles and Nicholson does a Brando.

"['This is an average film masquerading as great. I\'m not blaming Blake Edwards or the stars--after all, they were just making a picture. Instead, this movie is the ultimate ""personality cult"" picture. In other words, people are SO OVERWHELMED with Audrey Hepburn, they glomp onto a picture and act like it is one of the best pictures ever made. For movie poster collectors, they saw the value of posters from this little movie skyrocket to astronomical heights (it is currently one of the most valuable posters from the 1960s) due to the rise of this cult.The sad thing is that this isn\'t one of Ms. Hepburn\'s best pictures. Better films such as A Nun\'s Story, Love in the Afternoon or Sabrina are superior when compared side by side. My assumption is that those who fuel this cult probably never saw the movie or never saw her other films.By the way, even if I am way off in my attitude towards this film (since so many love it), you\'ve gotta admit that the movie deserves to lost a point or two because of the insane casting of Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi--a Japanese man!!!

There are people getting themselves into ridiculous situations because of their base stupidity. We have a helicopter attacked by a shark.

Putting Scheider through the same paces again in Amityville, with the John Williams music looming over the soundtrack whenever appropriate, is not enough. There are no new elements to the story of shark attacks--and, in fact, it all seems just as mechanical as the shark itself that is shown once too often.Some of the shark scenes are effective, particularly the opening scene with the divers and the one with the girl on water skis, but the moment the film hits dry land the story hits rock bottom and drags on and on until the next incident. The presence of a few familiar faces doesn't really help. Missing are Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw and the gripping story that made the first movie so terrific. As a replacement, we have some annoying teen-agers who've been warned not to go sailing just yet, one of whom is Scheider's son.As sequels go, this is barely fair...but the fright factor is not strong enough this time to prevent you from going into the water again.""]",Negative
"[""When I critique a film, I usually begin with a synopsis.

Not just because it doesn't tell a conventional narrative in a conventional way, although that's part of it. But more because what it shows doesn't please me. The images are unpleasant and unappealing. The main character doesn't invite me to identify with him. I don't understand what Lynch is trying to do, as a result of which I can't engage with the movie on any level except visual and, on that level, Lynch seems to have set out to ply me with a disturbing visual experience which I didn't enjoy.So I have to say that while I admire Lynch's ability to capture something which is, at best odd and, at worst, twisted, it wasn't really my thing.""]",Negative

Better still, the grim dream-like world presented herein proves to be so vivid, aberrant, and strangely convincing that once seen it's impossible to forget about.

"['A common theme in Alfred Hitchcock\'s movies was chaos: collapsing innocence in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", getting drug into a murder plot in ""Strangers on a Train"", the possible murder in ""Rear Window"", the shower scene in ""Psycho"", or the avians\' unexplained killing spree in ""The Birds"". But more specific than simply chaos, is getting falsely accused of something, as happens in ""North by Northwest"". Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an executive who gets mistaken for someone else. When he tries to avoid involvement, they set him up by murdering someone at the United Nations. Now he\'s on the run, and can trust only Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).Almost as famous as the crop-duster scene is the Mt. Rushmore scene. The way that one might interpret that scene is not what happens there, but what the monument itself represents. It shows past presidents, as if to represent the highest authority, as the UN scene might have been doing.Another interesting scene is the auction. If you look at how Eve is dressed and how she is seated, you notice that she is sort of like the colorful halfway point between two drab points, represented by two men (maybe that\'s just my interpretation). And of course Eva Marie Saint was one of Hitchcock\'s ""icy blondes"", much like Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren.Once again, Hitch proved himself to be a master director.']",Negative

"[""This film is supposedly based on the true account of a prisoner who escaped from Devil's Island in French Guiana. However, the book by Henri Charriere about his experiences apparently has a LOT of inconsistencies and outright fabrications (a polite way of saying he was a liar). So, provided you understand that this isn't quite a true story, this is still an exceptional film. Much of this is due to incredible acting, direction, scripting and makeup.Henri Charriere, played by Steve McQueen, is going to Devil's Island for killing a pimp--supposedly in self-defense. On the boat, he meets a swindler played by Dustin Hoffman and they become friends.Most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came--either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement. All take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners, by Charriere is resilient. Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt. In the end, Charriere does escape, though in real-life, this apparently did NOT occur.While there is a lot more to the movie and what I have mentioned (after all it's a very long and involved film), the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison. So, be prepared for a movie that at times is very difficult to watch but is constructed it's an amazing film.""]",Negative

"['\'El Topo\' is still one of the strangest movies ever made but Alejandro Jodorowsky amazingly managed to top himself with \'The Holy Mountain\'. This movie contains some of the most weird and wonderful scenes in the history of movies. It is filled with bizarre images which draw upon many religions and occult philosophies, and seems to be inspired equally by Bunuel and the comic book sci-fi surrealism of William Burroughs.  It\'s a cliche but when I say you have to see it to believe it I\'m not lying! The movie is roughly in three sections. The first documents the trials and tribulations of The Thief, a Christ figure. The second introduces The Alchemist (played by Jodorowsky himself) and his seven disciples who are each represented by a planet. The third sees all these odd people (and a chimpanzee) go on a pilgrimage to ""The Holy Mountain"". I found the third section to be much less interesting than the other two, and that, combined with the sensory overload of the earlier parts of the film, makes it not as successful as \'El Topo\' for me. But there\'s no denying that this is an extraordinary movie and anyone who appreciates strange and challenging films will find this to be the strangest and most challenging of all. Jodorowsky makes David Lynch look like Michael Bay! I can\'t truthfully say I get 90% of what he\'s getting at but boy, is it a trip trying to figure it out!']",Negative
"[""Like David Lynch's Lost Highway, The Holy Mountain is a film I'd be liable to recommend to a species of intelligence superior to man. This film is almost unclassifiable by human standards, except to call it a surrealist film, which is what we label anything that intentionally doesn't make sense. The film has a few neat sequences here and there, including a cute ending (even though it is a rushed one). What bothers me most about The Holy Mountain is that frankly it is in very bad taste. Its content is irreverent, and vulgar, and whatever the film is trying to say doesn't come out very well.The middle section I think is the best part. A number of individual sequences experimenting with allegory and art direction bode much better than the film as an entire hundred minute story. Art critics will probably look at The Holy Mountain, and be reminded of Hieronymous Bosh's Garden of Earthly Delights. Among other things both feature copious amounts of over saturated, unnatural colors and frontal nudity. The Holy Mountain can be plushy while at the same time kind of gross. The end result is a mildly interesting art movie, sometimes nice to look at, and yet it's also kind of repulsive, and not very smart. Might be of interest to art fans.""]",Negative

The not-so-Grim Reaper is of course planning to take the men to the afterlife, but the knight makes a most unusual deal: he and Death will play chess, and he will get to stay alive as long as he wins.Whether or not Antonius wins is not the point.

"['Ingmar Bergman\'s career of brooding cinematic successes was practically borne here, in an amazing study of doomsday travelers in 14th century Sweden confronting their mortality. In the age of the Black Plague, the streets are filled with pagans, drunks, artisans, performers, religious zealots and volunteer witch-burners; a knight and his squire, home from the Crusades, stop at the ocean, where a most benign Grim Reaper tells the knight he has been at his side for a long while. They engage in a winner-take-all game of chess, though the knight is just biding time to save the friends he has made from Death\'s clutches. The barbarism and cruelty aside, writer-director Bergman does show a streak of pithy black humor, resulting in some amazing sequences (such as the juggler cut down from a tree by Death and his scythe). The overlay of brutality in the name of Christianity, the torment of faith and the heavy symbolism are often tough to wade through, while the metaphor of the chess game has left the picture open for parody.

There's little more to it than that, and it's a decent template for thrills and action. The shoot-outs in this film are well directed and exciting, and the large scale climax approaches brilliance. However, the film does drag in places with the overlong running time. Angie Dickinson is an arresting presence for sure, but her romance scenes with Wayne feel unnecessary (not to mention unbelievable).

"[""Sly good ol' boy the Bandit (Burt Reynolds in peak amiable form) gets hired to haul 400 cases of beer from Texarkana to Atlanta in a mere 28 hours. Wily redneck trucker Cletus (a wonderfully spirited portrayal by Jerry Reed) helps the Bandit out while sweet runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field at her most adorable) tags along for the ride. Meanwhile, relentless and obsessive ramrod hick Sheriff Buford T. Justice (broadly played with lip-smacking brio by Jackie Gleason) gives hot pursuit. Director Hal Needham, working from a simple script by James Lee Barrett, Charles Shyer, and Alan Mandel, relates the entertainingly straightforward story at a constant swift pace, maintains an engaging good-natured tone throughout (although a lot of cars get wrecked, nobody ever gets seriously hurt), and milks the pleasantly irreverent humor for plenty of enormous belly laughs. Moreover, it's acted with real zest by an enthusiastic cast: Reynolds and Field display a strong and utterly charming natural chemistry, Gleason has a ball ad-libbing almost all of his hilariously profane dialogue, plus there are sound supporting contributions from Mike Henry as Justice's dim-witted son Junior, Pat McCormick as hearty blow-hard Big Enos, and Paul Williams as the sarcastic Little Enos. Bobby Byrne's sunny cinematography provides an attractive bright look. Further galvanized by a jaunty down-home score by Bill Justis, a first-rate rousing country soundtrack, and loads of well executed vehicular carnage, this affably unpretentious escapist fare sizes up as one immensely enjoyable romp.""]",Negative
"[""For the sake of this review I watched the entire movie, but I've got to say, it was a chore keeping my attention on the story. Criterion really dropped the ball on this one, they should have provided captioning for those of us who only speak English. I hardly understood a word spoken in the film, but I held out hope that the basic premise would reveal itself the way it has in other movies that I've had trouble following. No such luck. This thing started out way over the top and wound up just utterly stupid. I generally enjoy good parody but this seemed more like goofy slapstick. Could be I'm missing something because this gets a lot of credit by IMDb fans who's voting keep it in the Top #250. Maybe I'll try it again if I can find a copy with captioning, I'm open minded enough to give it another go.

"['Okay, after 250 comments what\'s left to say. Personally, I took the movie as a send-up of those god-awful biblical costume epics of the 1950\'s. One\'s like The Silver Chalice (1954) or David and Bathsheba (1951), et al. You know, the kind that gave you 90 minutes of sex and violence and then 10 minutes of redeeming religiosity spread on with a trowel. That way you could enjoy the fun stuff without guilt, and Hollywood could show it had gotten rid of all those Commie screenwriters of the 1940\'s.I don\'t know how they did it, but this is the most realistic looking Holy Land that I\'ve seenâ the parched countryside, the magnificent battlements, the ragged crowds, etc. The budget couldn\'t have been that big, but the settings are impressive in their realismânot what you\'d expect from a send-up like this.Anyway, it\'s a funny movie. And if it doesn\'t exactly end with the voice of God, it does end on a humorously ironic noteâall those crucifees hanging there, singing ""Look on the Bright Side of Life"". Beneath the black humor, there may well be real wisdom, and who\'s to say that this is not, in its own way, a voice from above.']",Negative

MICHAEL GOUGH is also very effective as the man who helps Cushing when he realizes the truth about vampires.Production values are first rate with the color photography able to create just as much dark atmosphere as the old B&W cobweb settings did.

"[""In those long ago, pre-video days, the only way I could get enough of this movie was multiple visits to the cinema.The long running TV series was good but, inevitably, diluted considerably in order to be piped into living rooms. But you had to make a choice to go and see the movie, and it is savage. Frank Burns and Margaret Houlihan, in particular, are drawn very differently here than the rather amiable buffoons portrayed in the TV series.The characters are somewhere they don't want to be, having to do things they don't want to do, and this gives rise to a laxity in behaviour none of them would consider in civilian life. The movie is necessarily episodic as the characters seek activities to keep their morale sufficiently high to make life bearable until they can finally return home.Everything about this film is brilliant, from the script and direction to all the performances. Sutherland and Gould were the headliners, of course, but everyone in this was excellent, and it's a shame that some of the careers which this film promised (Bud Cort, Jo Ann Pflug) never really materialised.Oh, and I'm not sure if I mentioned it, but it's very funny.""]",Negative
"['What made the spaghetti westerns different from John Wayne movies and such was that they showed the Old West as violent and gritty, and the people as dirty (the John Wayne movies portrayed the Old West as fancy and the people as good, clean Christians).

The plot of course has The Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood) arriving in a small town and playing two groups off against each other.Obviously, Sergio Leone\'s spaghetti westerns are the ones against which all others should be judged. This one not only had two sequels, but also paved the way for Leone directing ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Once Upon a Time in America"".

This doesn\'t go well with the police, and he is given two years on a chain gang.While Paul Newman\'s career was long and memorable, I think that ""Cool Hand Luke"" possibly ranks as his most memorable. Newman is something of an anti-hero, where we love him despite his faults and hope to see him escape from his captors, though we know full well that he is guilty of the crime for which he is interred.The most memorable scene? Of course, the egg-eating scene with fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Amazing (though far from any sort of record).

I\'m not entirely convinced, and won\'t be until I hear it from the creators, but it\'s an interesting theory.']",Negative
"['Heavy-handed western about eleven young boys becoming ""men"" while on rigorous cattle drive. Crude and violent, it\'s probably John Wayne\'s worst movie next to ""The Conqueror"". Bruce Dern, as another in his stable of wild-eyed villains, overdoes it once again, and in his last scene with Wayne vilified himself for years to come. The film, poorly directed by Mark Rydell, has no western nostalgia for the past, and no soul-searching for a future. It\'s all laid out in a bland, barren fashion, without anybody to care about and children one would cross the street in order to avoid. Wayne does his usual walk-through, but kids don\'t seem to be his thing (he\'s not much of a father-figure, more like a ornery distant relative).

What follows is a journey of discovery and a transformation of boys to men...Not your typical John Wayne movie. Wayne is less of the hero here, and more a paternal figure. After all, he was 65 years old when this movie was made, so his days of acting the invincible hero were behind him. However, for all the one-dimensional casting of him as a hero, here he shows a more balanced aspect to his acting. Interesting plot, with a dramatic, un-John Wayne-like twist near the end. Plot development, and some scenes, can be clumsy at times though.As mentioned, good performance from John Wayne. Good work from Bruce Dern, as the villain, plus all of the supporting cast, including the boys.']",Negative
