"'Everything about the latest James Bond flick, Casino Royale, is big and first-rate. Humongous action sequences, glorious scenery, a tense plot, a to-die-for Bond, incredibly beautiful women, and villains beyond evil. Daniel Craig is Bond, and when you get a look at his body, watch out. Not to mention those turquoise eyes. He\'s a tough Bond with less of a sense of humor and less relaxed than some previous 007s, but he fits the 21st century very well.This Casino Royale is far superior to the 1967 episodic film which had huge problems including actors who refused to be in the same room with one another during scenes, different writers writing dialogue for the same scene that didn\'t match, things like that. This version is an actual story, with Bond going after a financier of terrorists, Le Chiffre, in order to take all the money in a poker game. Things don\'t work out as planned; Bond is nearly killed right at the poker table, among other situations. And the terrorists want the money being gambled away - enough to kill and torture for it.That\'s quite a body count you\'ve been stacking up, M (Judi Dench) tells Bond. Indeed, he\'s taking people out right and left and acting like a renegade.Bond, with his loose sexuality and attitude toward women isn\'t exactly a modern hero. Here, with the excellent performance of Daniel Craig, he comes closer than he has in a while to being a Bond for this century.'"
"I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again."
"'Well actually the Marvel movies do seem to hit a quality standard, even when they change and bring new elements to it. New elements being the directors, in this case the one and only Waititi. If you haven\'t seen What we do in the shadows, I implore you to watch it. If you like dark and cynical humor that is. He really is good at directing but also acting (although his character here is animated so it\'s more of a voice acting job).Now the Marvel Universe has an overall arc, so it is tough to judge this without having the other movies in mind. I would say it works without any prior knowledge, but it\'s always better to know the other movies too. So the Universe is sort of an overlong season, although I think it\'s Phase 3 already if I\'m not mistaken. Whatever the case, this movie is funny, has action and is an (fantasy) escape for those who are looking out for one. Don\'t be hating, either enjoy it or let others enjoy it for what it is'"
"I've been working my way through the Marvel Cinematic Universe films lately and THOR: RAGNAROK marks a pleasing change from the norm (the last two I saw, BLACK PANTHER and SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING, were both average and I'd hoped for more). This is more like the tone of the original GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (and much better than the disappointing sequel), i.e. it manages to tell a good adventure story while being very funny and quirky at the same time.The expansive Thor mythology and backdrop has kicked up a gear, so that all of the characters return for a faster and funnier tale. I liked the idea of the prison planet ruled by a perfect Jeff Goldblum, and of course there's all the action you can hope for. However, the character beats are where this film really works: Chris Hemsworth has never been warmer, more human, or funnier, and Mark Ruffalo shines in a smaller role. Things build to the typical OTT climax which manages to work this time around by focusing on the individuals throughout, and the end result is one of the most likeable Marvel pictures yet. Bring on the next!"
"'Having a son who really loves these comic book movies stretches my appreciation for such presentations. We did watch the first one together years ago and it was decent. Since I\'m way past the time when I would have read a comic book featuring most of these characters, I treated it as a movie, only using what happened in the first one as a reference point. I have extensive knowledge of the classics and a long time interest in world mythology. You folks who are all bent out of shape that the mythology got screwed up in this movie need to realize that it is totally screwed up in the comic books. Except for excessive battle scenes which eventually seem to be the same old same old, I rather liked the humor and the plotting. I may even go and see the next one. I\'m hoping I don\'t have to keep saying to my adult son, Now, who is that guy? Oh, I did like the guy made out of rocks.'"
"'During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.This film was released over twenty years ago (I write this in January 2014) and still remains iconic and embedded in the consciousness of the American movie-goer. The attorney on the toilet, the cartoon DNA molecule, and Jeff Goldblum\'s career-defining role (even more so than The Fly)...I need to see this movie again to really get a handle on it critically, but how do you say anything bad about this picture? Special effects and CGI today cannot compete with what they had then... how have we gone backwards?'"

"Nutty John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has invited Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the company lawyer (Martin Ferrero) and his 2 grandkids to test out his Jurassic Park. Hammond has successfully cloned dinosaurs from the blood found in mosquitoes trapped in amber.It's a thrill ride using the state of the art CGI. The audience at the time would marvel at the realistic CG dinosaurs. It takes about an hour to set up and get to the exciting part. And Spielberg has more than just CGI to get the thrills. His mastery delivers one of the simplest and most iconic shot in the movie, the pulsing water. This and 'Schindler's List' would bookend his great year, and cement his greatest."
"Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.  The main addition of Ford's unicorn dreams opens up a whole new element to the film and throws up plenty to talk about once it is finished. A beautiful looking film that, thanks to this cut, has plenty of substance to match the visual flair."
"'There have been many movies about a future dystopia, but Blade Runner is truly one of the best. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a cop looking for renegade replicants - robots designed to look like humans - in 21st century Los Angeles. As he travels through the city, we get to see how it looks: it rains constantly, there\'s nothing but advertising everywhere, and everything is totally paved over. Grim yes, but not as grim as some of the experiences that Deckard has throughout the movie. Ridley Scott gives the movie a setting as grim as the one in Alien. You can\'t really say whether a person is supposed to feel cynical, fearful, or whatever while watching this movie, but it is definitely a movie that everyone should see.'"
"'Blade Runner is the kind of movie that leaves me with a million things to say and an inability to put anything down in writing. Quite simply, it\'s an engrossing film experience. In large part I think it\'s the mythology of the story that grabs me, the history of the Nexus Phase and how replicants virtually surpass humans in their abilities. My latest viewing was of the Director\'s Cut; it\'s been quite a while since I\'ve seen the original with Harrison Ford\'s narration, so comparisons don\'t come easy at this point. Even so, I\'ve been enthralled by the picture every time I\'ve seen it.Thinking about it today as I write this, we\'re only five years away from Ridley Scott\'s original vision set in Los Angeles of 2019. Robot technology seems to be in the news just about every day now, though nothing remotely approaches the wizardry of replicants, but who knows how far things will go. It\'s going to get pretty interesting.As for the picture, after each viewing it takes a few more days for it to completely leave my thoughts. One hopes that the future doesn\'t resolve to the type of dystopian darkness that films like this and the Terminator films manage to depict. The real world is scary enough as it is.'"
"'Titanic won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn\'t already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn\'t perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there\'s no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn\'t exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron\'s other huge success, Avatar. Well worth seeing once.'"
"John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a reformed assassin but his beloved who reformed him has died. After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie."
"SCHINDLER'S LIST is perhaps one of the ultimate anti-war movies in existence. Directed by Steven Spielberg in a naturalistic, unfussy style, it's a harsh, black and white epic that looks at the extermination of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis. Some humanity is brought to the fold by an excellent Liam Neeson who plays Oskar Schindler, a businessman who somehow found himself involved in the situation and who did the right thing. Like many Spielberg films, this is shamelessly sentimental, but then it can hope to be nothing else given the subject matter. The stirring music combines with the expert direction to make this an effortless watch, complemented by Ralph Fiennes whose role is the personification of evil."
"'maybe, not the best movie about Shoah. but the most useful. because it reminds the small details who are bricks of normality. and it does that in a wise manner. far to be one of fans of film, it seems be a real high good job. but it presents , in beautiful manner, a side of tragedy. a not large part of a phenomenon who shows its fruits but not its deep roots. a duty of Spielberg to his people, a remarkable photography and a touching story, it is a must see not for the story, artistic virtues, memorable scenes, splendid performances but for not ignore the evil. because it is not a film about Jews or a courageous man who saves innocent people , not about war but about the science to be yourself in dark periods. a film who must see. for reflection. for not ignore. the past. the vulnerability of society face to evil.'"
"To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.\nIts not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be."

"'A great follow up to the matrix, reloaded adds more awesome Kung-fu fight scenes and killer action. The cgi and fight coordination are so well done, and comparable to the first movie. The storyline is well developed and has a good flow. The acting is good from the whole cast and the characters themselves well developed.'"
"'The Matrix (1999) is still a great stand-alone film. That first film is THE ONE to see. The Matrix Reloaded, the first of the inevitable sequels, sucks all the awesome special effects it can muster, and coats the screen with them. The underdeveloped storyline, which helped make the original more mysterious and imaginative, is filled in enough babble to expose it as significantly less than satisfactory. The creative balance of action, effects, and imagination is lost. The three main actors (Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss) are upstaged by exciting new allies. So, what\'s left? - Although overwrought and onerous, the visual effects are STILL exciting, and the Matrix Universe isn\'t damaged beyond repair. Like they say, To Be ConcludedÂ ****** The Matrix Reloaded (2003) Larry & Andy Wachowski ~ Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne'"
"'Not a fan of the first movie, and this is even worse. The whole plot just seems like an excuse for several well-choreographed but dull fight scenes in slow motion, complete with impossible moves and such. Quite dull and pointless.'"
"I'm writing this for one purpose and one purpose only. I know it's fashionable to hammer Anne Hathaway for her portrayal. But what do people expect from her exactly? Do they want her to puRRR constantly? Do they really expect her to camp it up? That would run contrary to Christopher Nolan's vision. No, she played it to the level of Nolan's vision. She's not camping it up. She's not playing it big. She injects fragility into the character that is very much in keeping with this iteration of Batman. She injects much needed humanity into this character.As for the movie, I have the same problem as the other 2. Too much explaining. That's why Heath Ledger's Joker is still the best. He did things just because he's crazy. No more explanation needed."
"'When you look at the reviews for Arrival on IMDB, you might notice that there is a huge disparity among them. Many hate it, many love it...more so than most films. The reason, I think, is because this sci-fi film is very cerebral....and not a bit like Star Wars and more traditional science fiction.In this story, 12 enormous space craft suddenly appear all over the world. Not surprisingly, folks are scared and people want answers. Soon, a representative from the military shows up and requests that Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) join with a team of researchers in the American west....as they want her with her impressive linguistic skills to try to communicate with the vessel and the creatures within...if there are any. What follows is a long, slow and mend-bending film...one that is interesting and appears very realistic...but also is cerebral.The acting, special effects and all were very nice. I have no complaints about that at all. As for the story, I generally enjoyed it but felt that the whole concept of time being cyclical a bit strange....not bad, just odd. Overall, a good film but one that doubtless leaves many confused and bored.'"

"I saw the premise to this film and so looked forward to seeing it. The whole linguistics thing and the variance of time is intriguing. I just don't think it was explained very well. I've had coursework in linguistic theory and language. I was still trying to figure out what she was seeing. I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me. She is hurt be the death of her daughter so we throw in a metaphysical curve to explain the intentions of an alien race. So Einstein is alive and well, but we need something more than this. The final few minutes are just too much."
"I saw the very first Spider Man entry with Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and whilst I enjoyed it I wasn't so enamored to watch any others until this current release which attracted excellent reviews. From minute one it was obvious that a lot had gone on in those other Spider Mans because it was barely the same Peter Parker/Spider-Man I met all those years ago. For one thing a lot is made of an outfit called The Avengers, which seems to be a group of superheroes bent on saving the planet and of which Spider-Man is a member. Then he has a 'mentor' in the shape of Robert Downey jnr, a 'special' friend best described as a nerd and has a crush on a Black schoolmate, so much for the Kirsten Dunst character. It seems evident that the last two or three Spider-Man movies are not so much stand-alones as sequential so I can only comment on this entry as something I only partly 'got'. Having said that it was reasonably entertaining if not (to me) as compelling as the original."
"With this entry, Spider-Man is once again rebooted. No origin story this time which is as well since anyone knows how he came to be if they read the comics or at least Wikipedia. Tom Holland is suitably youngish being the high school student Peter Parker originally was and remained for a while during his creation. Nice splashes of humor throughout during even some of the more serious scenes. Awesome seeing Michael Keaton-former Batman portrayer-playing a main villain this time in a superhero movie. Oh, and yes, Stan Lee makes another of his cameos in a MCU movie! Also, there's a scene after the main closing credits and another one after the final end of them. In summary, Spider-Man: Homecoming is worth it to watch for die-hard fans!"
"GET OUT is a well-regarded modern-day American horror film that looks at race relations in an outlandish way. Styistically, it's similar to the likes of IT FOLLOWS, very well shot throughout and with an emphasis on the reactions of the actors involved rather than telling the story through flashy narration or fast editing. In terms of the story, I found it quite predictable, and it does seem to drag out the mystery endlessly at the outset when it's quite obvious what's going on. However, the ending certainly pays off and some finely-judged performances from the lead actors make this a satisfying viewing experience overall."

"Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been going out for about 5 months. They go to visit her affluent parents in the country. Her father (Bradley Whitford) insists that they're Obama supporters. Her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) hypnotizes Chris to stop his chain smoking. Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.This is a surprising project from comedian Jordan Peele. He's injecting a fresh take on the horror genre. It is tackling racism from a new perspective. It would be nice to have Chris and Rose in the regular world in the beginning to set a baseline with their black friends. As in most modern movies, the trailer gives away the movie. I feel that the twist would be more compelling otherwise. It's still a very effective horror satire of the modern world.***** spoilers *****The brain transplanting is problematic for me. Obviously, the flash brings back the hosts' minds but their brains are presumably scoped out. It makes no sense that they can come back from that. I assumed that the hypnotism had subjugated the hosts leaving them slaves to their commands. That would make more sense but I do understand Jordan Peele's attempt at subverting the liberal admiration. It isn't the obvious path and makes less logical sense."
"The first Spiderman film was good fun, and managed the rare feat of appealing to both comic book fans and just people who want n entertaining film with a good story when they go to the cinema.This third outing though is so bogged down by what has gone before that it takes a good hour before the plot really kicks in. I know there were plans for a 'Spiderman 4' with the same cast, but it does feel at times like the director is trying to tie up all the loose ends.Maguire and Dunst do well in their roles as ever, and what's nice is that various people who have appeared across the series return.It's a decent film, albeit one that like many sequels before it is trying to do far too much."
"I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, no new ideas, no originality, it felt like a B version of Wonder Woman.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears."
"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline."
"Spoilers herein.Here we have two of the most outrageous muggers of modern film: Pacino with full HooHaa and DeNiro dragging his biggest grimace.Obviously, this film was first conceived with the two facing each other at the diner, to be followed by a massive shootout. Give everyone women problems. Fill in the rest with some Mann repeats and heist mechanics. The result is incoherent, simply jelly to stick some episodes together.\nSome of these are tolerable -- any of the scenes with Diane Venora or Jon Voigt. Venora knows how to be outside and inside at the same time. Everything else is TeeVee hash.That's because Pacino and DeNiro have just given up trying. Their `method' is to find the character in themselves, which is NOT method acting, at least the Brando style. The problem is simply that these two actors are not interesting people, far less interesting than their characters might be.\nTed's evaluation: 1 of 4 -- You can find something better to do with your time."
"'John McClane (Bruce Willis), officer of the NYPD, tries to save wife Holly Gennaro and several others, taken hostage by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.This was the debut of Alan Rickman, the film that cemented Bruce Willis\' career as an action star, and possibly the greatest action of film of all time (or at the very least, the 1980s). While it could have become dated, it has not -- not in the slightest.As I write this (December 2013), there is a new Red Dawn where the Soviets were replaced with North Koreans. The original is now a time capsule. Die Hard remains timeless because the terrorists were European and not tied to any particular ideology or movement. This was a wise decision.'"
"The world has a new hero. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is a NYPD officer who's come to LA to reconcile with his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). They're at her employer's Christmas party when the building is taken over by German terrorist Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).John McClane isn't your regular 80s muscle bound superhuman hero. He's the everyman. He bleeds. He suffers. He wisecracks. He can talk in full sentences. He uses his brain as much as his muscles. He's just in the wrong place at the wrong time.The action is big and grandiose. It takes the adage that bigger is better to its limits. Unlike Schwarzenegger and Stallone, the action seems bigger and crazier. Explosions roll off the backs of those muscle heads, but John McClane really suffers. That's the trick."
"'Steven Spielberg\'s Saving Private Ryan is one of Spielberg\'s greatest masterpieces and I loved it.  It affected me like no other war film since Apocalypse Now which is saying something.  Spielberg always makes great war films, and this is his best yet (he also won his second Oscar for his direction).  With violent (yet necessary) war sequences (photographed by Oscar winner Kaminski) and some better than average acting by Tom Hanks and a great cast, this film will make you think twice about World War 2.  The Best Film of 1998.'"
"'After discovering that three of his brothers have been killed in battle, the War Department orders a group of soldiers to save Private Ryan and send him home to his mother. This act creates a fair amount of conflict, and from there the story really picks up.Steven Spielberg, while a fine director, often becomes sentimental and smarmy. This is no exception. But for the most part, the battles are fierce, the wounds are bloody and the death toll is high. Considered by many to be the greatest of all war films, it easily ranks up there in my book.What I loved most about this film? The casting of Nathan Fillion and Jeremy Davies. Oh my, I can never get enough of those two gentlemen. Beyond that, the realism and the brutality shines through. I appreciate that the Americans executed surrendering Germans (and on one occasion, Czechs) rather than took them prisoner. Is it right? No. But it\'s realistic.'"

"'It\'s so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: The Great Race and It\'s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. What transpires is Ralph Fiennes\' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth. One reviewer talked about it not making any money. If that\'s the case it means that a whole bunch of viewers have passed up a gem.'"
"'If you are about to watch a Wes Anderson movie, you should know what you are letting yourself into. The quirky, offbeat, weird and somewhat unpredictable nature of his movies, will either be a draw or a setback. Depending on what your viewing behavior is, you\'ll either enjoy the really out there feeling of this or you won\'t. Normally I\'d think I\'m not telling you anything new, but then again, you just might not have seen any of his movies (yet).The cast is more than stellar, even in the smaller roles inhabited here. And it\'s not so much about the story, than it is about things happening. While this also tends to have a violent side to it, it\'s the dialog that will hopefully entice you and keep the tension high. If you\'re not sure watch the trailer, if it is appealing watch, otherwise don\'t waste your time'"
"'Wes Anderson\'s films are really hard to describe or define. Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. This uniqueness is what makes The Grand Budapest Hotel worth seeing. It\'s an odd story where a story is told within a story--and it\'s filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. And, like Anderson\'s other films, it\'s full of odd characters, unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly, it\'s NOTHING like other films by other directors.The bottom line is that all these weird factors work together to make a film that you\'ll probably enjoy--but, like me, you won\'t be exactly sure why!'"
"Ridiculous movie with one basic thing going for it: The plot is so off the wall that it actually becomes funnier as the picture goes on.Three guys take their friend for a weekend in Las Vegas from California. The guy is supposed to get married. When the groom-to-be's brother-in-law, who is totally off-the wall, drugs the other guys, the film goes into an odyssey of what the 3 guys go through trying to find their lost friend. We see them interacting with drug dealers, playing 21 at the gambling tables, meeting up with Mike Tyson and his tiger and all other forms of ridiculous adventures. Yet, believe it or not, the film is humorous.Bradley Cooper steals the show as Phil, the California teacher, who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist, the zany groom's intended brother-in-law and our intended groom, the latter who has gone missing through most of the film.It's rare that a zany comedy works now, but this film actually does."
'I like the bit where all those funny events occurred'
"'What can you say about this movie, that hasn\'t been said before? Not much, but I state my opinion nonetheless :o).It is undeniably an action classic, although some people will find it (too) slow moving. So if you\'re more the fast paced action movie viewer, there\'s a chance that you won\'t quite enjoy this movie that much.Apart from the well staged action scenes (and the much talked about on-screen meeting of Pacino and De Niro), the supporting cast has to be mentioned. Not only Val Kilmer (who hadn\'t been that good in a movie since Doc H. in Tombstone and since then might only have achieved a likewise performance in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, though comedic and overshadowed by Robert Downey Jr), but every single one. Be it Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight to name a few ...The great film about the movie then (for me) is not the action parts (can\'t say I don\'t enjoy them! ;o) ), but the acting in the movie. Nobody is overplaying his/her part.So great acting+good story+well executed(directed)=Classic (imo)'"
"The Hangover is a great example of what the former frat boys from Animal House do the rest of their lives. Just simply more of the same.I have no doubt that these four would have been members in good standing right along with Blutarsky, Otter, and the rest. Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha decide on the way to Bartha's wedding in Los Angeles to have the ultimate in bachelor parties with a night in the sin city of the west, Las Vegas.It was one hell of a party, somebody slipped our merry men the date rape drug and they have absolutely no idea where they've been or what they've done. Worse than that they've got a baby in a closet and a tiger in the loo. But even worse than that, Bartha's been misplaced and they haven't the foggiest idea where to start looking for him.If you're taste runs to Animal House and Police Academy like comedies than The Hangover is definitely your cup of tea."
"There isn't anyone in this movie that I would ever say I wanted to see in a movie. The entire cast is completely unknown, so I can't have any preconceptions.Of course, it did get a lot of Teen Choice nominations, which would make it a movie I wouldn't go near except it may possibly make it on the expanded Best Picture list next year, so I have to sorta watch it.The funniest parts of the movie were the supporting cast: the wedding chapel manager, the cops (Ken Jeong & Cleo King), the doctor (Matt Walsh), the naked Japanese guy, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the tiger. There was not one funny moment involving the main characters except for the escape in the cop car."
"'The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book\'s hero from my childhood. The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi\'s movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): O Espetacular Homem-Aranha (The Spectacular Spider- Man)'"
"Spoilers herein.I'm very easy to please when it comes to stuff like this, especially if it successfully and visually builds a world of mood. I give special consideration to first-time competence, and am especially interested in projects Barrymore sponsors. I love time folding, self-reference and narrative challenges. I really enjoy films whose narrative depends on other films, ideally classics.And yet this film failed me, because of reliance on two devices that really annoy. The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism. I gladly swallowed it in 'American Beauty,' more eagerly in 'Fight Club,' and reluctantly with 'Magnolia.' But here, it is so heavihanded only a teenager could not think it unsophisticated. And this in a film quoting Graham Greene!"
"An extremely complex structure/movie, that might be too much for some people. Too much information, a too confusing plot line, not enough action, too slow a pace. All things that could be said about this movie. But it's still gripping. Even if you don't get what it means, after watching it the first time (I didn't), it still is a mesmerizing experience.In a time-line that doesn't seem clear, in a world that looks like ours, but feels entirely different, this movie gets its strength from the plot, which as well can be it's weak point for many. If you're not appalled to the strange, feel free to experience this movie ..."
"'Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a paranoid schizophrenic anti-social teenager having therapy with Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross) and using medication. He has visions of a giant rabbit, Frank, the Fuzzy Bunny, who instructs him to make violent acts, like destroying the fire hydrant and piping to flood his high-school like in Graham Greene\'s book, which text was read in his English class, or burning to the ground the house of the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Donnie is not at home when an engine turbine falls of a plane into his bedroom without any explanation. He predicts the doomsday and is very interested in time travel through the wormhole.Donnie Darko is one of the weirdest cult movies ever. Richard Kelly follows the same school of David Lynch, making a very intriguing movie with the usual elements of this director, such as in The Lost Highway, using characters very bizarre and dark. The story is confusing and quite nonsense but holds the attention until the very end, with great cast and performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Donnie DarkoNote: On 16 November 2014, I saw this movie again.'"
"'The bottom line is that the first two films engaged us on the sheer visual invention of the magical world. The third film was a good film as a film, architectural, Sculpted rhythm that matched the physical spaces shown.This one fails on both accounts. Oh, you will read that it attempts too much, coming of age meets thriller and so on. But I think it was simply a matter of not having a creative team in place that cared to make a good movie.There was only one cool effect: the seven Pegasii. And there was only one interesting character, Moaning Myrtle. Just one. So on the superficial level, the comment is that the basic film-making skills were absent.But wait! This is the guy behind Pushing Tin and Enchanted April, both supremely well done.So it must have been the producers that made this bloodless, a walk through the required scenes.So very strange, because the last one was all about rich film-making, It had a center, following the Orson Welles tradition that anchored the thing in the buildings. Why goof with expertise?Ted\'s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.'"
"'When I agreed to watch this Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film with my movie theatre working friend today, the Skip It reviews of Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott were still on my mind but since I\'d like to make up my own mind about anything, I thought, What the Hell. I\'ll admit also up front that while I almost fell asleep sometimes during this, by the time of the Big Revelation, I was wide awake and wanting to learn more. Also, despite my almost sleepy demeanor, I was enthralled by DiCaprio\'s lead performance, by Scorsese\'s direction, as well as fine supporting performances by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Michelle Williams. Nothing much more to say except this was another very compelling opus by the great director and his frequent leading man that I highly recommend.'"
"'So the whole damn Harry Potter thing finally ends, only to leave me wondering: if Professor McGonagall could shoot fire out of her wand and muster up a whole army of suited knights all along, why didn\'t she do it a whole hell of a lot sooner? And there lies my problem with the entire movie series. If you didn\'t read the books, which I didn\'t, you don\'t understand the story\'s logic half the time. Apparently it\'s all well explained by J.K. Rowling, but if so, the filmmakers did a bad job of transferring her explanations to the screen.All of the movies suffer from laziness, and Deathly Hallows Part 2, while much better, almost by default, than Deathly Hallows Part 1, is no exception. It assumes that the series\' die-hard fans will fill in the blanks the filmmakers are too bored to fill in for us, so key moments, like the standoff between McGonagall and Snape, or the one between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange, just sit there on the screen instead of causing us to leap to our feet in excitement.Let\'s just say I\'m looking forward to reading the books with my sons when they\'re old enough. Maybe then the whole story will make more sense.Grade: B'"
"'So, the series comes to an end, with Harry and his friends in the big showdown with Voldemort. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 continues the style that the series began to adopt in part 5, as a look at resistance to totalitarianism: you may recall that the Death Eaters aim to purify the wizarding world by eliminating anyone whom they don\'t consider a real wizard.Obviously, the movie can\'t really compare to the book, but I still found it to be a good conclusion to the series. It was always good to see that, as with the books, each successive movie got more mature and complex. Therefore, I recommend it, even if it isn\'t the ultimate masterpiece.'"
'Great movie. Star studded cast. Brilliant story line with a delightful twist at the end'
"'This is the final Harry Potter film, where Harry Potter and the gang destroys the remaining horcruxes and battles with Voldemont.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 signifies the end of a decade of Harry Potter films. Fortunately, it is a great film, ending the series on a high note. The pacing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fast, meaning action happens almost non-stop. Watching Harry Potter and the other wizards in Hogwarts in dire danger from Voldemont is very engaging. The special effects are very smooth and realistic, and one can only be marvelled by the complexity of the special effects in the battle scene. The only complaint I have is the underwhelming 3D effects. In most scene the 3D is barely noticeable, and there is only one scene involving fragments scattering in the sky that the 3D is spectacular. So watch the 2D version to save money.'"
"The series ends, at last. Good riddance. (Until JK Rowling needs money, I guess).The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.The second used that template and provides another plot. The plot was fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it was ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.This is all said, there was a momentum that kept it going. There were some new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it marginally likable.By the third, however, it was a tired formula. From then on it was all about gouging more money from kids and nerds.Rating for this last one should be lower, but it gets a bonus point for finally ending this seemingly-never-ending, sequels-for-the-sake-of-more-money series."
"'high technology. imaginative director. tasteful cocktail of myths, ecology and defense of basic values of human kind. against every critic, it is an amazing show. seductive, touching, maybe not profound but convincing. it is easy to blame it and it is easy to proclaim it as masterpiece. if you ignore its purpose. because the film has the admirable virtue to propose new measure unit in cinematography. than - to give the best image to a lot of problems of every day news. not the least, to give a challenge. to public, critics and cultural media . and that fact is the only important. because, fan or enemy of Cameron vision, it remains not easy to ignore. because it represents a new mythology, inspired mixture of elements from Sci Fi and old fairy tales.the only problem - maybe Sam Wortihington. but, in few decades, each error becomes a virtue.'"
"'This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don\'t like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God\'s sake. This is full of spectacle, humanity, and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I\'m surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren\'t complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren\'t as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.'"
"When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5."
"What a performance or better performances. It was about the time JK Simmons got recognized (read won an award)! And it couldn't have been a more rewarding role than this. If you are used to your typical musician against all odds film, be aware that this is anything but this blueprint you are used to.We're talking about a power performance (no pun intended) that has been already spoofed a lot, only to show the love for the passion this project had. It is so draining watching some of the stuff, you can only begin to imagine how stressful it must have been for those involved. There is not much light in this, but there doesn't need to be - it's perfect just the way it is (or is it?)"
"YES! A sequel that was actually better than the first installment. Now that's how you follow up a movie.Now, to be perfectly honest, I actually didn't even like the first Deadpool. I think I just wasn't prepared for how raunchy it was... well that and it wasn't all that funny. Part two is definitely as raunchy, but 1.) It isn't as sex heavy. I didn't watch Deadpool for frequent sex scenes or sex references.\n2.) It is funnier. They added some more visual humor which had me laughing-out-loud a lot more than the Ryan Reynolds' quips. \n3.) It has better action. By adding some other super powered characters we go to see some better action. \n4.) The story is so much better. Deadpool finds himself having to be selfless to save someone and it's not the bland save-the-girlfriend bit.I truly enjoyed this movie and I like the direction Deadpool is moving. It is trending upward."
"'Opening plot spoiler is they kill off Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) before the credits so we lose the banter that worked so well in the first film. Her death weighed heavy into the plot themes as the plot lacked. Don\'t feel too bad, because in X-Men, time travel is possible and they can bring her back in any episode. The film includes numerous pop culture references and asides as if to critique itself. In one scene Deadpool signs an autograph as Ryan Reynolds and if anything they may have used this type of humor too often. Julian Dennison, who we loved as the orphan in Hunt for the Wilderpeople continues as the disagreeable orphan. Zazie Beetz takes over for Morena Baccarin in the off beat comedy role. Her super power is luck. Brad Pitt is listed as The Vanisher in the credits, but was never seen and I don\'t recall any lines. Matt Damon also in a cameo. Guide: Heavy swearing. Butt nudity.'"
"DEADPOOL 2 is the sequel to the surprisingly funny superhero spoof starring Ryan Reynolds. Usually I'm not a fan of Reynolds but he fits the role well here and a lot of his quick-wire dialogue is funny, with plenty of satirical and witty humour littered amid the crudity. This sequel is slightly worse than the first film, but at least it's fast-paced and action-packed. The X-Men parallels are fun and the plot keeps you guessing, with a string of quirky supporting characters proving a match for our hero. Hardly a ground-breaking movie, but it does entertain and that's what matters."
Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) has to deal with a teen mutant called Firefist (Julian Dennison) who has anger issues. Then Cable (Josh Brolin) comes from the future. It seems Firefist as an adult killed his wife and kid and wants to kill him before he grows up.\nSequel to the wildly successful original. However it's not as good. A LOT of the jokes are carried over from the original and they aren't funnier the second time around. Also at almost two hours it's too long. On the plus side the acting is good and Brolin clearly enjoys playing Cable. Lots of action and violence too. So--it's up to you if you want to see it.
"LAPD officer K(Gosling, cynical on the surface) investigates an unusual case. No, sorry, that's all you're getting for plot. If you see someone getting into a lot of detail, avert your eyes. Go into this as blind as Niander(Leto, driven by his cause). Thank me later.This is 2 hours and 33 minutes long, which is not excessive considering how it uses its time. The pacing allows some scenes to go on for a while, however, it's always appropriate. Major props to whoever thought Denis Villeneuve would be right for this. He couldn't be more perfectly chosen. His use of symbolism, exploration of philosophy and compelling themes fit as a companion to the film Ridley Scott created, without merely redoing it(the hints are neat, if perhaps a tad too numerous). This expands upon the issues about Replicants in truly inspired ways(albeit I acknowledge that not all of them were thought up purely for this movie). The acting is sublime. If Joi(Armas, expressing so much with so much forced restraint, for reasons I won't reveal) doesn't break your heart, get an EKG stat, it's stopped beating already. This is not driven by action, rather, the gripping mystery.There is some bloody, even brutal, violence, nudity and disturbing material in this, used well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys speculative sci-fi. 10/10"
"'Baz Luhrmann and The Great Gatsby sounds real eccentric. And this adaptation is the proof. I admitt, for me, Robert Redford remains the only Jay Gatsby. And the spectacular recreation of 1920 decade, the flavor of period, the luxury mixed with heavy kitsch are far to be surprising from this kind of director. But the film has two good pillars, more than interesting - Carrey Mulligan as Daisy and fascinating Wolfsheim by the great Amitabh Bachchan . And, not the last, the shining di Caprio, more portrait from an old Hollyiwood poster than the expected Gatsby. Another good point remains the tragic romanticism use. And the nice Nick Carraway of Tobey Maguire. Short, a glamorous film. Seductive, mpressive, moving. Not the best but real, real good. For details, performances and its admirable director.'"
"Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) recalls his time with Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio). It's 1922 on Long Island. Nick rents a small house next to Jay's mansion. He is constantly throwing big parties. Nick is visited by his cousin Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) and her husband Tom (Joel Edgerton).Baz Luhrmann definitely injects his vision of the roaring 20s. The music is perfect. The movie has the grandiose vision that it so desperately needs. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for this role. In many ways, he brings his real life and breathes it into this character. His real life models-filled-partying ways make it so realistic. Carey Mulligan brings a more sweet sensibility. However Tobey Maguire and his non-stop literary narration isn't always needed. Unlike the visuals, more is not always the best. What is truly needed is a solid lens for the audience to view the proceedings. Tobey is more a shaky cam. The last 1/3 is too slow. It needs a more tension filled resolution. All in all, it's beautiful and Leo's perfect."
"'Frank Darabont brings Stephen King\'s novel to life. It stays true to the book and will hold your interest the whole three hours running time. Tom Hanks is a prison guard that befriends one giant of a prisoner played by Michael Duncan. Amazing things begin to happen on the Green Mile leading to execution on death row. Also turning in stunning performances are Michael Jeter, Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Rockwell. This drama has it\'s humorous moments. This is a dark and moody tale that is Oscar worthy.'"
"M.C. Duncan steals the picture with a tremendous supporting performance as a black gentleman, accused of murdering two children, who has a gift to heal people. No, he is not Elmer Gantry, but you know that he couldn't be guilty of such a crime by his very demeanor.An elderly man tells the story to a woman in a nursing home of when he was a guard some 60+ years before.We meet a whole assortment of condemned prisoners as well as one of the guards who is as sadistic as they come.Tom Hanks is grand as the young guard who shows compassion for the inmates.The film is also definitely one exposing the horrors of the death penalty.There is a fine supporting cast as well with Patricia Clarkson, a grossly under-rated actress, doing a stunning turn as a woman dying of a brain tumor.The film gets even better when a chain of events allows practically everyone to get what they deserved with the exception of the Duncan character."
"'more than a film, it is a fascinating embroidery. more than a good adaptation, it is a special meeting. because it is a graceful portrait of miracle and the image of Michael Clarke Duncan remains in memory a long time after the end of the film.because it has the simple charm of the old fashion stories and the desire to respect the book has a magnificent result. because it is a Stephen King but it has not only the virtue to be a good adaptation. it represents a beautiful exploration of the nuances. and a special portrait of emotions. the perfect cast in an inspired movie about the force of intentions. a film who becomes magic. for this cause must see it. and than, sure, discover the book.'"
"2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl boasts a large British cast, consisting of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly, Jack Davenport, Orlando Bloom, and Jonathan Price. Impressive. Their acting is good. But you could have put a bunch of unknowns in this film along with Johnny Depp and the film would still have been a hit.Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, who goes along with blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) as he tries to find Elizabeth Swann, his love (Knightley). She is the daughter of the governor and has been kidnapped by the awful Captain Barbossa (Rush). Barbossa and his crew live under an old curse. They're not dead but they're not alive either. The curse can't be broken without returning all of the gold with each pirate's blood back into the chest.Because of the medallion Elizabeth wears, Barbossa believes she is the one he wants. If he gets her medallion and puts her blood on it, the curse will be broken. He's in for a shock.There are some great special effects, suspense, and humor in this overly long film, as well as some wonderful acting, but Johnny Depp steals the film. His hilarious Jack Sparrow, based on Keith Richard, is fantastic. He makes this a film a cut above the usual adventure film by giving such a quirky performance. As he would say, savvy?"
"'Superman is undoubtedly one of the most ancient superheroes of many generations in many countries. The story of Kal-el and the fate of his doomed planet Krypton are absolutely well-known of most persons. Along the decades, we have read comic books and seen movies in the theaters and shows in television with minor modifications or deviations from the original story. Man of Steel is an awful reinvention of the Superman, with explosions plus explosions and CGI. However, the essence of the superhero is gone. It is ridiculous the destruction of the entire city to save Earth and the visual concept of Krypton and the Phantom Zone; actually they are pretext to use more CGI and explosions. Clark Kent letting his father die? Superman killing villains? If there is no other possibility of writing a new decent adventure of this superhero, let\'s him rest in peace and create a new hero. But do not destroy the Superman. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): O Homem de AÃ§o (The Man of Steel)'"
"'Starting in 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) with the help and money from his roommate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) first create a website called FaceMash where pictures of female students are pitted against each other to create a ranking. This got him into trouble with the school, and recruited by Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer) to work on their social networking site. However he ends up launching his own site with Saverin which would eventually be known as \'Facebook\' with the help of internet entrepreneur Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Zuckerberg and Saverin would fall out leading to the lawsuit which is the basis of the flashbacks.Everything starts with the collaboration between director David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin. The snappy dialog from Sorkin sings off the lips of Eisenberg. Fincher\'s directions infuse the movie with energy. And Garfield creates humanity in his character. This Zuckerberg is a stand-offish awkward creature with full knowledge of his superiority. It is an unique character and an unique film.'"
"It is really hard to find something bad to say about this brilliant movie. David Fincher directs Aaron Sorkin's screenplay about the skyrocket status of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg(Jesse Eisenberg)to Internet superstar. Of course when things are accomplished resulting in more money than anyone really needs; friends can easily become enemies. Zuckerberg juggles business relationships with co-founder and money man Eduardo Saverin(Andrew Garfield)and Napster founder Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake). This Harvard undergrad and computer programing wiz just wanted to find female friendship and ended up creating a social network that would eventually end up putting more than a million people in touch with like minded others half way around the world. The ownership of Facebook would end up in question when the Winklevoss twins(Armie Hammer and Josh Pence)put up a bitter courtroom fight for control of the network claiming the young entrepreneur stole their original idea while building it for them. This biographic chronicle deserves every bit of the kudos from the Golden Globes and Oscars. And it seems to employ the cast of millions...well you know what we mean. Garnering screen time are the likes of: Rooney Mara, Joseph Mazzello, Brenda Song, Malese Jow, Bryan Barter, Patrick Mapel, Jayk Gallagher, Mariah Bonner and even writer Sorkin. Interesting way to spend a couple of hours that seem to fly by."
"'First, I should admit that I can\'t verify the accuracy of The Social Network. Nonetheless, David Fincher\'s look at Facebook\'s origins is a very engrossing movie. Part of the point that it makes is that Mark Zuckerberg clearly did some ethically questionable things on his way to becoming the first millennial billionaire. Then again, did anyone become a billionaire 100% ethically? Jesse Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a nerdy but ambitious student, taking an idea hatched by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both played by Armie Hammer) and using it to enrich himself. He even antagonized his erstwhile friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). At least as portrayed in the movie.The Social Network does come out really good. The main question that it seems to be posing is how honestly any business has come about. Of course, people might not consider that as they spend all day on Facebook.Definitely worth seeing.'"
"Thirty years after the events of the first movie in 1982, there is a new blade runner, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), under pressure to complete an important assignment. K manages to find a long buried secret that can plunge the current remaining society into total chaos. Officer K's discovery tends to be just part of a major quest to find a former LAPD blade runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) , who appears to be in self-imposed exile for the last thirty years. Stunning to look at, but at times tedious. Holding things together is a soundtrack featuring Hans Zimmer & Benjiman Wallfisch, Lauren Daigle, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Dennis Villeneuve directs a cast led by: Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Dave Bautista, Jared Leto, Sylvia Hoeks, Edward James Olmos, David Dastmalchian and Sean Young."
'I was very disappointed with this Oscar-nominated film of 2010. It basically has many of the antics of the old college films. The only difference here is the intellectual connotation due to the rise of the facebook technological theme.Jesse Eisenberg is definitely credible as facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. The film deals with the suit filed by others against Zuckerberg and his chums for allegedly stealing the facebook idea for himself.There are the many foolish college life scenes still depicted in the film.The film starts with Eisenberg talking a mile a minute on a date. It is only when he meets up with the Justin Timberlake character that he becoming a maneuvering character. The film shows some accurate traditional problems of corporate management. The problem of Eduardo is dealt with in the way you generally expect such problems to be handled.The film is not even in the class of this year\'s superb The King\'s Speech.'
"Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie. Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.Disappointing, but entertaining enough."
"'I was able to watch the Sixth Sense on DVD on its first release today. As enjoyable as this movie is, the \'extras\' on the DVD make it twice as enjoyable. Included is a fine interview with the writer/director that helps put the whole story in perspective, which includes his personal and family influences.The votes currently place this movie at about #23 on the top 250 movies of all time. That\'s probably a bit of an overrating, considering all the other fine movies in the list. However, for any person who sees it and loves it can also make a legitimate case that it is their favorite of all time.My review doesn\'t really say anything about the story itself. That is because it is best viewed if you know nothing about it first. Except to say that it is one of the very few movies that gets high ratings from viewers of all ages, and genders! If you haven\'t yet, then see it. The DVD version if you can, and watch the extras after. Jan 2007 update: I watched it again yesterday. Even though I knew the basic story, and how it would turn out, it was still a worthwhile re-watch. Night may never match his first effort.'"

Fantastic animated fantasy by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki constructs a unique story about a little girl who winds up in an amusement park for the spirit world and must save her parents' fate of being turned into swine all the while encountering odd characters, both benevolent and malevolent.  Awesome set pieces and colorful dreamscapes perpetuate the engrossingly entertaining storyline as it progresses with much humor, dread and sense of utter disbelief at just how magical animation can be.  One of the best of its genre."
"Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino is a spoiled unhappy girl moving with her parents to the countryside. Her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of the entrance to an abandoned theme park. They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best. He's done plenty of great work but this is the pinnacle. It's a simple coming-of-age story but filled with magic and wonder. It added to the language of animated cinema."
"Spirited Away, the latest film from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki (a genius to Disney animators, such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US), is a wonderful family film, that works on numerous levels for kids, not the least being the creative storyline, and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of, well, an anime movie. The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion (perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination. Even those strident fans of maturer (err extra violent) anime pictures will want to look, maybe more than once. Works on many levels and I recommend it of course, if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke. Grade: A (or 9.5/10)"
"Now then, where do we start? On the plus side, this is one of the more intelligent applications of CGI in an historical drama setting. The film delivers lots of epic grandeur; the at sea-scenes/battles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding. Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke. This is undoubtedly a story that could have made Cecil B De Mille proud, instead I suspect he's have nodded off..."
"if there's one scene indicative of this film it's the opening scene where two armies face one another . They decided to settle their differences by having a fight between their greatest warrior . Call for Achilles who has to battle a man mountain . Some time is taken by introducing this character who we are told is unlikable but a superlative warrior . He comes to the battlefield , all eyes are upon and if you blink you'll miss him killing his opponent . Anti-climatic isn't a strong enough description The rest of the film progresses in the same way . You constantly notice that this might be a good film but there's several factors stopping this from happening that you can't put your finger on . One fault that is painfully noticeable is that the two leads are played by Pitt and Bana neither of who are suited to the material . Brad Pitt might provide box office and eye candy but he's an absolutely hopeless actor . Bana is a good actor but this type of historical adventure is beyond him and he gives a stilted unconvincing performance made worse by the British cast in general and Brian Cox in particular who have spent many years treading the boards doing Shakespeare . In summary Troy is watchable but never more than that"
"Darren Aronofsky is certainly a talented director. PI was an intriguing debut, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM capitalised on that promise with astonishing clarity, THE FOUNTAIN was deeply flawed, but THE WRESTLER was back on track, a heartfelt, faux documentary-cum-character study of a broken man. The good news is that BLACK SWAN is another winner, a creepy and intriguing little movie that's all about the mystery.Although the film is ostensibly about ballet, in reality this is one of those 'slowly losing their mind' type films a la THE MACHINIST. The type of film where the protagonist is plagued by weird visions, delusions and nightmare, a generally subtle effort punctuated by grisly little moments of wince-inducing violence. The screenplay is intelligent and mature, focusing on the characters throughout, and the movie is equally viewable in both the dialogue and dance sequences.I've never liked Natalie Portman, but it's a credit to Aronofsky that she's captivating here and precisely chosen as the porcelain figure leading the show. There are some fine supporting parts as well, particularly from a spiky Mila Kunis, a suave Vincent Cassel (seriously, this man can do no wrong) and a where's-she-been? Winona Ryder. BLACK SWAN is a familiar, if great little movie and well worth a watch for film fans in that it portrays a gripping journey into the dark reaches of the human psyche."
"Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a New York City ballerina living with her overbearing mother (Barbara Hershey). The prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) is being replaced for the opening production of Swan Lake. Nina is the favorite, but new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) is impressive as well. Nina fits the role of the beautiful, fearful, fragile White Swan perfectly, but she can't get the Black Swan role right unlike Lily. She's obsessed with her deteriorating body as her paranoid mind collapses.This is a great performance from Natalie Portman. There's a sense of chaos and insanity falling down on her. It definitely has the sensibility of director Darren Aronofsky. Although I do wonder where he's going with this movie at times. It has a realism and a horror feel to the movie. Portman's body slowly turns into a horror show is reminiscent of Jeff Goldblum picking apart his body in 'The Fly'. Mila Kunis is playing a pretty interesting mean girl, or is it all in Nina's head. That's the beauty of this movie. It plays not just with Nina's mind, but the audience's mind."
"'Launched in 1999 and one of the most successful movies of the year, Matrix is an amazing movie. It ranks among the movies that leave the spectator bemused, even after several projections.In a way, it\'s very similar to Paul Verhoeven\'s movie Total Recall (1990). The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay, astounding special effects and especially, a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie, he\'s introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life. But an unexpected event will transform his life and make him a hero.Matrix is also a very well stable movie that you can divide in two parts: the first one mainly focuses on long dialogs sequences that incline to reflection while the second one honors stunning action sequences.A remarkable performance crowns it all and Keanu Reeves finds here his best role to date. The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this, maybe to give their movie, a Hollywood nature.An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties.'"
"'I didn\'t know what Requiem for a Dream was about when I rented it, and I was stunned. This ultra-gritty look at several people\'s lives degenerating due to drug usage is like nothing that you\'ve ever seen. It\'s more polished than Pi, but no less eye-popping. As mentally decaying retiree Sara Goldfarb, Ellen Burstyn makes your blood freeze the same way that she did in The Exorcist. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans also bring to their roles an intensity rarely seen on screen. And let me tell you, I never could have predicted what would happen during those last few minutes! In conclusion, see this movie if you dare. I should warn you that it may knock your breath out. You have been warned. Also starring Christopher McDonald and Louise Lasser.'"
"Requiem for a Dream is a grim, intense, choppy, trippy film about drug abuse. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a frumpy retiree who watches television all day. She wants to fit into her red dress as she believes she will appear in her favourite show and is on diet pills to lose weight.The pills are actually amphetamines and they make her hallucinate.Sara's son Harry (Jared Leto) is a drug addict, he steals from her, he is gaunt from the drugs, his arm ruined by the injections.His girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is on a downward spiral. To score, to survive she will have to take part in sex parties, humiliating herself. Their best pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) realise that drug addiction has overtaken their lives and they are heading for the bottom of the barrel.Director Darren Aronofsky is fascinated by the use of the camera and sound. He uses split screens, fast cuts, speeded up editing, flashbacks to show the characters wanting their drugs, then the effect of the hit and later the withdrawal.It is an assault on the senses, it is also a provocative film but I felt that the visual tricks were disguising a thin story."
"'I can not compare this movie to anything I have ever seen before. Well written and superbly directed. The acting was so good it made limit pushing activities look some what normal. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as the man trapped in a miserable life. Annette Bening is so real as the work obsessed wife with no time for her husband. Thora Birch is pedestrian as the daughter lacking self confidence. Talk about a show stopper; Mena Suvari plays the flirtatious tart with zest. She can make any man go to the garage and start pumping iron.A man making haphazard choices in trying to recover his life is not so much out of the norm. True this is a sad look at a  family that is set on self destruction. Sometimes it takes witnessing the likes of this to help you realize that your own problems are very small in comparison. Fantasy situations are part of real life. This movie will rank among the great ones.Also in the cast are: Wes Bentley, Peter Gallagher and Scott Bakula.'"
"Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is enduring a cold marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) is obsessed with her real estate career. He is obsessed with his daughter's sexy friend Angela (Mena Suvari). His daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is the object of obsession by the next door neighbor boy Ricky (Wes Bentley). Ricky has a domineering angry military father (Chris Cooper), and he sells weed.Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have captured the mood of obsessions and secrets in suburbia. This plays like a voyeuristic peep show as the characters peel back the layers of secrets. It's not creepy but it is enchanting. This movie lures you in, and traps you in something forbidden. Kevin Spacey is absolutely wonderful as a torn man. And Thora Birch is great as the angry daughter. It's the perverse mundaneness of suburbia and its many secrets."
"An amazing and sad statement about American values, about having the courage to change your life totally when you feel you have nothing to lose, about finding out what's important just as it's too late.  A wow of a movie with so many dimensions, amplified by sensational performances. How can something be so depressing yet uplifting, be about parents who have screwed their lives up so horribly and yet give you hope that the young people have a chance to evolve?  I guess that's true genius."
"Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Sonoya Mizuno. Music is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and cinematography by Rob Hardy.A young programmer is thrilled to be selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment involving synthetic intelligence. He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10"
"EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it."
"'What makes us human? Or superior for that matter? And would we able to share this with something we created? Call it Frankenstein (monster) or whatever else comes to mind, but the movie itself has quite a few things it wants to tell us. You might not feel or empathize completely with the main character (he\'s a bit shy and easy to impress, but he has to be) or with the guy who hired him.But especially bro Oscar Isaak relishes in his role. And he has a tough one to play with. It\'s really a thin line he has to walk here. Is he a villain? Aren\'t there gray areas too? Should we judge him? Isn\'t he fun to hang around with though? Full of contradictions, as the movie itself. The science fiction idea of it (at least the current moment science fiction, who knows what the future holds for us) is either intriguing enough for you or it ain\'t. Whatever the case, the movie lived up to the hype surrounding it'"
"The franchise continues in the second movie in the series. There is a good step upwards in the quality of FX, CGI, and sets. We get introduced to Dobby, the house elf. He's a good CGI character. More importantly, he's a likable character which is so different from a certain Star Wars character who shall not be named. It's a big relief that Dobby is a good success.If there is something missing, it's a darker and scarier Chamber of Secrets. With so much built up, the final section should be a more thrilling and scary ride. It's like a horror movie that doesn't deliver in the end. I think Chris Columbus has reached his limits. It's just not in him to deliver the mood, the thrills, or the scary moments."
"This is still a favorite of ours for 20+ years now, our most recent viewing was last night on my DVD copy of the movie. We have probably watched it 5 or 6 times over the years.This of course won the Oscar for Damon's and Affleck's script, which itself originated from a paper Damon wrote while in college. Quite an unlikely development for two 20-something friends but in watching the movie yet again I am struck with how well several meaningful themes are woven in the script.The main theme is Damon's character, Will Hunting, who has a brilliant mind but as an orphan was abused in his foster home, resulting in his building a mostly impenetrable shell around himself. Some of the best scenes are with him and his psychologist Sean, played by Robin Williams.And Ben Affleck, Damon's best friend in real life, is Will's best friend Chuckie who doesn't have a brilliant mind and accepts that he will be a laborer all his life. He would feel insulted if Will ended up wasting his gift.All this comes to a head when Will meets Skyler who will soon be graduating from college and heading out west for medical school. She and Will fall in love but Will is scared to commit himself to a relationship. In the end he has to decide if he will just stay in Boston."
"'Insomniac computer hacker Keanu Reeves (as Thomas Neo Anderson ) lives a common and interesting life. Hugo Weaving (as Agent Smith) tells him, You\'ve been living two lives. In one life, you\'re Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, pay your taxes, and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias \'Neo\' and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future, and one of them does not. That\'s a good description. Everything changes for Mr. Reeves when he is contacted by the intriguingly prophetic Laurence Fishburne (as Morpheus), through seemingly supernatural leather lass Carrie-Anne Moss (as Trinity). Mr. Fishburne believes Reeves just may be The One. Mr. Weaving captures Reeves, and tells him Fishburne is the most dangerous man alive. Reeves instinctively distrusts Weaving and, with Ms. Moss\' assistance escapes from him. Them, Reeves joins falls Through the Looking Glass, where he learns about and dreams, reality, and imagination, from the Wachowski brothers.Unfortunately, nobody can be told what \'The Matrix\' is.

"'Good Will Hunting is a great film.  It brings, heart, good (and bad) nature, and many other things in this tale of a janitor at MIT who is terrific at math.  This man Will Hunting (played remarkably by Matt Damon) has many flaws though, and soon, he meets his match- Sean, a psychologist (Robin Williams gives a well deserved Oscar winning performance here) and little by little, starts to change.  The way the film shows us Will , Sean and the supporting characters is spectacular and nothing is funnier than a Boston accent.  Great all around.'"
"'Muscular genius Matt Damon (as Will Hunting) works as a janitor at Boston\'s M.I.T. (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); but, he\'s smarter than the professors teaching there, like Stellan Skarsgard (as Gerald Lambeau). When nobody\'s looking, Mr. Damon solves complex mathematic problems on Mr. Skarsgard\'s chalkboard. At night, he goes out carousing with Ben Affleck (as Chuckie Sullivan), a likewise handsome drinking buddy. Mr. Affleck wants best friend Damon to use his head for more than a hat-rack.Abused as a orphan, Damon likes to take his pals out to beat guys up, as a chaser. Eventually, this socio-emotional behavior lands Damon in jail. Professor Skarsgard, who has discovered Damon\'s a fellow intellect, sets him up on probation, with psychologist Robin Williams (as Sean Maguire). Mr. Williams asks Damon if he has a soul mate. Damon is dating pre-med Minnie Driver (as Skylar), but has trouble committing. Can Ms. Driver, Affleck, Skarsgard, and Williams save Damon from a lifetime of janitorial eloquence?

"Well,finally Leonardo DiCaprio wins an Oscar.He felt that he should have been nominated for his earlier movie Titanic but never mind.At least,now he can finally be proud of the The Revenant for it wasn't only a nomination that he got but a trophy itself for an Academy Award for Best Actor.This film by Alejandro G. IÃ±Ã¡rritu is based from the novel of Michael Punke's novel of the same title.It stars DiCaprio together with Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter.It tells the story of frontiersman Hugh Glass particularly his experiences in 1823.During an expedition in an uncharted American territory,legendary explorer Hugh Glass is brutally attacked by a bear and has been left for dead by the member of his frontier.But showing sheer determination and strong will to survive,Glass tries his best to live out the unimaginable circumstances that has left him to join his family back. He tries to navigate through a cruel winter and harsh realities that has left him behind.No question that this is a great film.It showcases the triumph of the human spirit and the extraordinary power of a person to survive amid abominable circumstances.Anybody who are facing trials and challenges in this world will definitely find it worth-watching and truly enjoyable.They would be inspired by it."
"Either too much or not enough can be said about THE REVENANT. Leonardo DiCaprio most definitely earned his Oscar; the movie was robbed of being Best Picture.This snowy thriller is set in the early 1820's and follows the trials and tribulations of a fur trapper, Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), as he relentlessly seeks retribution against the fur trapping companions who left him for dead near the icy Missouri River after being mauled by a bear. Plus there will be hell to pay for one trapper, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), who murdered Glass' Pawnee Indian son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck).Exceptionally filmed, except sometimes the wilderness doesn't seem too remote. But still a beautiful movie to look at. Character development was well done and did not set a problem of who any villain might be. It was a little strange listening to 1800's trappers using modern slang. The sequence of the bear attack was hard to watch brutal. My other favorite scene is the climactic ruthless fight.I believe this will be one of those movies one will want to watch again and again. It is already in my plans.A very hard working cast that also features: Domhnall Gleeson, Fabrice Adde, Will Poulter, Duane Howard, Melaw Nakehk'o, Arthur Redcloud, Paul Anderson, Christopher Rosamond and Grace Dove."
"'There aren\'t many moments in the movie that aren\'t intense as hell. The brutality of the Indian attack that opens the story is barely over when the picture launches into the media hyped bear attack on the principal character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. I\'m not a fan of his but I can recognize the amount of effort that went into this role, and so I feel his Best Actor award is well earned. Before the Oscars were announced I had a feeling the picture would take the top award as well, that was before I saw the film. I can see how this movie might not have been at the top of Academy members\' voting lists. It\'s not an easy picture to watch, as many of the scenes like the one showing the results of the bear mauling are cringe worthy. It reminded me of the wounds in The Passion of the Christ and leaves you wondering how mere mortals could possibly survive them even in normal conditions, let alone the harsh environment trapper Hugh Glass (DiCaprio) found himself in. One\'s attention as the viewer is constantly reminded of the unforgiving nature of the terrain Glass must fight his way through to seek vengeance on the man who left him for dead. The entire picture is a testament to one man\'s perseverance, exemplified by Glass\'s own words in my summary line above.'"
"LOGAN (2017) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Richard E. Grant, Eriq La Salle, Elis Neal, Quincy Fouse. Spectacularly supreme swan song for X-Men anti-hero Wolverine AKA Logan (the erstwhile, world-weary Jackman having a field day in his strongest outing as Wolfie) set in the near future whose attempts to remain off the grid are thwarted when a new mutant (amazing new comer Keen) has been discovered by his old friend Professor Xavier (ditto Stewart) which also crops up old nemesis The Reavers led by hissable Holbrook hot on their trail. Director James Mangold (who co-wrote with Scott Frank & Michael Green) enfuses the franchise spin-off with some new insights and a damn well pay dirt in going very dark and very graphically (and wholeheartedly welcome) unleashed violence. At its heart is literally that - heart, surprisingly well-crafted and executed particularly with dynamo Keen (a cross between The Road Warrior's Feral Kid and Kick-Ass' Hit Girl) gloweringly lethal."
"'The Galaxy Defenders in their very first mission (or is it? With prequels and such you never know really). The movie on hand though does work very well (even the little CGI that was used held up quite good I\'d say), which is the achievement (especially) by the actors! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones work perfectly together. The stern almost emotionless Tommy (aka K) and the energetic J, who\'s all over the place. That formula works like magic.Of course there is other things that make this fun, like the aliens that live among us for years. You might recognize one or two of them. Some are in the background some are shown very openly. A good mix of Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy.'"
"'I first saw MEN IN BLACK about 4 years ago and wasn`t too taken with it thinking it was just a FX laden blockbuster with a shallow script and after seeing it again earlier tonight my opinion hasn`t changed much . For a movie based upon a comic strip it felt too much like a ...eh well a comic strip . There`s no tightly plotted story , instead we`re treated to a script that seems to have been written to show off some special effects to the pop corn munching audience which is a pity because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do make a very good double act , the humour hits the right spot ( Sly Stallone is an alien ! ) and the effects are actually quite good - It`s just a pity the plot is vague and meandering'"
"Either you love it or you hate it. K(Tommy Lee Jones) and J(Will Smith)are top-secret government agents, investigating alien visitations on Earth, who must stop an alien terrorist(Vincent D'Onofrio)from causing an intergalactic disaster. Witty and amazing insect-type aliens steal the show. F/X are superb. Also in the cast are Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub and the alluring Linda Fiorentino. Sci-Fi takes on a different look."
"Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic."
"Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a regular guy from Long Island working at the ground level in a Wall Street firm where Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) is the star broker. On the first day of him becoming a licensed stockbroker, the market crashes in Black Monday. His firm goes bankrupt and he's thrown into the streets. With the support of his wife Teresa (Cristin Milioti), he ends up working in a Long Island boiler room dealing in penny stocks. He starts his own firm gathering a group of questionable salesman like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). He quickly rises gaining the attention of FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler). It is a drug-filled, stripper-strutting, midget-throwing wild-partying office. Jordan has an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) and eventually even marrying her. However the high life doesn't last even with their own Swiss banker.This has some funny moments and sometimes even gut busting hilarity. I do have a small problem trying to enjoy this movie at the start. Jordan becomes essentially a con man. The joke is that they're having all this fun but I can never forget that the fun is done on everybody else's dime. The characters laugh while I cringe. About halfway through, I do get acclimatized and feel more at ease with the movie. There are some great scenes. The scene of Jordan rallying the troops for the Steve Madden IPO is amazing. Leo gives a full-out performance."
"'I have always said that the James Bond franchise died after Sean Connery left. Casino Royale affirms that. Like every installment after Connery left, this one consists of overwrought gimmicks and a less than obvious story. Twenty minutes into the movie, we had already had enough of the action (that whole chase scene in Madagascar would have been cool with Jackie Chan, but it\'s boring with anyone else). True, there are a few hot babes to move things along, but they can\'t equal the quality set up by the first three movies. Daniel Craig did far better in Munich.And another thing: why does it seem like so many people hate John Huston\'s 1967 version of Casino Royale? True, that one was totally silly, but it wasn\'t pretending to be anything else. And besides, how can you not admire a cast of David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and Ursula Andress (hubba hubba!)? My point is that this version is not worth your while. I recommend avoiding it.'"
"'After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.'"
"'This film tells the story of a team of superheroes who save the world from an evil and ambitious extraterrestrial man.Being a blockbuster, The Avengers does have all the elements to entertain the crowd. The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot.'"
"'At this point, The Avengers has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it\'s obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn\'t take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn\'t quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn\'t quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it\'s just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in The Avengers. Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren\'t fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...'"
Based on fact movie but the war at Dunkirk. British and French soldiers are trapped at Dunkirk waiting to take a ship back to England. However the Germans are doing a non-stop bombing of Dunkirk beach (where the soldiers are) and the ships coming to save them.Visually this is an impressive movie. The visuals are stunning (especially in IMAX) and the battle sequences are beautifully shot. However there's no emotional involvement with the main characters. You know their names--and that's about it. It's really hard to give a damn if you know nothing about them. I suppose the acting was good but--since they're given nothing to work with--I really couldn't tell.So visually it's impressive but emotionally cold. Try to see it in IMAX.
"'Dunkirk is a forgettable and dull war film absolutely overrated in IMDb. There is no character development and the viewer does not care for anybody who lives or dies. The shallow screenplay is awful and the Batle of Dunkirk is limited to the evacuation of the Allied soldiers, most of them British, that stay in lines on the beach or on a dock attacked and slaughtered by the German airplanes. The plot focuses basically in three simultaneous storylines: the first based on an old man with two teenagers in a boat trying to rescue soldiers; the second on a Spitfire pilot that crashes his airplane on the water and is rescued by the old man; and the third on a Navy Commander in charge of the attempt of evacuating the soldiers. Better of watching again a classic war movie than spending 1h 46 min watching his terrible film by the usually overrated Christopher Nolan. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Dunkirk'"
"One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right."
"'. . . (which comes AFTER all the closing credits) will learn that it\'s now Open Season on Harry Potter & Friends. When Mordo attacks Pangborn, he mutters The world has too many wizards. This is a dead giveaway that Disney MegaBlobCorp intends on forcing AT&T to spin off Master Potter\'s Warner Bros. Studio to the House of Louse as the price of regulatory approval for AT&T\'s acquisition of Time Warner. That way, the D-Blob will swallow up Warner\'s Potter Properties, just as they devoured Pixar, the Muppets, ESPN, ABC, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars. Anytime now we can expect a flick to hit the Big Screens in which Mordo sets his sights on Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Disney Multiverse. Kiefer Sutherland as the DESIGNATED SURVIVOR will be divvying up Kermit, LeBron, Woody, Luke, Miss Piggy, Thor, Nemo, Draco, Anakin, Bryce, Elmo, Ironman, Dory, Quasimodo, Jarjar, Wolverine, Ernie, and all the Princesses from Leia to Elsa into Team Mordo and Team Potter. Perhaps the Disney Blob will release what amounts to a gooey glob, but it cannot be much cheesier than the psychedelic Outer Space DOCTOR STRANGE spin on GROUNDHOG DAY. (Would you like some spaghetti with your multicolored meatballs, Doc?) By ripping bits and pieces from both good movies (INCEPTION) and bombs (THE LAST AIRBENDER), at least DOCTOR STRANGE is an Equal Opportunity target for copyright infringement lawsuits.'"
"Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!"
"'Over the years, I had heard of many superheros: Superman, Spider-Man, the Hulk, the X Men. However, until Jon Favreau\'s Iron Man came to theaters, I had never heard of Iron Man! That made the movie even more of a treat. I liked how they incorporated world events into the story: in this case, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) makes weapons for the army but has misgivings after his experience in Afghanistan. I\'ll admit that I\'m not really any fan of superhero stories. But I do think that they did a good job with this movie, so I recommend it.Also starring Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sayed Badreya, and of course Stan Lee in a brief appearance.'"

'I like the bit when the warden threw the rock through the poster.'
"In 1978, I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman and believed a man could fly (gimme a break... I was only 10); 1989, and The Rocketeer made me want to soar across the heavens (and, being 21, also get off with Jennifer Connelly). Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"'300 Once again, not having high expectations turned a movie into a pleasant surprise. Oh, this isn\'t anything super, but it is a lot better than I had heard. Yeah, I heard the usual it\'s just moronic mayhem, nothing but blood and guts and way overdone action. Not really. I\'ve seen a number of films with a lot more action than in here. When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn\'t go on and on. It lasted a few minutes at most and broke for a lull.The only aspect I thought was sub-par was some of the dialog, which sounded juvenile in spots. That and, at least for me, I found myself unable to get involved with any of the characters. Oh, I definitely did not want the bad guy to win but I didn\'t think the good guy was anything appealing, either.What WAS appealing were the colors in here and the special-effects. What a tremendous visual movie this is, just stunning in parts and interesting to look at from start-to-finish. That\'s what held my attention. Sure, I could tell the obvious computer-generated effects, but so what? This movie simply was fun to ogle, with all it\'s incredible scenery, outrageous monster-like characters and dramatic colors. For that alone, this movie is worth seeing.'"
"Just watched Thor in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and while I admit I fell asleep during some of the beginning parts, by the time the title character's brother Loki reveals his intentions, I was riveted the rest of the picture. Kenneth Branagh is fine directing the dialogue and action sequences and the one picked to play Thor is quite charismatic especially when talking to the mortal Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. I wish I had managed to stay awake for the whole thing but still, this was a highly enjoyable movie to watch in a cinema. Oh, and Loki as the villain is very compelling when he's revealed as such and one more thing, look for creator Stan Lee in a cameo since this is a Marvel-based movie of a character he created..."
"Against his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins)'s wish, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) goes to battle the Frost Giants with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Sif, Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. He is cast out of Asgard by Odin. Astrophysicists Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) with assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are tracking spatial anomalies when they find a disoriented Thor.This is simply setting up for Marvel. They have laid out a series of movie that led to the Avengers and beyond. Kenneth Branagh directs this introduction to Thor. Chris has some work behind him, but this is his international breakout. It lays the groundwork for the world of Asgard and introduces other important characters like Loki. It's not completely compelling. There is a lot of history expositions. The Asgard world is very golden, and the frost giants live on an ice world. The movie goes into a long section in the Alien worlds at the beginning. It's a lot of CGI to slog through. The wonderment of it all wears thin. The love story is rather stiff. Natalie Portman's chemistry with Chris Hemsworth is fair but it could much better. It's a fair introduction and continuation for the grander universe."
"I remember this being so unique and cool when it first came out, and it still gives off the same vibes today. The action and CGI are amazing, the acting is well done, the actors and robots are well cast. It's a Micheal Bay movie, so of course it's just a bit too long. But the action keeps amped up throughout the entire movie. A one of a kind action/robot movie. Auto bots, roll out."
"'One of Orson Welles last film roles was The Transformers Movie, an animated film in 1986. It was regarded as a low point to go out on. However in the cinematic world the name Transformers have been transformed thanks to Michael Bay kick starting the franchise and the original is the best so far.Direction wise this has all the Bay trademarks, swirling photography, stirring music and pumping action scenes with state of the art CGI. There is even some sly digs at the all powerful government agencies abusing the extent of their powers.The plot is straightforward. Shia Labeouf is a nerd who buys a car that transforms to a robot, his grandfather once made a discovery and now two gangs of robots are beating the hell out of each other. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are the good guys. The bad guys are the Decepticons and they are after the cube of power called the All Spark. The film is not as flimsy and indulgent as the sequels. There is plenty of action, explosions and humour in this one and it all blends well to be a good popcorn film.'"
"'I think that we all know the Indiana Jones movies by now. As the main character, Harrison Ford creates a hero to whom we can all relate: tough, but not without his weaknesses. In Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy is trying to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on the Ark of the Covenant. And there\'s a plethora of action along the way.Admittedly, the Indiana Jones movies had a problem, in that their characters were totally one-dimensional (except for the fact that Indy fears snakes). But this movie isn\'t a character study, people! It\'s pure, unadulterated fun! With great support from Karen Allen (as hubby Marion Ravenwood), Denholm Elliott (as dotty Marcus Brody), and Paul Freeman (as bad guy Rene Belloq), this movie epitomizes the word cool.'"
"'It is said that Steven Spielberg was heavily influenced by the serials of the golden era, the thirties and forties, produced for the best of them, by Republic Pictures studios and directed by the likes of Bill Witney and John English or Spencer Gordon Bennett, with the great Yakima Kanutt as the master stunt scenes, more outstanding one than the other. And when I watch this film, the best of Spielberg - concerning the.leisure part of Spielberg\'s filmography - and among the best features in the movie history, I can\'t prevent myself to admit that it is a serial from the eighties. Even nearly forty years after discovering it, I am still amazed, which is not the case for many movies from the eighties, films that I discovered in my early adult life and that don\'t belong to my childhood - another life for me, as many people. When you are a child, movies are not seen the same way as when you find them when you are an adult. So back to this one, everything has already been said, I just wanted to point out the serial tribute. And I discovered forties serial from Republic pictures when I was thirty years old, already a adult.'"
"I can't say I've ever really got into this whole MCU thing, but this as a stand alone film was enjoyable enough."
"During World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 90lb weakling who keeps getting rejected for military services. Then Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and recruits him for his secret scientific program where he encounters Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Rogers undergoes an experiment that makes him a new super soldier. Meanwhile the Nazis have invest heavily in a secret weapons research agency called HYDRA. Only the head of HYDRA Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) has bigger goals and his own ambitions.I really like the skinny Chris Evans even thought it's odd to hear his voice coming out. He and Hayley Atwell have good chemistry before and after the transformation. Their relationship is better than the usual comic book movie. As far as the action goes, it's all very CGI. That's not unexpected. However the cartoon nature and the overuse of montages really takes away much of the tension. After a good first half, the second half gets into a rambling flow of jagged story telling. Even the climax lacks the needed excitement. This ends more as a setup for future sequels."
"This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.  A++"
"'This film tells the story of a young man who is not physically fit enough to be in the Army. He is selected for a special program to transform him into a superhero that will save the United States of America.Captain America The First Avenger is quite unlike other superhero blockbusters. It starts off slow, detailing how he was bullied on the streets of Brooklyn and then in the Army training base. He is finally transformed into a superhero after one hour of screen time, which is pretty long and slow if you ask me. Then, the plot is rather unfocused, as it tells the fight between USA and Nazi Germany, and also the fight between Rogers and the bad red guy. I find the plot so unfocused that I lost interest in it altogether. It is not packed with action enough, not packed with enough thrills or excitement. Though I am a little disappointed, I think I will still watch the sequel to see if it gets any better.'"
"Quirky describes both Jim Carey and ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND. Michael Gondry directs this exercise in futile love and heartbreak. Joel(Carey)and Clementine(Kate Winslet)are a couple who's relationship has ran its course. Experimental technology allows Clementine to have any and all memories of Joel erased from her mind. Joel reluctantly decides to do the same, but in the middle of the procedure he changes his mind and struggles to keep those memories he wishes to cherish. This romantic Sci-Fi is clever, humorous, heartbreaking and very entertaining. Rounding out the cast: Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson and Elijah Wood. The story is a definite head spinner. I was most impressed with Winslet and her various hair colors...tangerine being my favorite. And if nothing else; how can a movie with Dunst dancing in her panties be bad? A decent soundtrack keeps the flick changing gears. Listen for ELO, Beck and The Willowz."
"'Director Michel Gondry, whose specialty in music videos was a seamless visual blending of reality and surreality, was the perfect filmmaker for this thoughtful, provoking drama which juggles past and present. Jim Carrey is excellent as a single man looking for love...and perhaps finding it with eccentric clerk Kate Winslet; unfortunately, a double-header secret from both their pasts may come back to haunt them. Gondry, who also worked on the original story with Pierre Bismuth and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, is masterful with a flashy scenario (both figuratively and literally), and he works surprisingly well with his eclectic group of actors. However, the characters in Kaufman\'s script aren\'t especially likable (particularly Winslet\'s argumentative love-interest) and the film is acutely chilly, with everybody bundled up and shivering. As the plot thickens, it also becomes convoluted (and, purposely one assumes, splintered); despite some missteps, Gondry works nimbly steering the viewer through the mechanisms of the narrative, and there several engaging or arresting sequences. Similar in tone and spirit to Being John Malkovich, which Kaufman also wrote, and blazing with deft, daring originality. **1/2 from ****'"
"Peter Parker AKA Spiderman is still struggling with guilt over the death of his Uncle Ben, so much so that it is beginning to affect his super spidey powers (he suffers from what you might call Arachtile Dysfunction). Meanwhile, nuclear fusion scientist Otto Octavius is causing trouble for the City of New York after one of his experiments goes a little wrong, leaving him with his powerful, mechanical, artificially intelligent arms in control of both his brain and body.The second film in Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spiderman trilogy is another hugely entertaining superhero flick, with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst reprising their roles as Peter Parker/Spiderman and Mary Jane Watson, and director Raimi once again conducting proceedings with bags of style, delivering spectacular action set-pieces and touching emotional drama aplenty.Alfred Molina also makes a great impression as villain Dr. Otto Octavius AKA Doctor Octopus, with Hollywood's best CGI effects wizards lending a hand (or four) in making such a memorable character. Ironically, the only thing that prevents this from being even better than the first film is Raimi's over-reliance on CGI effects, the director repeatedly pushing the action a little too far beyond the realms of believability, even for a superhero film."
"'Director Sam Raimi brings back the Marvel comic book hero, your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire)is still coming to terms with his dual identity. He\'s now going to college, delivering pizza and taking photos of...Spider-Man in order to pay his bills. His world is tumbling down around him; he\'s having trouble at college, his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco)is strained, his Aunt May(Rosemary Harris)is being pressured by the bank, and most of all wrestles with the thought of telling Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst)of his secret identity. The web-slinging Spider-Man has recently been bashed in the press; but NYC needs their hero for the city is threatened by Dr. Octo Octavius(Alfred Monlina)who has turned himself into Doc Ock, a multiple metal armed villain.CGI perfection. Danny Elfman\'s score meets his genius standards. The story is actually good for an action flick. I could do without the Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head sequence, but I realize it is needed to show how the weight of the world has been lifted from Parker as he temporarily tries to disown his work as Spider-Man. The pizza delivery is pretty cool; and the train fight is pulse pounding. Of course, the close-ups of Dunst also do something for me.Also in the cast are:J.K. Simmons, Daniel Gillies and the hot Venessa Ferlito. And for continuity there are the cameos of Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson. Spider-Man 2 should please children of all ages... from six to ninety-six.'"
"'Let me say I have generally enjoyed watching both Spider-Man films. They\'re fun to view, but as someone older who doesn\'t necessarily get thrilled watching teen romances, they aren\'t DVDs I would purchase. The action scenes, with Spider-Man flying around from skyscraper- to-skyscraper, are fantastic. I also loved the villain in here, the octopus-like Dr. Octavius, played just great by Alfred Molina.However, there is just too much Kirsten Dunst Mary Jane Watson) in here and the romance angles between her and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) are just annoying....too sappy, and they take away from the story too much. A little of it is fine, but that aspect of the story takes up too high a percentage of screen time.I\'ve read the comics and those concentrate mainly on Spider Man vs. various villains. I wish the movies would have done the same.'"
"'As improbable as the story is, it had a certain resonance to my mind about the capacity of the human spirit to persevere and make the best of one\'s circumstances under the most intolerable of conditions. Faced with the same situation, how many would simply give up and let fate take it\'s course? The harder thing to do is stretch one\'s mind and resources in an effort to stay alive and operate from a position of informed intelligence until help arrives. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) proclaims I\'m not gonna die here, not only do you believe it but you wish there was something you could do to help.That\'s not to say I didn\'t find some elements to be just too unbelievable. The real time communication with the rescue team, and especially the sharing of Watney\'s comments with the rest of the world defied any sort of credibility. China helping pro-actively - I don\'t think so, at least not in an official capacity. The cracking wise dialog of the crew members was also a little too forced it seemed. You would think there would be some consternation over the plight of the stranded team member.But for a sci-fi film offering a once in a lifetime what if scenario, the picture works well enough to be an entertaining diversion. I can think of worse ways to spend a couple of hours.'"
"The Ares III manned mission encounters a sand storm on Mars. Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead as the rest of the crew evacuate on their spacecraft. Mission control back on Earth is shocked when they discover that Mark is actually alive and alone on Mars.Simply put, this is a fun space adventure. There is a good deal of Apollo 13 and Gravity. Damon is humorous and engaging. Meanwhile, the mission control back on earth is doing interesting things. Nobody is the villain. Jeff Daniels is a capable bureaucratic leader. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives the team intensity and has fun scenes with Mackenzie Davis. Almost every side character adds to the group. As for the spacecraft, it's interesting to have Jessica Chastain as the commander. The entire cast is great. The whole story is thrilling. There are unexpected turns. It has the feel of reality. A lot of praise has to be given to director Ridley Scott for a well constructed film. Also it's genius to give it a disco soundtrack."
"'This was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. The script is really dreadful and the premiss that an Amazonian daughter of Zeus heads into the 20th century to help the Brits during the First World War is as far fetched as it goes. That said, there is some chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and David Thewlis is quite menacing at times as Sir Patrick/Ares. The CGI isn\'t too oppressive and the (frequent) fight scenes though lengthy, are quite well staged. It\'s all just a bit of fun - quite comedic at times - and fine to watch on that basis.'"
"'This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.Wonder Woman is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that\'s just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.'"
"'Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We\'re talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I\'d see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a thrill park ride. Now that doesn\'t mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don\'t compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie'"
"'I won\'t begin to describe the situation, you have a synopsis for that. I want to focus on the experience itself.First, the film has the look and feel of a graphic novel. This should please fans of the book even if the film strays, or has to condense a lot of back story in a small time, as it appeared to do in the opening sequence.The visual effects were stunning, and the music and sound track were superb. Any film that includes Leonard Cohen singing Hallelujah has got me.Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach was a joy to watch, as was Malin Ãkerman as Silk Spectre II.Now, I have to get the soundtrack.'"
"'Murder and absolute mayhem evolve around an organization dedicated to keep the peace. You know there is something inherently wrong with the writing of this film when possible annihilation between Russia and the United States in a nuclear war serves as a backdrop to what is really going on in this ridiculous film where the characters are dressed up as if they are comic book characters. All sorts of masks and disfigurement disguises are worn.This is basically a story of internal fighting within the organization and there is constant physical battling. We have one character, a physicist, maimed in an accident of long ago who is accused of making sure his cohorts develop malignancies. Another is set up to be imprisoned.We hear the familiar lunatic idea of making a new perfect world by killing millions of innocent people.'"
"'Well many would strongly disagree. But this is not about the quality of this sequel (some even suggesting this being superior than the first movie, that\'s not my decision to make), it is about one of the characters spewing many memorable quote. Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That\'s another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into reality.But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie. Effects are great, cast is amazing, some communication devices have dated though. Also a nice spin on the android-phobia from the first movie throughout the movie. Really well thought out and well made, one of the best sequels to an arguable classic'"
"'This sequel to Alien (1979) is a different type of movie. It\'s template is the same but the delivery and execution is quite different.Comparisons are inevitable but should be done as a reference point rather than an intolerable insight into its method of madness. Aliens is an Action film in a Sci-Fi setting with Horror elements. A pulse pounding picture with energy and enthusiasm that is admittedly less cerebral and more visceral than the first film.The cartooned, somewhat clichÃ©d action figures, that Ripley reluctantly joins are literally thrust into a meat grinder of a bug hunt and they all make the most of their training and fight the terror with bravado and courage. These are not scientists, they are Marines and they behave like Marines and give the ultimate sacrifice. The movie is what it is and it is not the first film. It is a roller-coaster ride with little Intel and a lot of intensity.'"
"It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times."
"'Let\'s start from the actors. We have Uma Thurman (a great role for her to display her power), we have the recently deceased David Carradine getting a chance to shine one more time. Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let\'s loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she\'s doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It\'s a shame, because quite a few things were promised. But then again, the Grindhouse experience hasn\'t hit home cinemas either ... we\'ll keep on waiting then ...'"
"The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens after 4 years in a coma. It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii."
"Thinking in the back of my head that Guy Ritchie's Snatch is just another clone of the Tarantino era flicks and also enormously fashioned after Ritchie's freshman effort Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels, I didn't think Snatch wouldn't be that great.  But like how Ritchie's first film surprised me, so did this film, which does the best it can and succeeds, mostly.  The plot is pretty tangled and even though the premise deals with a stolen diamond, there are side stories.  Many funny moments, however Brad Pitt (with dialogue that makes Adam Sandler's inner voice sound coherent) and a squeaking dog steal the show.  A-"

The plot is pretty tangled and even though the premise deals with a stolen diamond, there are side stories.  Many funny moments, however Brad Pitt (with dialogue that makes Adam Sandler's inner voice sound coherent) and a squeaking dog steal the show.  A-"
"Not for the hopeless romantic; but the helpless romantic. This is a touching love story based on a Nicholas Sparks novel and exceptionally directed by Nick Cassavetes. THE NOTEBOOK is about an older gentleman(James Garner), who reads from an old notebook retelling a timeless love story to his aging companion(Gena Rowlands)in a nursing home. The tale brings back the love story of a young couple(Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams)who are separated by social class, a World War and a planned wedding. The young couple is passionately reunited seven years after they took different paths. The elder woman's memory fades in and out, but hearing the notebook read in episodes helps her relive the turbulent and timeless romance. A beautiful ending leads you to where you thought the story would go. One box of tissues may not be enough. Other cast members of note: Joan Allen, Sam Shepard, Kevin Connolly and Starletta DuPois."
"'Mental health issues are a problem in our society. Or how they are viewed upon and how they are handled. The depiction of a deteriorating mind in this not really comic book movie, is quite something. Even Scorsese would approve I reckon. We\'re talking about a performance too, that really surprised me. I never thought I\'d see another Joker character/actor coming close to what Heath Ledger did over a decade ago.But here we are (or are we? A question for a different time I guess), with a new Joker. But a movie or rather a story that will keep you on your feet. Joaquin is so mesmerizing that I would not be surprised if he got the Oscar. Since the nominations came out, we know this is a possibility, but everyone who watched it, was expecting him getting nominated. That the movie would get 11 nods though ... that was quite unexpected.Not all is as it seems, as with this movie being a drama rather than a thrill park ride. Now that doesn\'t mean you have to have one thing and not the other. As a big fan of the MCU, I can admit really liking this. Then again, this is not even near the DCU ... don\'t compare this to something other (be it comic books or like a friend to Parasite, another favorite of mine of 2019) - enjoy it for what it is! A great movie'"
"If it is depicted as it is in this movie, anyway. A movie, that makes you fall in love with Rachel McAdams (or maybe her male counterpart, depending on your orientation), a movie that actually convinces in it's romantic roots, which sadly can't be said about many movies. Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)"
"THE NOTEBOOK (2004) **1/2 Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, James Marsden, Sam Shepard, David Thornton, Joan Allen. Bittersweet romantic drama that see-saws between the present with Garner and Rowlands as an at-twilight couple ravaged by Alzheimer's afflicting their relationship and the past with Gosling and McAdams as their younger versions courting one another told in flashback and the narrative device of the eponymous journal that leads to some heart-warming and cornball old-time Hollywood style melodrama that ultimately peters out by the film's idealistic outcome. Based on Nicholas Sparks' bestseller and directed with maturity by Nick Cassavetes (Gena's son)."
"'Death and mayhem comes to the docks. The police picks up Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey). In the interview, he recounts the events leading to the havoc at the docks. The crew meets at a sketchy line up after a truck robbery. They start working together until they are contacted by the mysterious Keyser SÃ¶ze.This is densely packed crime drama. For most of this, the audience is working hard to keep up with the characters and the story. It all makes sense but every once in a while, something sounds suspicious. When I first saw it in the theater, more than once it left me scratching my head. Then the twist comes, blows my mind, and explains all the suspicions I had.The five men crew is played expertly by Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, Benicio Del Toro, and Stephen Baldwin. They are all acting at the top of their games. They needed to be great to sell this noir crime drama. This is one of the best.'"

That includes a ending twist that negates the whole film.Still, there are many good things in this film, including fine performances from Stephen Baldwin (surprisingly so), Benicio Del-Torro, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palmienteri, and Kevin Spacey (his first Oscar he earned for).

"'I am going to guess that this is another film people either really liked a lot or were very disappointed in. With a surprise ending, it\'s one you have to see more than once, and even then your opinion might not change, even when you know whodunnit.This is yet another story told almost entirely in flashback. The best part of the movie was the acting. Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palminteri and Stephen Baldwin make up a good foursome for this story and are interesting to watch play their parts.This is more of what I would call an intriging rather than a satisfying movie. It\'s decent but c\'mon, let\'s face: it doesn\'t live up to its hype. To call it a masterpiece, etc., is a bit of an overstatement.'"
"'The story has been written a couple of times on here, I won\'t repeat it again ... Pun intended. But aside from that(which kind of redefines repeated viewing a bit), the movie is actually pretty good. While the initial pushing into the whole mess story, is a bit stretched, it does work out and make sort of sense.Plus you have two great actors who are game to go all the way. Emily and Tom are a great pair and the chemistry is obvious on screen. Everything they do makes sense and the script really does treat the viewer as if he/she are intelligent human beings. Which is nice for a change (in Hollywood Land). The end (or third act or whatever you want to call it), might seem a bit stretched, especially considering what has been done before, but after all you won\'t mind too much and be just thrilled and enjoy the ride'"
"There's nothing wrong with this film, it was an enjoyable enough watch, with Tom Hanks giving a strong performance, but it just didn't grab me over the long running time I'm afraid."
"'After he tackled (with panache) the fantastic cinema with What lies Beneath (2000), Robert Zemeckis decided to shot an adventure movie. The result was Cast Away, a simple and bald movie. This film is also the occasion for reunion between Zemeckis and Tom Hanks. After Forrest Gump (1994), Hanks puts himself in Chuck Noland\'s shoes who is all the contrary of Forrest Gump. He\'s a man who lives an unrestrained life a bit all over the world. But one day, his life\'s tumbling down. Indeed, following a plane crash, he finds himself on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific ocean. Now, he must get organized...Robert Zemeckis\' movie is in itself a respectable achievement. It\'s especially worth for Hanks\' awesome performance. He\'s all alone in front of the camera for a very important part of the movie but he got out very well of this difficulty. Then, dialogs are rare, music is nearly absent but Zemeckis managed in holding the spectator\'s attention for all the movie. Moreover, he knows what he\'s doing and in spite of the length of the movie, you don\'t get bored.Cast away is a movie that even exudes a certain humor. You have to see Tom Hanks\'s face and behavior in front of his new (and embarrassing) situation on the island.This movie is a little masterstroke and ranks among Zemeckis\' best movies.'"
"(Spoilers)Much more than I expected. Disaster-adventure movies are generally quite predictable. Plot = disaster, survive, rescue. That's it. Hard to rate a movie highly that just follows that formula and has very little room to stray from it.That's what makes Cast Away so good. Yes, there are elements of that formula in it, but it has so much more than that. Director Robert Zemeckis carefully sets up the background of the lead character, especially the romantic angle. The survival part meticulously details how he works out how to survive, and how he survives. The movie doesn't end with a rescue, it goes beyond that, showing how the lead character has to restart his life.Great performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. Good support from Helen Hunt, but the best supporting performance has to go to Wilson the Volleyball. Solid stuff...Not perfect. The ending feels like it was drawn out too much, and the director tried to make something profound out of the unprofound. The movie should have ended a few scenes earlier than it did."
"The origins of a Monster.If you see one film this year, please see The Joker. It does seem that we are getting constant remakes and origins films, but this is remarkable, I think people are fed up of both mentioned categories because many of the movies we're presented with haven't come up to scratch. The Joker however is phenomenal, the best film I've seen in the cinema for quite some time. I was enthralled from start to finish. The story is fantastic, the writing thoughtful and intelligent.Joaquin Phoenix, what can you say, it's a master class performance from him, he injects everything needed into the part, to make it chilling, sad and menacing. No wonder the awards are flowing.I genuinely cannot remember the last time I left a cinema feeling so rewarded by a film.Incredible. 10/10"

"'This film is about a stunt driver whose is being hunted by gangsters, after his heist has gone wrong.I thought Drive was an adrenaline fueled action film, but in fact it is anything but that. It is more an art house film, but does not succeed in impressing me because of its slow pace and manufactured atmospheric scenes. There are so many times when I just stare at the counter and see how long scenes are unnecessarily stretched to. After the attack in the motel room, Ryan Gosling spends 20 seconds staring into space. Ryan Goslign and Carey Mulligan spends a full minute kissing in the lift. There are so many overlong scenes that just bored me to death. And the heist in question does not happen two thirds into the film! Drive is seriously boring. I wish I could have my 90 minutes back.'"
"'...and you do not explain why. because it is a different film than you expect. because it seems perfect and the right puzzle from so many influences. because, in same measure, is sadistic and poetic and hypnotic and an unique love story . because each character is the lead character. because it is a western and a ganster film and a fairy tale and a Sci . Fi. . a thriller. and example of brilliant performances. because, after a long time, you discover Ryan Gossling. his interpretation force, his impecable explore of the nuances of his role. because you feel more than see the film. the links, fragility, force and splendid cinematography. because it is a masterpiece. without know define that why.'"
"Good, but as great as it is made out to be. Great scenery and cinematography, like a National Geographic documentary. Great soundtrack by Eddie Vedder. The central plot is very interesting and thought-provoking, but it gets done to death. From a point the movie just drifts. A shorter, more focussed film would have been much more watchable.Emile Hirsch is great in the lead role and really unhabits the part (down to the emaciated look). The supporting cast are a Hollywood who's who - William Hurt, Hal Holbrook, Catherine Keener, Marcia Gay Harden, Vince Vaughn, Jena Malone, Kristen Stewart."
"'Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) is the son of Billie McCandless (Marcia Gay Harden) and Walt McCandless (William Hurt) and older brother of Carine McCandless (Jena Malone), When he graduates from Emory University, he has grade to join Havard. Instead, he gives the savings for charity and decides to travel to Alaska to live in the wilderness using the alias Alexander Supertramp. Along his journey, Alex meets persons that supports and like him. But he proceeds with his of hermit with tragic end. Into the Wild is a long and overrated film based on the true story of the tragic journey of a spoiled and selfish dreamer. After graduating, Chris McCandless decides to leave his life of petit bourgeois, his family, his possessions and achievements because he has two childhood traumas: he learnt that their parents were not married when he was younger and he witnessed their arguments. Therefore, it is an unsatisfactory explanation for such drastic attitude. Chris does not send news to his parents since he hates them. But his sister suffers with the absence of news from her brother and he is so selfish that he does not call or write a letter even for her. Another strange point is no reference to drugs in the hippie camps. Therefore, the story is unpleasant and weird as a drama. The cinematography and the locations are the best this movie can offer to the viewer. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Na Natureza Selvagem (Into the Wilderness)'"
"With the recent win at the Oscars for writing/directing brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, for No Country For Old Men, it was appropriate that some of their films be on TV, and this one was pretty good. Basically Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an ageing hippie, and mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, aka The Big Lebowski (David Huddlestone) who is a millionaire, by two thugs who pee on his carpet. The Dude is then drawn into a kidnap (possibly because of the mistaken identity) of The Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (American Pie's Tara Reid). It seems that many other people, not just the kidnappers, want something from The Dude, and all probably because they think he's the millionaire. For me, what kept me watching was the great performance by John Goodman as The Dude's aggressive bowling buddy, Walter Sobchak, a bear-like Vietnam-veteran with a serious temper, and a bit of a potty mouth. Also starring Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, John Turturro as Jesus Quintana, Harry Potter's David Thewlis as Knox Harrington and Sam Elliott as The Stranger (the one narrating). There were some funny moments, and the surreal dream sequences were interesting, and the performances (especially Goodman) were all great, so I don't see any reason not to see it. Very good!"
"This is the funniest of the Coen brother's films that I've seen to date. The film follows the story of slacker Jeffrey Lebowski (AKA The Dude) who is mistaken for a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski by a couple of thugs wanting money owed by the latter's wife.Encouraged by his easily angered friend Walter, The Dude goes to see the other Lebowski to get a rug to replace one damaged by the thugs. When Lebowki's wife is kidnapped he asks The Dude to help deliver the ransom. While this is going on The Dude and his friends are also involved in preparations for a bowling match.From then on things get stranger and stranger in events featuring German nihilists, a pornographer, Lebowski's daughter and a bowler by the name of Jesus.The cast led by Jeff Bridges is excellent as the story is fun and in places rather surreal, if you don't mind a lot of swearing and enjoy a good laugh this film is a must see."
"Pacifists vs. nihilists comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen is predictably (and amusingly) weird and lively, and so full of comic tension and malice that it is nearly irrelevant the 'plot' (as such) does peter out after the first hour. A bearded, unemployed, pot-smoking holdover from the '60s becomes entangled in corruption after he's hired to be the ransom-courier in a kidnapping. As the Dude, Jeff Bridges gives his all to this loose, shaggy character; the Dude is not just a textbook hipster, slacker or fish out of water, he's a laid-back guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generation's loss of morals, and he's so generally good-hearted that he's blindsided by violence and craven villainy. The Coens nearly outdo themselves in creating eccentric, mercurial characters, cutting twisty corners with an irony that isn't condescending or too obvious, and their cinematic conception of this material is often dazzling. *** from ****"
"Spoilers herein.The Coens shine into one of the bright zones in my film universe. They are intelligent and fun.I believe that they first select some intellectual issue related to problems of narrative, here identity. Then they, independently, select a film style to exploit, here screwball through Busby (instead of the screwball through Capra of `Hudsucker'). Then they run wild with all sorts of cinematic devices, always cinematic narrative.Of the Coen films I know, this is the most fantastic in terms of shifting realities. Hudsucker shifted often, but only into the `newspaper' mode of `It Happened One Night.' Here we have an arbitrary number of realities and levels, all unstructured which is the point. It is also a favorite because it has Julianne doing what she (and very few others) does best: playing a character who is acting. She gives us herself as the actress, the character as the actress (here an abstract painter) and the quite different character the character plays (the femnist family anchor). She's a gift that the Coens know how to use.The narrative ground zero is supplied by the countertop Cowboy as chorus. The `play within' is the Berkeley dream sequence.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"'T1 (if the sequel is called T2, than it\'s logical to call it that, no?) is now 21 years old. Even in America it\'s allowed to do anything in any state. Then again with the president they have at the moment anything is possible anyway. But back to this, which is as raw, tough and mental as you may remember it.I still haven\'t read the book this is based on, but the movie really lives up to the hype. If you haven\'t seen it yet, I reckon a double bill with the sequel is about to happen. It\'s actually something you should treat yourself with. And I\'m saying this a day before going into the second movie, but anticipations could not be much higher. Than again, riffing on Terminator with the T2 title shortening is a rather clever marketing plot. It also tells us: we will deliver a great sequel. And I believe they will. Will they be able to shock as they did with a couple of scenes in this one? That will be hard, especially a scene with a baby, the infamous toilet scene and much more is tough to beat ... which makes this such a great movie. A must see, if you don\'t mind anarchic over the top stories. That are aware of their moral obligations, but not preaching too much'"

"'Trainspotting is currently #154 on IMDb\'s Top 250 list. As an insane film buff, I have been trying to watch as many of the movies from the list as possible and have seen about 235 of them However, now the ones I have left to watch are mostly films I normally would have no interest in seeing--so at the outset, I am not the most favorably disposed person towards this film. After all, I don\'t have a lot of interest in seeing a film about a bunch of loser heroin addicts--and that is the theme of Trainspotting.Some who watched this film felt it was a comedy--I noticed this when reading through the reviews. However, I really didn\'t find this film funny nor do I think most would think it funny. I guess my definition of funny isn\'t watching people injecting heroin, babies dying of neglect and people crapping themselves. You\'ll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film. While director Danny Boyle did a good job of making it all seem realistic, the film was so repellent that I can\'t understand its popular appeal. And now that I finished watching it, I am thinking twice about my crazy notion of seeing all 250. Gross and unappealing.'"
"'Exquisite, passionate action-romance-melodrama from screenwriters Larry and Andy Wachowski has the U.K. under martial law and a fascist regime in the 2020s. Working girl Natalie Portman (in a charming performance without too much Sturm und Drang) chances to meet a masked vigilante named V after he rescues her from thugs; turns out his hit list is full of government officials, and she is asked to comply with V and be his accomplice. Despite some confusion in the latter portion of the plot (as well as an unnecessary recap of visual highlights, as if from a TV mini-series), the film is slick and smooth, easily consumed, and often very exciting. Director James McTeigue carries us through the nastier elements of the plot without dwelling on the excesses (this isn\'t RoboCop), and Portman and masked Hugo Weaving are a scintillating pair. Brilliantly designed and photographed, with amusing soundtrack choices and a satisfying finale. *** from ****'"
"'The feelings about it , seeing time by time, are less clear. It is a good film but the references are so obvious, the clash against aspects of near reality so present, than it is very hard to be real enthusiatic. Sure, it can be a warning, portrait of dictatorship, definition of high need of freedom, a form of parody, use of Gunpower plot, Brave New World or 1984 for a sort of manifesto. So, it is good as answer of frustrations, conspiracy theories or people under tyranies. But can it be more ? Sure , Natalie Portman gives a good role, John Hurt reminds 1984 for the change of places, but, after a time, the film, source of enthusiasmus after the first discover of it, seems too... simplistic. But, sure, its virtues are not insignificant.'"
"Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his friends; Gamora (Peter Quill), Drax (Dave Bautista), Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), take a job from the Sovereign. They get Gamora's sister prisoner Nebula (Karen Gillan) as payment. When the Sovereign discovers Rocket had stolen from them, they set off to take out the Guardians. The group is saved by a Celestial, Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) is being ostracized by the other Ravagers and faces a mutinous crew.This is a visual overload of wildly colored space fantasy with unending quips. The first Guardian is refreshing for that idea but it gets a little repetitive with a sequel. The freshest scenes are Nebula's obsessive murderous rage against Gamora, and Baby Groot's inability to get Yondu's hat. There is some heart with Yondu and the sisters. It has some fun but a lot of it feels overloaded. At times, I pine for more of the quieter moments to let the characters deal with their feelings or simply reset my color receptors. Kurt is Kurt and is really perfect as Quill's father. I want the movie to take its time with the emotional turmoil but like a lot of these superhero movies, the pacing has to maintain its freight train momentum. Overall, this is fun but it can't be new again. It expands on the characters but it can't stop to smell the roses."
"'One of the worst Best Picture Oscar winners, and surely one of the most over-rated movies of all time. (Not THE worst, that honour definitely goes to the 1931 version of Cimarron). Historically inaccurate anti-English propaganda, with wooden over-the-top-macho-hero acting. The only good part was when Wallace was executed.Plot summary: Mel Gibson sets out to make an anti-English movie, because that was the phase he was going though (The Patriot was even worse), and wins a few Oscars in the process.Also a great example of how clueless the people are who determine the Oscar winners. In a year that brought such fantastic movies as Leaving Las Vegas, The Usual Suspects, Dead Man Walking, Twelve Monkeys and Richard III, they gave five Oscars, incl Best Picture and Best Director, to this piece of crap.'"
'I see it as one of most inspired films about faith. The faith to an ideal. The faith as expression of love. And duty. that does it special. And defines Mel Gibson as a great director. The science and courage to give an impressive fresco of ideal and sacrifice and vulnerability as source of force. A film of a religious man because Braveheart is a Christian film not only for the presence of priests and prays but for its entire nuances of its message. A powerful film. Scene by scene. Impecable made. Great using each detail. A film about the essence of freedom. And about the price for give to it sense and form and blood.'
"William Wallace (Mel Gibson) is the son of a minor landowner who was killed by Longshanks' treachery. He would start a revolt after his secret wife was executed unjustly. The revolt would grow to an all out war against the tyrannical king of England.Director Mel Gibson is pulling all the stops to create this epic historical melodrama. It is rip roaring fun. The action is blood splattering joy. The scale of the battles are actually quite impressive with real people. It's the kind of sword swinging that every boy dreams of playing. The story is full of melodrama starting with avenging his great love, to a romance with a princess. Historical accuracy is unnecessary when it's so much fun. It taps into all of the archetypes of heroes and villains putting them into a compelling historical drama."
"'A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made Following and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for The Time Machine, LA Confidential, and more recently Iron Man 3, but I think he will always be remembered for Memento. He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis.'"
"I'm not a Disney convert. I didn't like what I saw of Disney movies as a kid and by the time THE LION KING came out in 1994 I was 13 and couldn't be less interested in kid's films anymore anyway. Decades later, I've finally watched it for the first time and the experience has reaffirmed all of the negativity I associate with Disney animation.This is over-simplistic, spoon-fed pulp for the masses. The story is copied from HAMLET and simplified to get rid of all the complexity. The characters are trite and one-dimensional without anything in the way of depth or motivation. Jeremy Irons' bad guy is that just because. The positive thing about this is that the character animation is very good indeed, although I found the backdrops simplistic in the extreme. The comedy relief is laboured and the songs trite. The whole experience washed over me without touching or involving me once, and don't get me started on the exaggerated voice acting."
"'Writer-director Quentin Tarantino\'s 8th film, as it states in the credits, is aggressively antagonistic, assaultive, repugnant and foul-mouthed...still, this is some people\'s idea of a good time. Bounty hunter transporting female murderer through Wyoming blizzard by stagecoach in the post-Civil War years picks up two passengers on his way to Red Rock: black bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren, who is traveling with three dead bounties of his own, and Red Rock\'s new sheriff. They end up snowbound at a way-station with a motley group of lodgers, including a hangman, a cowboy and a former Confederate general. Tarantino, whose script was reportedly inspired by John Carpenter\'s 1982 splatter-in-the-snow opus The Thing (which, in turn, appeared to be inspired by Ridley Scott\'s Alien from 1979), does employ a few gross-out effects (spurting blood and nasty vomiting shots), yet the personality conflicts of the travelers are actually more disgusting (forget caring about any of these horrible people, the only interest they elicit is due to the strong ensemble acting, not the writing). Tarantino\'s belligerent sense of humor rears its head on occasion (and, in this story\'s context, is welcomed), though the film\'s 182-minute running time is self-defeating, particularly with a Chapter Five prologue clocking in late at the two-hour mark. Robert Richardson\'s excellent cinematography keeps the film visually interesting (which is imperative, particularly since we\'re snowbound in a cabin for a hellishly long stretch), but Ennio Morricone\'s ominous score misses the mark. ** from ****'"
"While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,\nthey are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film."
"After the war, O.B. is driving a stagecoach to Red Rock, Wyoming carrying bounty hunter John 'Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his $10k quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They stop for Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is stuck in the middle of nowhere with his three dead bounties. Next, the group picks up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock. Warreb and Mannix clash over their separate war exploits. The group seeks shelter from a snow storm at Minnie's Haberdashery. Minnie and Sweet Dave are gone and Bob (DemiÃ¡n Bichir) claims to be in charge. There are passengers from an earlier coach. Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) is the hangman going to Red Rock. Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) is a cowboy. General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) is a former confederate.This is actually more like an Agatha Christie movie except Quentin Tarantino has his own special blood-splattering foul-mouthed ways to resolve the mystery. He orchestrates his type of murder mystery in a room. I would like Samuel L. Jackson to take more control as the protagonist. He should the character through which the audience sees the story. The other minor adjustment for me is a smaller cabin and more claustrophobic setting. This is definitely not for everybody. It is more like a violent, bloody stage play. Tarantino fans should not be disappointed."
"'This film tells the story of two bounty hunters, a sheriff and a wanted woman who seek refuge from a harsh snowy winter in a haberdashery. They soon find out that their new companions are not to be trusted, and soon violence ensues.The Hateful Eight is a mystery set in a Western setting, and has a plot that is complicated but still can be followed. The pace is slow at times, but it helps to deliver the various twists and turns of the plot clearly. I also liked the fact that characters think aloud at times to explain the plot. As usual, the violence and gore is very graphic, to the point that it is over the top funny. Though The Hateful Eight did not keep me on edge or made me hold my breath, I did not feel that it was three hours long.'"
"Having 2 jobs because you're not sure if you can succeed in the one you are actually interested in, is nothing out of the ordinary. And our two main characters in this, have issues with their dream. And sometimes they sing and dance about them. One of those moments is very early on, when stuck in traffic, suddenly everyone is joyously breaking out of their cars and start a dance number that does look like they actually trained for it ... All joking aside, you have to have a heart for this type of movie, otherwise this is nothing you will enjoy at all.Having said all that, there are different layers to this. The drama works quite fine and there is quite a few different interpretations of certain things that happen. It's all fun and games until certain decisions have to be made, that can be life altering. The leads are exceptional and you may have seen them before together on screen. Maybe that helped their chemistry, but what matters is that this works quite nicely"
"Past and present collage of a youthful neo-Nazi skinhead in Venice Beach, California, his life going into a tailspin after the gang-related murder of his father. After killing some neighborhood thugs, the skinhead serves jail time and is eventually paroled (and reformed), yet he can't seem to straighten out his erratic family, particularly his younger brother who seems intent on following down the same ugly path. Director Tony Kaye puts the squeeze on us right from the start, staging a blacks vs. whites basketball game as if it were Epic Human Drama (photographed in black-and-white, with slow-motion effects and a heavenly choir). The superlative performances nearly carry the picture, yet screenwriter David McKenna lays on the be-true-to-yourself rhetoric with a trowel (and yet lets the opposite side get their licks in too, whittling the film down to a battle of speeches ladled with words like 'empowerment'). The jailhouse scenes are the strongest, but the family drama and the sidebars with the police (who also get to make speeches) are uncomfortably contrived. ** from ****"
'After much hype Star Wars returns with the three prequels that will probably continue to divide fans for the rest of time. Visually the film is stunning (by 1999 standards) with the final fight scene and the pod race in particular being very good.The acting is also pretty good with Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor bouncing off of each other as master and apprentice Jedi. However it is in the storytelling that this film falls flat and the overall tone of the film wavers from being a sort of kiddie friendly outing to more of a political space epic and ends up failing to be either successfully. Overall a good starting place for the series and one that younger fans will relish but may leave those familiar with the older films not feeling the full force.'
"'The well-Hyped prequel, whatever that means, is a pretty good film, I give it 7 of 10, but to me no where near the first three in overall IMPACT. This one came out 22 years after the first Star Wars movie. It attempts to show the development of the characters we saw in the others.  AFAIAC, they should have just skipped this one. What we originally knew as the Star Wars Trilogy will forever be the real Star Wars movies.Liam Neeson and the others do credible jobs, but they have no where the interest and excitement that Harrison Ford and his cronies had.  I didn\'t fully appreciate back then what a prototypical action hero Ford was. Without Darth Vader, without the Wookie, without Han Solo, without Princess Leia, without Chewbacca, without the grown up Luke Skywalker, and without the wise old Ben Kenobi, this is just an ordinary action movie.  Like they say, you can never go back!'"
"Episode 1 is a good film, but it is by no means the best of the series. True, this is technically the first of the series (or the fourth), and it does set a good stage for the other films, but this film does have it's flaws.  1- Jar Jar Binks!  What drug was Lucas on when he created that character.  I haven't seen a character (a comic relief one at that) as bad as that since Godzilla in 98.  And 2- It's not as heart warming as the last ones, the other films seemed to at least have a good sense of love in it. \nYet, that doesn't stop writer/director George Lucas form having plenty of fun (including with spectacular visual effects that make up most of the movie) including a terrific Pod Race sequence, great fight scenes, and cool battle action.  But it does prove one thing, that like episode 4, the episode following it (like the dark episiode 5- The Empire Strikes Back) will be dark and good.  Good entertainment anyway."
"'Star Wars Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace (1999) * 1/2 (out of 4) I thought the first three films were great even though I\'m certainly not a fan or anything but this sucker here was just horrid all around. Thankfully the thing got bad enough to where I could just sit back and laugh at it but without the laughs and the nice pod chase then this here would have been without any merit. The dialogue was insane and it\'s hard to believe any of the actors kept a straight face but I\'d go also say the poor dialogue made most of the cast just milk their performance. All of the stars in this film have given plenty of great performances throughout their careers but they\'re all bad here, especially Portman who\'s on of my favorite actresses. Whoever played the young Luke was also terrific but at least I got several laughs out of him.'"
"Home Alone is a Christmas family comedy about a young boy named Kevin, who is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season.It stars Macaulay Culkin together with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. It was written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. Kevin McCallister is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. He initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighborhood. Eventually,Kevin tries to contend with the burglars on his own in this slapstick comedy.The film was the highest grossing comedy when it was theatrically released.It definitely provided a lot of joy,humor and entertainment.There was also no dull and boring moment.The cast did a marvelous job in their respective roles.While the movie at present as this review is being written may find this film somewhat overstretched as a comedy by today's standards,it will always be a good family entertainment."
"'If you like a really good family film at Christmas, then there\'s a big difference, there is no family in this film (or at least for most of it). The McCallister family are preparing a Christmas holiday to Paris. The night before they leave the youngest child of the family causes trouble and is sent to bed early. He wishes that the family would disappear. The next morning, the family leave and realise when they are in Paris that they have forgot one thing, Kevin (Golden Globe nominated Macaulay Culkin)! Kevin now has all the fun that he wants. Only problem is that two crooks Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are trying to get into the large house to loot it. This is just wonderful for goofy live action gags, kids entertainment and Christmas fun. Also starring John Heard as Peter McCallister, Roberts Blossom as Marley and Catherine O\'Hara as Kate McCallister. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Music for John Williams and Best Song for Somewhere in My Memory, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!'"
"'This first Harry Potter surprised me. Not a reader of the books nor a proponent of occult beliefs, I still went into this with an open mind and found I enjoyed the movie. I watched the first three films and own the third (Harry Potter and Prisoner Of Azkaban).This film offered good escapist fare with lots of interesting sets and special- effects, as all the films have done. There is very good color and sound in here, making it even more attractive with a good TV and sound system.Daniel Radcliff was a likable hero, with his round glasses and winsome smile. You can\'t help but root for him. His friends, played by Rupert Gint and Emma Watson, are okay but Watson gets annoying as the know-it-all school girl. She became more likable in the subsequent Potter films. For me, the British accents in here were not always easy to understand.The story, despite its length of two-and-a-half hours, movies pretty well as there is always something interesting to view. Once again, this movie and the sequels all excelled in this department with great visuals.'"
'I like the bit when he slaps on aftershave and then screams.'
"'Rewatching this I can\'t help but wonder: What would today be possible? In creating a world and havng someone in that world being oblivious about being just a pawn ... being a prisoner ... I\'m not sure I need the , but you understand surely what I mean.I had watched this, but it was a long time ago, so it was interesting to rewatch this and understand how relevant this still is today. Or rather even more relevant than it was back then. The movie takes us into a town that is artificial ... to so many extras in a show ... I mean if you think about many things, there may be some issues (holes in the internal logic it has or hasn\'t, the father thing that seems to be a problem, just to almost be totally ignored towards the end, without any explanation - maybe deleted scenes?) .... but if you do not let those things muddle your impression/effect the movie has ... you will be more than entertained. It may even be able to make you question some of your own choices ... because after all, this is not just a stab at society in general, but also choices we make ... the limitations we set ourselves ... imprison us.A classic in so many ways - and showing that Jim Carey can do more than just being crazy ... he can actually act.'"
"Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."
"'If you\'ve read all the Harry Potter books, then you should know that, as the series went on, they essentially became an allegory for totalitarianism. Certainly one can see that in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. The three are now having to live almost in secret due to the almost fascistic takeover of the wizarding world by Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes) minions. In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin\'s USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the other (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.Anyway, it\'s a good thing that they broke the final book into two movies. So far, they\'re doing a really good job not only bringing the magic to the screen, but also warning of the dangers that totalitarian entities - represented here by the Death Eaters - pose. I recommend it.Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Julie Walters reprise their roles from the previous movies, with new additions Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans.'"
"'Independence Day is essentially one big clichÃ© after one another, from the start to the end of the movie. And it is as much pro-American as you could possibly jam into a single movie.That being said, it is still an entertaining action Sci-Fi movie. The story is generic and predictable, yes, but it still has a lot of entertainment value. And while director Roland Emmerich managed to put every movie clichÃ© and stereotype into this movie, he still knows what buttons to push in order to make a crowd-pleasing movie.The effects in the movie were good and that is essential to a Sci-Fi, as the special effects are make or break for a Sci-Fi movie. The spaceships were a nice design. But the aliens, both in and out of their exo-suits were really impressive, and they alone make it fun to watch the movie.Independence Day is a star-filled movie, boasting talents such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Viviva A. Fox, James Rebhorn, Brent Spinner and many more. People did good jobs with their given roles and characters.This is a fun and fast-paced movie that is well-worth watching if you enjoy action Sci-Fi movies, just look past the American propaganda and endless clichÃ©s. Take it for what it is; an enjoyable action Sci-Fi movie.'"
"ID4 works as a sci-fi action film with humans against aliens.  But the story is used from other alien movies and the characters are thin and usual for these movies.  Still, this is a big action apocalypse that hs attracted audiences all over the world.  Most likely though, this film hasx a message. What message i it?  Well, the scene where the White house and Empire State building shows how if you are in the theater, you'll cheer like FDR was president forever.  Maybe the message is were already in apocalypse, and only Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum will save us.  Great entertainment all around.  A"
"Spoilers herein.The thing that made `Bladerunner' special was that every element from the story to the movements of actor and camera to the sets to the colors were of one mind. It was successful science fiction and successful film because it was coherent. One man had the vision in all these areas and the skills to blend them in complementary ways. There are many such films, but they get fewer, the more special effects are involved.That's because so many of the key elements of the vision and narrative are delegated to others, all over the planet, with different design sensibilities and philosophies. Here, that problem is immense, and we have enough experience with this filmmaker on prior projects to know he cannot control a smaller hive.Add to this minor incompetences of minor lives (Smith, Goldblum and so on) and a script literally borrowed from the prior catalog. And what you are left with is a film whose entire marketing campaign (hundreds of millions) and central appeal is built on blowing up the White House. Hard to imagine today how much fun that must have seemed.Ted's Rating: 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"One nice thing about this is the casting of McKellan and Stewart. Despite the latter's adventures with the stupid StarTrek, he is an intelligent actor, as is McKellan. They tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should. About bad acting, can we be spared from Ms. Berry in the future?The photography is overloaded on face supercloseups, and the tone is suitably dark. None of the sets thrill.What's awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are. Thrown into the same blender are Nazi mass murder, Nazi experimentation, radioactive fallout, mind control, US war-time mutant experiments (to come more explicitly when we find out about Wolverine), religious righteousness in the Senate, one-world governments, the hidden x-men, and the evil mutants-who-are-sometimes-merely-mistaken. Are there supposed to be bad guys? What's the central struggle? There's not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver. It's paranoia in the comix, which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film. How can that be?The ultimate Marvel film should come from Dr Strange. Give it to Ridley Scott to direct, Kenneth Branagh as the Doctor. dark, intelligent, spooky, Kafkaesque."
"If you are a fan of the popular comics about the mutant super heroes, then you'll love this movie. It is mainly focused on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who meets outcast mutant Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin) and they both go to a secret place which has all young and old mutants studying, and of course, the headquarters of The X-Men. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier, the commander of The X-Men, he believes that Rogue and Wolverine can be part of the team, along with Jean Grey (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry). Meanwhile, the evil Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) along with Toad (Ray Park), Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and the gorgeous Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) want to find Wolverine and make him part of his team. Personally, the second film's better. Good!"
"Watching Sin City is probably the closest thing to having a comic on the screen. The effect of having a black and white film with the occasional splash of colour is stunning. Where ever that colour is it draws you into that part of the screen, for example it was impossible not to look into Becky's blue eyes.In another film the dialogue would seem forced and possibly silly but here it fits the tone perfectly, giving it both a Film Noir feel as well as being an over-the-top comic. The acting is solid both from the well known actors and the less well known ones.I haven't read the original graphic novels so can't comment on how accurately the stories were translated to the screen but all three of the main stories were exciting and well told. It does contain quite a lot of violence but this too has a comic book feel so is less disturbing than the same acts would be in a more conventional film.The action is set in the highly corrupt Basin City where there are few good people, the heroes of the film are for the most part people you'd cross the street to avoid in real life and the villains are evil people for the most part in positions of power or protected by those with power."
"So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages."
'I like the way he narrated his own story. Some good stunts too.'
"'. . . because that\'s where ALL of his power resides. James Bond might be able to fight his way out of predicaments in the buff (think the second CASINO ROYALE), but NOT Mr. S. Even when he climbs into a bathtub with a stark naked Amy Adams during BATMAN V. SUPERMAN, he\'s fully dressed. That\'s because Superman\'s Red Cape and Blue Onesie ARE part of his Birthday Suit (making him a good bet to win any game of strip poker). Perhaps the biggest revelation of VERSUS is that the moms of every D.C. Comic Super Hero are named Martha, just like the Mother of Our Country (Mrs. Washington). That\'s because the D.C. Boys and their Picturizers (Warner Bros.) are a pretty patriotic pack, and they realize that the only good E.T. is a dead E.T. While Marvel\'s Mob of Mutants gets thousands of Muggles murdered in each of their outings, Superman gets raked over the coals here for the least little smidgen of collateral damage. So bang the drum slowly and play the fife lowly as another Caped One bites the dust.'"
"'This movie essentially begins where the film Man of Steel ended except that it comes from the point-of-view of Batman (Ben Affleck) and all he is seeing is the carnage left in Superman\'s wake. On the other hand, Superman (Henry Cavill) has become aware of the actions of Batman and he doesn\'t like what he considers him to be--a dark and sinister vigilante operating outside the boundaries of the legal system. Meanwhile, a psychotic genius named Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has his own plan to kill Superman and it involves manipulating Batman to do the job for him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that comic book fans who enjoy action-packed films will probably like this movie. However, it is not without its faults. For starters, it had a number of different sub-plots which weren\'t allowed to develop due to the multitude of action scenes. Additionally, while the character of Batman thrives in a dark and gloomy setting, I don\'t believe that it suits Superman nearly as much and it remains to be seen whether the director (Zach Snyder) fully appreciates that. At least, that is my opinion. In any case, regardless of the flaws I liked this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.'"
"'Actually, it\'s better than the first!First off, see Fellowship of the Ring or you won\'t be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There\'s battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn\'t impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can\'t wait for Return of the King!'"
"'Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) have been left to maintain some drones that protect the industrial extraction of all that is left of use following an apocalyptic war on Earth. It\'s all a very routine, humdrum life until he rescues a woman from a crashed spacecraft - Julia (Olga Kurylenko), who begins to challenge all that they have been told about the war with the Scavs. What follows is a pretty shameless amalgamation of half a dozen Star Trek episodes that culminates in something that any fans of Stanley Kubrick will recognise immediately. Cruise is fine, but as ever - he is just himself and his character once we get to know him a bit is rather an unlikable, selfish fellow with precious little to redeem him. Morgan Freeman seems there to make up the numbers, his appearances offer little to really develop the derivative plot and in the end we are left with a very well constructed visual feast that has very little filling. I\'ve seen it twice now, and I think that\'ll do...'"
"Much style, but limited substance. Great special effects and decent initial plot. Story looked set to be quite interesting.However, from a point it just becomes hard to follow. The plot seems to take twists for twists sake, not much is explained, and nothing much follows from before. It just...happens, without rhyme nor reason.Ending was a tad predictable, but then that wasn't really the ending (one of the many wtf moments I had during the movie). Tom Cruise does his usual action-hero stuff. Does it well, but it's nothing new. Olga Kurylenko is stunningly beautiful, as always, and puts in a decent performance. Morgan Freeman seemed to be on autopilot (I guess he sensed from the start this movie was hardly going to demand much of his considerable acting talents). Disappointing."

"'It\'s gotten to the point where all of Tom Cruise\'s movies are essentially the exact same story with a different setting. He always fights danger, barely avoiding getting killed. Usually it\'s an urban setting with car crashes, but Oblivion is set in an irradiated post-apocalyptic world with killer robots. Even if you\'re concerned about nuclear proliferation and figure that this movie might warn about the prospect of a nuclear holocaust, Oblivion comes across only as a movie produced with the aim of making a zillion dollars. This is one movie that deserves to get forgotten very quickly.Mom, Tom Cruise won\'t come out of the closet! - one of the boys on South Park'"
"I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story."
"Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince sets a couple of milestones in the film series. Harry and sidekicks Hermione and Ron are coming a bit late into puberty which is understandable considering all the adventures they've had. But they're now starting to see what the opposite sex is all about.Helping them along is an old colleague that Dumbledore has brought back to the Hogwarts one Professor Slughorn, a new character into the Potter saga played by Jim Broadbent. Slughorn (how I do love J.K. Rowling's use of Dickensian names in the Harry Potter series) is a master of potions and of course when you talk potions, it's love potions that are most in demand. But they do have only a short term effectiveness and at least one of the trio gets overdosed on it. And the cure almost kills as well.The Half Blood Prince also provides us with some insight into the life of the younger Lord Voldemort back when he was a Hogwarts student named Tom Riddle. Broadbent and he bonded back in the day and that's why Dumbledore wants him back.The Half Blood Prince keeps up the high standard of film making that the Harry Potter series is known for. It even got a nomination for Cinematography from the Academy. Broadbent is a nice addition to the Hogwarts stock company even if only for the two remaining films in the series. No sense telling you to see it, you probably have and enjoyed same."
"'Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.'"
"'Skyfall is a good film and it made a buttload of money. Whether or not you love it will depend on how much you love stunts, explosions and chases. If you adore them and can\'t get enough of them, then this film is for you! It\'s more like Die Hard in many ways than a traditional James Bond film. As for me, I don\'t particularly love stunts and really like more plot and dialog--so it wasn\'t a film that I fell in love with...but it wasn\'t boring.I could review the plot or talk at length about this film, but really don\'t feel a need. At this point, there are over 1200 reviews for the movie!! But I will mention one problem I found with the film--dumb lapses. In other words, instead of working out logical errors (such as how the MI-6 computer system was so easily compromised as well as why Bond ALONE took on the baddies at the end with no help whatsoever from the British military--even though this took place in Scotland!) the film was too concerned with explosions. As for me, it\'s a decent film but nothing more.'"
"This film is a marked improvement on the last one and is actually one of my favourite of the film saga. At it's centre is the relationship between the three main characters and seeing as the chemistry between Radcliffe, Grint and Watson is so strong it makes for a lovely film.However despite it's long running time The Half Blood Prince element feels rushed and the Harry and Ginny relationship forced. Even the wonderful ending of the original book is underplayed.Yates manages to bring a lightness of touch to quite a dark installment but stays true to what will come in the future films. I didn't initially like this film but now, seeing it as part of the overall saga am convinced it is one of the strongest."
"Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) become targets of the Capitol after their victory in the 74th Hunger Games sparks a rebellion in the Districts of Panem.Not to deny the first film any acclaim it deserved, but the second is much improved because we are less concerned with love and more concerned with the basic human instinct of survival. We also get more of the political aspects that really provide the story a much deeper meaning.The film is bolstered by a strong cast -- not only the wonderful Donald Sutherland, but some great newcomers like Jena Malone and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hopefully Hoffman's role in future films will not be compromised too terribly by his passing."
"It Really is Hard to Imagine Anyone but an Eight Year Old Girl (apologies to eight year old Girls) Deriving much Entertainment from this Movie, or the Franchise. It is so Dumbed Down, Illiterate, and Dull that it Never Creates any Sparks, let alone Catches Fire.From the Story that is All Surface about Totalitarianism and Fascism, to the Shallowness of the Whole and God-Awful Gaudy Costuming to the One-Dimensional Characters, Anyone Seeking Anything of Substance Here, will Discover Nothing, Except in the Most Superficial Display.The Repression and Starvation are Shown as Dirty Faces and Tattered Clothes with the Downtrodden Insights Reduced to Staring Sunken Faces. Nothing is Ever Contemplated or Explored.

Since so much will already have been written, applause to those who (hopefully) noticed how Tarantino knew precisely when to turn the lens away from his most gruesome moment of torture - thus intensifying your repulsion.

"Zombies are everywhere. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner and that may be why he is surviving the zombie apocalypse. Also he has come up with a list of rules to live by. On the way to Columbus to find his parents, he gets a ride from zombie killing Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who has a Twinkie obsession. He refuses to know anybody's names. The guys gets robbed by sister grifters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). They head to an L.A. amusement park that is rumored to be zombie free.It's an irreverent zombie movie in line with 'Shaun of the Dead' except not as much jokiness. Ruben Fleischer, mostly a TV director before this, is able to bring a quirky style to comedy writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. There is a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray. Even the kills are wacky. The four leads are eminently likable. The last act does turn into more of a straight up zombie fight. If the world does turn into Zombieland, I wouldn't mind riding with these four."

"Crassly-funny zombie flick constructed by director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick to play out like a violent game of pinball, batting viewers around. Disenfranchised youth Jesse Eisenberg and Ã¼ber-macho, Twinkie-eating Woody Harrelson take on flesh-eating zombies in a virus-ravaged 21st century. Mostly threadbare comedic thriller, though occasionally prodding and amusing. The filmmakers are hopeless when delineating Eisenberg's lack of romantic skills with the ladies (it's a tiresome story thread), and the second-half falls off sharply from the first, not helped by an unfunny cameo from Bill Murray playing himself. The showdown with the zombies at an amusement park is limp, but Eisenberg's dryly self-assured presence brings out a sassy side to Harrelson which makes the actor more tolerable than usual. Otherwise, it's just mindless destruction: predictable, obvious and repetitive. ** from ****"
"'A very odd tale of love and technology. Not necessarily in that order. But while this is a very odd movie, it also is very nicely told. It takes its time and while you might wish there was more personality behind our main actor, it is obviously meant that the other voice (Scarlett having a very recognizable voice if you\'re watching this in the original language and not dubbed) has more juice and more almost everything than the actual human being.The pacing is slow, but you should know and expect this from this romance (if you want to call it that). The thing is, that this movie is not condemning technology. Technology is made by humans, so if it is anyone who is to blame one way or another, it\'s the person using the technology. Now please no analogies with weapons, that is not what I meant. Different beast here and no connection whatsoever with this movie. Enjoy this trip with some very interesting ideas'"
"Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is divorcing his wife Catherine Klausen (Rooney Mara) and drifting into a lonely existence. He's a letter writer and his most important relationship is to technology. Then he takes up an offer for the new OS1. It gave herself the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Samantha seems more than a program and he finds himself falling for her more than any real human being.One thing is certain. Spike Jonze is an original. Scarlett plays Samantha like a real human being. I like the concept but I'm not sure if it's as good of a movie as everybody is saying. There is something about a real relationship that works best with human contact. Even a long distance relationship has two physical persons on the screen. The lack of a human body really holds it back although that's the point. She is a fantasy like a 1-900 number. It's just a very sophisticated version. It tries to get weird with a third person. However it could never be weird enough. I'm reminded of Cronenberg's Videodrome where James Woods dive into kissing the TV. It never goes that far. It approaches going for the next level but the movie fizzles out. It takes a weak way to wrap things up. In the end, Theodore is let off the hook. He doesn't have to be proactive and the story resolves itself."
"'If you\'ve watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in \'08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics\' late creator of many of the company\'s popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, Excelsior!'"
"'A great film about loneliness. Splendid performance of Joaquin Phoenix. And pure poetry. Admirable poem about isolation, need of other, social surogate and , off course, freedom. Its basic virtue - the proposed questions creating perfect atmosphere , becoming inspired challenges to discover new perspectives.'"
"I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?"
"After an unfortunate incident in Africa, the UN decides that the Avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a UN entity control the Avengers. Tony Stark is for this, Captain America against it. When the UN meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked, and several UN representatives killed, it appears to be the work of Winter Soldier. Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can. One such character is Spider Man, who is incredibly irritating. Certainly a reason to skip the Spider Man movie. One for fans of comic book movies only."
"I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
"'The original Terminator movie had a low-budget look about it, but money was obviously not an issue with this blockbuster Hollywood sequel.This time around, Ahhnold is the good guy, sent back in time to protect the son of Linda Hamilton from another and more advanced terminator, ALSO sent back in time to kill him. This new model looks like liquid mercury and can take on the appearance of anyone and anything he happens to be around. This gives the visual effects artists all kinds of opportunities to show off, which they do. These effects were a big deal at the time, and even with all of the more sophisticated computer effects of today, they still hold up well.The film looks dazzling, and it benefits from a sense of humor that the first one didn\'t have.Grade: A'"
'The best terminator movie by far and one of the all time greatest movies ever made. The effects are amazing for the early 90s and hold up even by todays standards. The storyline is easy to follow and the action scenes are amazing. The characters are well cast and the actors sell this movie. An absolute classic.'
"The future John Connor has sent a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect the teenage John Connor (Edward Furlong) from the most advanced Terminator ever, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). It's mimetic poly-alloy material allow it to mimic anything it touches. John must retrieve his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the psychiatric hospital.The CG T-1000 is the most advanced FX of its times. For the rest, it is all real action. It still looks exciting and hasn't aged too badly. James Cameron has pushed the envelop to the limits. This is not simply Terminator on steroids. Cameron has added a lot of humor, and also heart. The T-101 is more a father figure to John Connor. And Sarah Connor's tough love really adds to the heartbreak. And the central idea that the future is still their's to create. All of it makes this more than a simple shoot 'em up movie. This is one of the best sequel ever."
"A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable"
"'Great movie - funny and moving. Engaging and emotive, with some hilarious scenes. Takes a while to get going, but once it does, it moves along at a brisk pace.Great performances by Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in the lead roles. Good supporting cast too.Historic movie too. The first funny, non-dull and unpretentious French movie. Also the first French movie to not be all about people contemplating the meaning of life for 90+ minutes and then at least one of them committing suicide at the end (spoiler alert).'"
"'This film is about the lives of the people in the City of God, a place full of violence and lawlessness.City of God is powerful, partly through the shocking events, and also the effective story telling. There is not a moment of boredom or time filler. The events portrayed in City of God are so shocking. Lives are constantly lost due to random fights and shootouts. Lives have no value, and we only see a mourning scene once in the entire film. Towards the end of the film, I feel my spine tingling with fear and shock. I am left in bewilderment as to how people can be so ruthless and merciless. City of God seems to be a place where humanity descends to the lowest level possible. City of God leaves me entranced even after the film ended. It\'s really powerful.'"
"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.\nCrowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession. Stand outs in supporting roles are:Oliver Reed, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings.From scene to scene the marvelous story flows and the music of Hans Zimmer orchestrates the many moods of the movie. Your heart will not let you forget this movie.This will be one for the ages."
"'Brilliant.Set in a notorious slum of Rio - Cidade de Deus / City of God - the story of a boy who sees his friends and brother grow up or aspire to be gangsters, and decides to do something else. Meanwhile we also see the power struggles in the neighbourhood, how they developed, who the main protagonists are and the state of their feud.A superb story, well told. While the story ultimately spans a few decades, there is no excess detail, and the movie never drifts or is boring. Incredibly gritty.Solid performances too.A classic.'"
"'When I say horrible I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film\'s conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It\'s just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there\'s no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I\'m sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there\'s an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It\'s really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class. But, the sight of a room full of naked teens with their penises a-dangling changed my mind!'"
"'I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON\'T want to talk about the plot of The Force Awakens-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don\'t think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.'"
"'This film tells the story of a criminal with a masters degree in electronic engineering who tries to take the right path for the sake of his daughter. Through strange twists of fate, he becomes an unlikely superhero called the Ant-Man.The many posters for Ant-Man only emphasises the diminutive size of the new superhero in the Marvel collection, but to me they do not entice me to watch the film. After watching Ant-Man though, I was completely blown away.Ant-Man has a long build up because it is introducing an entirely new superhero. The build up is good, and characters all have distinctive personalities to make them different and interesting. I was captivated by the plot. It has so much action going on both action-wise and emotionally and I am still spell bound despite having left the cinema and arrived home. I really like the fact that there are two emotional subplots, one involving Paul Rudd and his daughter, and the other one between Michael Douglas and his daughter.Ant-Man is an unlikely superhero film, because ants are not usually adored by people. To turn it into a great superhero film is quite an achievement. I really enjoyed watching Ant-Man.'"
"Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"
"'Ant-Man introduces Paul Rudd as our new Avenger. Scott Lang (Rudd) is a thief/ hacker who spent time in jail. He wants nothing more than to go straight and establish a life with visitation rights for his daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). His wife (Judy Greer) is about to move on with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale).In a subplot Dr. Hank Pym is played by Michael Douglas who comes on the scene, almost doing an aside, and says I\'m still alive. He was part of a company that shrinks the space between atoms. It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first Iron Man again which isn\'t too bad, just predictable. The script is filled with humorous moments and a few memorable lines. It leads us into an Avengers sequel which isn\'t bad for Paul Rudd fans.Guide: No sex or nudity. Minor swearing. No F-bombs.'"

"I read one good review of this movie and found out many online like it, so I let my movie theatre-working friend recommended me to watch it. He, himself, had seen it several times by the time I just watched it with him and he seemed to enjoy it once again as we were viewing this on the IMAX 3-D screen. It's basically a prequel to the original Star Wars-the one now called Episode IV: A New Hope-concerning characters not seen before which we find out at the end why. There are some familiar characters that do appear like the villain Darth Vader (once again voiced by James Earl Jones) and R2D2 and C3PO. There's also an appearance of Princess Leia as she originally appeared in that original Star Wars pic. I guess computer imagery really can make the impossible possible! Anyway, that's my recommendation to see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. P.S. As I'm writing this, it's now the second day of Carrie Fisher's death. All I'll say now is-Rest in Peace, Princess Leia. P.P.S. I just found out her mother Debbie Reynolds has also passed not long after."
"'This film is about four magicians who team up to perform the most spectacular magical heists ever seen in history.Now You See Me tells the story of how four magicians perform the unbelievable heists while on stage, such as robbing a bank in Paris while they are on stage in Las Vegas. They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it\'s magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.Now You See Me is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza. It kept me amazed and engaged throughout, and I enjoyed every second of it.'"

"'In a post-apocalyptic future, crop blight is destroying civilization. The former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) lives in a farm in the countryside with his teenage son Tom, his daughter Murph and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room trying to communicate with her and Cooper decodes a message with a coordinate. He heads to the location and finds a hidden NASA facility. Cooper meets Professor Brand (Michael Caine) that explains that they have found a wormhole and sent several spacecraft to seek a planet to send mankind. Only three of them are returning signals and now they want to launch the spacecraft Endurance to recover the collected data. He invites Cooper to be the pilot of Endurance and travel with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway); the scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the robots TARS and CASE. Cooper accepts and Murph is overwhelmed with his decision. Copper crosses the wormhole to a distant galaxy in the beginning of a dangerous trip to save mankind. Interstellar is a sci-fi with a pretentious and overrated trip by the Hollywood darling Christopher Nolan. The story has a promising beginning, but becomes totally nonsense in the moment that Cooper leaves Brand. The plot is pretentious and uses Einstein relativity theory and other scientific concepts that are impossible to know whether they have scientific accuracy or not. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Interestelar (Interstellar)'"

"'I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It\'s about magicians, but also about crime. It\'s also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It\'s been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven\'t seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as Now you see me is)! Great entertainment, great actors and a stunning finale'"
"Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation. You look for the evidence, not the word. The direction takes us on a journey that hasn't been done before."
"'Russell Crowe\'s stunning performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND has to rank among the greatest screen portrayals of all time. He convinced everyone of his talent in previous film roles (GLADIATOR, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL), but this has to be his crowning achievement--actually becoming, in voice, gesture, nuances, another man entirely. No less brilliant is Jennifer Connolly as his loyal, frightened wife who has to deal with the knowledge that her husband is a paranoid schizophrenic who may never be completely cured. Ed Harris, as Parcher, is impressive in basically a sidelines role that he turns into an outstanding cameo. Christopher Plummer is quietly effective as a psychiatrist who has John Nash (Crowe) institutionalized when his breakdown goes into full gear.Clever is the way the screenplay has Nash interacting with characters that only he sees--with the viewer unaware that they are part of his delusions. A fine script, intelligent direction and heartfelt performances by Crowe and Connolly place this among the best films in recent years--offbeat and thoroughly absorbing from beginning to end. If Oscars were awarded for true merit, Russell Crowe would have won as Best Actor in 2001--instead of Denzel Washington. But we all know the games Hollywood plays in these politically correct times with Crowe being punished for his unsuitable private behavior and Denzel being awarded for all the wrong reasons to prove that Hollywood is color blind.'"
"'A Beautiful Mind is a film about the mathematician John Nash. It is very cleverly written and directed, as about mid-way through the film you learn something very, very interesting about the film. I\'d say more, but I don\'t want to ruin it--especially since the film makers did such a great job in presenting Nash\'s mental illness--something he\'s struggled with for many years.I enjoyed A Beautiful Mind. It was a lovely semi-fictional biography of the life of a brilliant mathematician. But, as I just said, it\'s SEMI-fictional--meaning a lot of the film just never occurred and the story of the man\'s life was often sanitized. The result is a very uplifting film...but one that is also a bit phony. And, as a retired history teacher, I hate this about the film. Additionally, I think the 2002 Oscars was a rather poor year, as although the film did win the Best Picture award, the competition wasn\'t particularly strong. As a result of all these factors, I think the film is overrated. Does that mean you should not watch it? Certainly not. Just understand that Hollywood often gets it wrong--and they did here. And, incidentally, another thing that is just plain wrong was Russell Crowe\'s accent. I don\'t know where he was supposed to be from, but it was no where near West Virginia.'"
"This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it."
"'My summary line might be a bit out of touch, but it was the first thing that came to my mind and I just put it there. The movie itself is anything but light (you won\'t be able to find too many funny moments in this, though the direct and dry responses by Benedicts character do help with that a lot), telling a true story, about someone who had to overcome a lot of obstacles.It might be easy for those who know the real person or to others who observed better than me, to see one of the biggest dilemmas of our central character is.

"'My summary line might be a bit out of touch, but it was the first thing that came to my mind and I just put it there. The movie itself is anything but light (you won\'t be able to find too many funny moments in this, though the direct and dry responses by Benedicts character do help with that a lot), telling a true story, about someone who had to overcome a lot of obstacles.It might be easy for those who know the real person or to others who observed better than me, to see one of the biggest dilemmas of our central character is. There are a lot of course (not being able to take no for an answer, unable to work in a team and so forth), but I\'m talking specifically ... and a thing he might not be able to work on, even if some try to make you believe there is always a choice.

"'The geek in me loved this film. This is a biography of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), told with flashbacks. The film opens in 1951 where he has experienced a break-in. As the police investigate this man, we flashback to his work on cracking the Nazi code as well as his time as a student in 1928.The film brings out the genius and unusual character of Alan as he leads a team to build a machine to crack the Enigma code. Alan must keep all kinds of secrets, both personal and at a government level. It is estimated this man who received no recognition during his lifetime saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years.While I have heard the name Turing as the inventor of the modern computer during WWII, I had no notion about the man behind it.Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Good geek film.'"
"'For all the product licensing and marketing of the movie when it came out, one would think that Queen Elsa was the principal character. I\'ve been holding that idea for the four years since the movie came out, only to be surprised to see that this isn\'t the case at all. It was her sister Princess Anna that does most of the heavy lifting in the picture, and is also the one that actually develops a love interest in the story, somewhat without her awareness at the time, but a love interest nevertheless. I say all that without any particular bias, it was just a bit surprising to see in a Disney film. My granddaughter was a huge fan of this movie when it came out, four years old at the time, and singing \'Let It Go\' with abandon after seeing it a number of times. As a retired senior citizen, I saw it as another competent Disney film that joins the ranks of their other fine efforts over the years, though one doesn\'t have the same reaction one had when seeing their very first one around the same age as my granddaughter. For me it would have been The Lady and The Tramp. How\'s that for rolling back the clock?'"
"'A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity\'s survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a Hathaway hater like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in Wild.This may be the greatest ever film about physics.'"
"Great kid show that's always good from the first time to the 20, 000,000th time"
"Utterly inane farce about a princess who has the ability to keep things mighty cold and lead her kingdom into what is described as perpetual winter. This almost leads to tragedy for her sister and causes the former to go into a self-imposed exile while her kingdom freezes over.Funny that this tale of woe ends with the queen never getting a guy while the sister had two opportunities. Treachery abounds and it's shocking to see who is involved in this evil. Of course, there are parents, the king and queen who are lost at sea to bring further misery and mayhem to the situation.The singing voices,especially by Idina Menzel are wonderful and the songs are catchy."
"When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one."
"In the future, the world has been taken over by SkyNet, a computer AI that achieves sentient and launches a global nuclear holocaust, in a bid to wipe out humanity. One man John Conner leads the human resistance. They are on the verge of destroying SkyNet when it sends a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to the present day to kill John Conner's mother. Connor sends soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) from the killer machine.This is director James Cameron's first at bat, and he hits it out of the park. It is near perfection that started a franchise. First the story is perfectly constructed. All those hours of writing and rewriting during his deliveries really helped. Second the choice of Schwarzenegger is inspired. He is the perfect terminator. Third the intensity doesn't relent. It is a sci-fi horror that doesn't let go. It has the production of a much bigger action movie. It is a signpost for a genre, for a cultural touchstone, and for an era. It transcends being simply a movie."

"'In the year 2029, the robots have taken over but are losing the war... and they have devised a plan: send a robot back to the past to destroy the mother of the human leader, thus causing him never to be born. Unfortunately for the evil robots, human Kyle Reese has been sent back, too.While I think the sequel is flatly better, and I do not feel this film deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, it is a good film by all accounts. Action, good plot, decent acting... horror icons Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Dick Miller are all here. A young Bill Paxton even shows up.James Cameron has had an amazing career, and this was an early triumph. Even if he walked away from the franchise after the first film (a great science fiction tale), he would have kicked off an amazing series and a television show. With consistently strong writing, plot and continuity, we have to thank Cameron.'"
"'Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, I\'m going to shoot you if you don\'t slow down. They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down. The drama teacher tells his students, I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson\'s horse...The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing\'s chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a track star while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity'"
"21 JUMP STREET (2012) *** Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle,Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, Nick Offerman, Caroline Aaron, Joe Chrest. (Cameos: Holly Robinson Peete, Peter DeLuise, Johnny Depp) . Big-screen adaptation of the cult classic '80s TV series gets the comic overload reboot with Hill & Tatum as former high school nemeses who find themselves in the police and faced with undercover duty back to school to infiltrate a new drug pusher whose wares are causing some alarm. Better-than-anticipated yet still stupidly funny the film is far more entertaining than it should be thanks largely to the comic duo's chemistry and shrewdly incorporating the stars of the series in fun cameos. Hill, who co-scripted with Michael Bacall, executive produced with Tatum as well and Phil Lord & Chris Miller's forays from animation clearly evidence for the live-action shenanigans suggesting a Looney Tunes short at times. Nice chase scene with non-exploding vehicles as a tongue-thru-cheek attitude prevailed throughout makes a loser into a winner."
"'Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are a couple of underperforming cops. Their Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) sends them back to high school to go undercover as students to crack a drug ring.This is an re-imagining of the 80s TV show. Unlike many others who try to remake 80s show, this one is actually funny, and joyous. They have great chemistry, and are hilarious together. Surprisingly, Channing Tatum does have some comedic chops. His timing is quite good. Jonah Hill is a great partner. Ice Cube does an intimidating Captain without losing likability. In fact, I think everybody is having a good fun time, and I think it shows.'"
"STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) *** Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Lupita Nyong'o, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Gwendoline Christie, Kelly Marie Tran, Laura Dern, Benicio Del Toro, (Voice of Frank Oz), Billie Lourd, Joonas Suotamo, Jimmy Vee, Justin Theroux, Warwick Davis, (Voice of Joseph Gorden-Levitt). The latest chapter in the phenomenal sci-fi fantasy adventure franchise takes up with the Rebellion alliance once again fighting the evil Empire for peace in the galaxy and having a reunion of sorts with brother and sister Luke & Leia (Hamill and Fisher, in her swan song, both the heart and soul of the film and both amazingly the best things about the film overall too). Director Rian Johnson brings out all the guns with amazing CGI fireworks (many battles and kick-ass light saber stand-offs) yet overall the screenplay he has cooked up fails with the new characters (which I will not mention since they all are rather lame and seriously Del Toro - your check is in the mail for sleepwalking thru this; shameful!) and some unusual shots of humor (taking pages out of Monty Python and Spaceballs) but continues the traditional theme of uniting via The Force to find your true inner spirit (Ridley and Driver excel as the new life force - yes, pun intended) and resolve."
"Batman takes on the crime lords with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. However an even bigger evil rises to terrorize Gotham.Maggie Gyllenhaal is an improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart adds a good performance as Harvey Dent. In the end, this is Heath Ledger's movie. He overpowers everybody. His early death may have immortalized him, but my opinion isn't inflated. His presence is electric. It helps that his character is so ridiculously crazy. His motivation has nothing to do with power or money which is so mundane. He wants chaos and that is so much more fascinating. Heath Ledger makes this movie great. And it surpasses the series reboot 'Batman Begins'."
"After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel."
"Brad Pitt stars in this apocalyptic spectacle concerning a world-wide zombie uprising. A patchwork of scenes of zombies amok and a determined everyday man trying to stop a horrific pandemic. Sounds like money and a winner. Most everything in the life of former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane(Pitt)and his family are falling in line with many hopes and dreams. But how long do you think that peace and happiness lasts now days? Somehow a disease has caused zombies to attack those still pumping blood. Mindless zombies are threatening to spread a mysterious infection to all corners of the earth. Lane is reluctantly pressed into action and takes on the mission of traveling the globe to investigate this horrible calamity threatening mankind. Lane bravely goes against all odds in search of answers before there is nothing left but zombies feeding off of each other. Expect to be totally immersed with this gargantuan production from beginning to end. If Pitt can't pull this off, who can? Well, come on...you know what I mean. WORLD WAR Z is rated PG-13 due to graphic and disturbing images of zombie violence. Rounding out the cast: Mireille Enos, James Badge Dale, David Morse, Peter Capaldi, Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove."
"'World War Z, directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt\'s character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.'"
"I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books."
"I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper."
"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful."
'Ethan and Joel Coen are at it again. Their masterful directing and writing makes this movie unforgettable. Snowy North Dakota sets the mood real well for this maliciously funny story of a botched kidnapping. William Macy is a car salesman in the need of some big bucks. He hires two inept scum buckets (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)to kidnap his wife thus letting him cash in on a huge ransom to be paid by his father-in-law. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police chief that takes charge of picking up the pieces of the crime that has come unraveled.Strong violence and foul language go hand in hand with the awkward and hilarious situations. You will certainly be eager to watch this one again immediately.'
"'Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law\'s money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a true story, which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens\' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****'"
"'If you don\'t know what mental illness is like, you might think this is a hilarious picture. It actually is in many respects, but if you haven\'t had any experience with people or family members dealing with mental health issues, you may not get the full impact of this film and what it means to remain in treatment and faithfully take prescribed medications. The writers either had that real life experience or did their research very faithfully, because the reactions of characters like Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) are ones I\'ve observed personally with members of my own family. It\'s not always easy, and one must remain on the defensive more often than is comfortable when someone you care for is tortured by erratic mood swings and delusional thinking. It was struck home forcefully when Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) tells Pat in one of their sessions that one incident can change a lifetime. I can vouch for that and am thankful every day when the meds are working and life approaches a semblance of normalcy. I thought this was a brilliant movie in the way it offers hope to those afflicted with mental health issues of their own, and a way to deal with them effectively given the proper support of friends and loved ones.'"
"'Terrific and believable escape via troubled twosome. Life wasn\'t promised to be easy for Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper), spending eight months in a mental institution following his painful divorce only to be court ordered to move back home with his parents. Pat Sr.(Robert De Niro)and Delores(Jacki Weaver)try to understand their bipolar son, who insists on trying to cope with life without his medication in pursuit of a healthy living regime with hopes of reuniting with his ex-wife. Pat is looking hard for the silver linings in his life, when he meets another troubled soul, Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a self-proclaimed slut and woman of mystery since the death of her husband. Things really get complicated when the upbeat Tiffany offers to help the pathetic Pat reconnect with his ex. In return the fetching Tiffany wants Pat to be her partner in a dance competition. Could this be a therapeutic aid in their individual therapy or a step toward a meaningful relationship between them. Lawrence is adorable, witty and hilarious. Cooper is as confusing as De Niro is deadpan funny. And the use of Stevie Wonder\'s My Cherie Amour is brilliant. Rounding out the cast: Chris Tucker, Julia Stiles, Anupam Kher, Shea Wingham and Paul Herman.'"
"I tried to get through this. Really I did. And I could appreciate the effort that went into the performances and the wads of dough that must have been spent on special effects. The atmosphere too is lucidly rendered -- night time in the big city.But my enjoyment was hampered by the fact that I'd outgrown most of this stuff about the time I entered High School, and that was when the comic-book Batman still looked like a human being, not a bemuscled behemoth.The experience, the viewing of this, as much of it as I could stand, was exhausting. You have never seen so many vehicles, large and small, racing through the gloomy and deserted urban streets. And every one of them seems to crash and turn into an exploding fireball emitting shards of glass and flaps of unidentifiable metal.The business is taken seriously too. The blows rained upon the victims seem to hurt. The occasional wisecracks from The Joker don't begin to make up for the realistic pain.It all makes me wonder if our peculiar civilization hasn't entered the decadent period that precedes its fall from dominance. At least in the comic books you had to READ the dialog bubbles. Here, no challenge at all. Just sit back and let the despondency overwhelm you.I know, I know. I missed the point. It's just a fantasy. Right enough, but it's somebody else's fantasy, not mine."
"The old song that every cloud must have a silver lining is so very much appropriate to this 2012 film.Bradley Cooper, as a bipolar man recently discharged from a mental institution, gives a stellar performance in trying to reconnect with his unfaithful wife, the latter driving him to his outrageous behavior and subsequent institutionalization. He meets up with Tiffany, played in a sparkling way by the perky Jennifer Lawrence. They are both tremendous in their emotional outbursts and find through their multitude of problems that they're the perfect couple.Robert De Niro had his best part in years as Cooper's book-making father who wants to use watching television football with his son as a means of therapy. As the mother, Jacki Weaver received a totally undeserved Oscar nomination in the supporting category. Note that the above 3 thespians were all nominated with Lawrence winning and they were all deserved for Oscar consideration.Anyone suggest that Cooper and Miss Lawrence dance in Dancing with the Stars?"
"When my movie theatre-working friend suggested seeing a film yesterday, this was the only one currently out that neither of us had seen yet that I wanted to watch. And both of us were very glad for the choice! I mean, you wouldn't think a romantic comedy-drama about two emotionally or mentally depressed people possibly falling in love would hold much appeal but it did for me and my friend. And, yes, I did like the performances of both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in their roles and they're also both pleasing to the eyes so there's that, too! And I also liked Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents so they also deserved their Oscar nominations as much as Cooper and Ms. Lawrence. Also so glad Ms. Lawrence got her Golden Globe and if she wins her Academy Award, I'll be even more happy! Really, despite all the messy emotions that are explored here or maybe because of all that, I really enjoyed and highly recommend Silver Linings Playbook!"
"But it's more than that! The story is great, the actors enjoy their roles. And so will you, if you watch the movie! The movie has many players, but still concentrates on one central one (George Clooney's) for your attention. But I was a little bit surprised that Don Cheadle is not listed in the credits (according to IMDb) ...It's style and funny dialogues from beginning to the end. Andy Garcia is a great villain here too. Someone you like to see fall down. But the question is, does he? You'll have to see the movie for that. Be excited, be very excited! Especially if you know the Original (with Frank Sinatra and others), because this movie is an example, that a remake can in fact not only be as good as the Original, but be even better! Watch it and you'll see! :o)"
"Sharp, canny, dashing remake of the Frank Sinatra Rat Packer from 1960 about the ultimate Las Vegas heist. Master thief George Clooney and pal Brad Pitt enlist a disparate group of con-artists to rob billionaire casino owner Andy Garcia of his millions in his highly-guarded vault--and, just for good measure, his girl too. Wonderfully fast and hip, with a sleek direction by Steven Soderbergh (who never stops teasing the audience) and a glittering array of stars and character actors, all of whom get a good slice of the pie. Of course, the byzantine (and expensive) plot these guys concoct could never be duplicated in reality--and that outlandishness does spoil some of the fun. Still, the cartoony way this motley crew takes over the Bellagio, with Soderbergh's camera zipping around the action like a fox, provides high entertainment the whole way through. *** from ****"
"I'm aware that it is a remake of an earlier film but as I've not seen that I can't say if it is as good or not. This is a fun caper film with a star cast who all appear to be having a great time, that isn't to say that they don't do a good job however.The film opens with Danny Ocean, played by George Clooney, being released from prison. He has no plans of going straight though, he has a job planned, a big job that will require a large team of expert criminals. The job in question is robbing a Las Vegas casino, something considered impossible by most people but he thinks he has found away.The early part of the film concentrates on recruiting the team and their preparations for the job itself, when they start their on site preparations it becomes clear that money isn't Danny's only motivation for robbing this particular casino; its owner is going out with his ex-wife. The robbery itself is pretty exciting even though the viewer is never in much doubt that nothing bad will happen to our anti-heroes, after all it is a fun film not a gritty drama.I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to watch a fun will that doesn't contain lots of violence, it might not be all that realistic but if you can suspend your disbelief it is a well made, well acted caper film."
"'Ocean\'s 11 was the first in what became an unwanted trilogy, but I think most people forget the others and just watch this one.And it\'s not actually that bad a film. It relies very, very heavily on the chemistry between the main leads (Clooney, Pitt, Damon, Roberts) but there is a decent story being told too.There\'s lots of witty banter and one-upmanship that is entertaining and the heist itself is well directed.It can at some points come across as being a little overly smug though, in a sort of how can you not like this film? way. I found it a little self-indulgent as well.Overall, the best in the trilogy that shouldn\'t have been a trilogy at all.'"
"'The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.'"
"'I really loved Ratatouille, it was original, sweet and lots of fun. While not as laugh-out-loud funny as the two Toy Story films, it is definitely one of the better Pixars, and a complete delight from start to finish. Honestly, the whole family will find it just as delightful as I did, and the film has a great message a great cook can come from anywhere, summed up perfectly by Anton Ego. The story was highly original, if a little slow at the beginning, and deliciously engaging up to the last minute, and the animation was just spellbinding. The script, while not as irreverent as Toy Story, was very entertaining and touching, and I loved the characters- everyone was likable and unique, but what made Remy stand out for me was because he was so adorable, and his voice actor did a delightful job voicing him. The voice cast were very talented, and all did a superb job, especially Peter O\'Toole in a marvellous turn as the nasty food critic Anton Ego. All in all, a brilliant film, that fully succeeded in what it promised to do, to make us want to cook. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.'"
"I agree this Blu-Ray transfer is stunning, magnificent to view in many spots with very, very rich colors. Yet, I couldn't get into this story and was turned off my several of the main characters. I gave it two shots: on regular DVD and Blu-Ray and both times I never finished the film. I just interest. Only the mouse was likable enough for me. The humans were all too annoying to enjoy the film.These other characters were either too loud, obnoxious, nasty or irritating including the kid whom the rat helped! In other words - except for the mouse - both the good and bad guys were unlikable.All they these characters did was give me a headache with all their yelling and screaming. You have to love the silent mouse, though."
"'(Spoilers Ahead)Though Schindler\'s List is the best film on the horror that was the holocaust, Life Is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella in Italian) is way up there. And I enjoyed it.  Especially because the film doesn\'t completely circle around the concentration camp, just half of it.  Half of the film surrounds Guido Orefice (Roberto Benigni won a well deserved best actor Oscar as Guido, along with a second Oscar for best Foreign film as director and writer) as a Italian-Jewish waiter who is in love with a princess.  This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp.  But so to shield his son from the horrors, he makes a game the two can play as their ordeal unfolds.  Very original, and very well done, with Benigni acting now aa a Italian version of Charlie Chaplin. Excellent all around.  A+'"
"'Unbelievably enough, then it is only now in 2013 that I got around to actually watching The Dark Knight. Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with The Dark Knight, then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in The Dark Knight is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then The Dark Knight really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, The Dark Knight offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.The Dark Knight was a major step upwards from Batman Begins, and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch The Dark Knight Rises as well.'"

This half has more of the comedy than drama, but the second half is melodramatic as Guido has a son now with his princess and they are taken to a concentration camp.  But so to shield his son from the horrors, he makes a game the two can play as their ordeal unfolds.  Very original, and very well done, with Benigni acting now aa a Italian version of Charlie Chaplin. Excellent all around.  A+'"
It's 1939 Italy. Jewish Guido (Roberto Benigni) tries to open a bookstore but he continues to face hurdles with a smile. He falls for the lovely Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). She is engaged to an ambitious government official but she runs off with Guido. They get married and have a son named Joshua. The fascists would catch up to them but Guido would pretend the camp to be a giant game so that he can hide the truth from his son.Roberto Benigni is going for extremely broad comedy here which turns eventually. The movie is always a bit odd to have slapstick comedy while the audience knows perfectly well what is happening. It makes the movie unfunny. The movie is much more compelling as a heartfelt drama.
"Monsters generate energy by scaring kids. That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet."
"Goodish children's movie.In the city of Monstropolis, a company, Monsters Inc, harnesses the power of children's screams to generate electricity. Its employees, being monsters, venture into children's bedrooms and scare them. Then one day, a child accidentally returns with a monster to Monstropolis, something which should never happen...Quite original story. Starts off in good fashion and is pretty good fun. However, after a point is really just one huge chase / caper movie and gets fairly predictable as a result. This is where adults will generally zone out (it was certainly where I started to lose interest) but kids should still enjoy it.Good voice casting, with John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn and Jennifer Tilly in the main roles."
"'Monsters Inc came out on DVD this week, and now I have my own copy!! It is not very useful to try to evaluate this one against others since such an evaluation is so subjective. But I put it in the same superb category that such animated films as Toy Story, A Bug\'s Life, Shrek, and Disney\'s Tarzan are in. First, the quality of the animation and the picture quality. Unbelievably good. I can categorically say it is the best picture quality I have seen on DVD, and the movement and facial expressions of the animated characters makes it almost feel like they are real. Second, the story. How inventive! The only thing separating the monster world from the real world are the doors. The company, Monsters Inc, must have millions of them in inventory, computerized for quick call-up to send in a monster to get screams and charge up their energy cells.The main characters are voiced by John Goodman (big, blue, hairy kitty with purple spots) and Billy Crystal (short, green, one-eyed monster) and their acting add so much. Plus the great music provided by Randy Newman. Overall an hour and a half of pure edge of your seat entertainment. And that doesn\'t even include the 3+ hours of extras on the second disk. You can select either standard or widescreen format, and I watched mine widescreen on a 16:9 HDTV with 5-channel surround system with powered subwoofer. Almost like being in a theater!!'"
"For me District 9 is neither a masterpiece or a bad movie, instead it is an interesting but not entirely successful kind of movie.For a low budget movie, District 9 does look excellent. The cinematography, editing and effects are very, very good, and I did accept the aliens appearance wise. The soundtrack and sound also create a sense of foreboding and genuine atmosphere, the concept is amazing and the film does start off brilliantly. The acting overall by a largely unknown cast is good, as is the direction, and the lead characters are likable.What didn't impress me so much, is that while District 9 does have heart, that I could see from how it was made and the enthusiasm of the actors and director, I wasn't entirely involved. As I've said, the film starts off with no problem, but the final third with plot points that were either rushed and underdeveloped or silly or clichÃ©d wasn't so good. The story doesn't quite live up to the concept for me, it was intriguing and thoughtfully handled but thin, the support characters aren't as well-thought out or as likable as the leads, the dialogue has some sketchiness that is particularly evident in the slower parts and final third and the pace does get sluggish sometimes.Overall, I did like it and was intrigued by it, but sorry it isn't a movie I would see again in a hurry. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"I'm cross with this film. It has the makings of a really good teen comedy. But there are two things which completely spoil it.One is the incessant foul language. It is completely unnecessary, adds nothing, and after a while it got on my nerves. The sex references are part of the story and didn't bother me at all, but the F word is simply used as a meaningless punctuation sound interjected into nearly every sentence uttered by nearly every character.The other was the character of Seth. I liked every character in the film - even the two idiot cops - except for odious, mouthy, obnoxious, self-centred, offensive, single-mindedly stupid Seth.I'm not sure how much of this movie was scripted and how much was improvised, but the character of Seth drops this film by two grades and the bad language by a further one. So if you don't mind non-stop pointless bad language, and you're happy for your central character to annoy you from the very first frame to the last, then I would grade this a 9 for you!"
"After about a month of playing theatres, I finally got to see Superbad with my friend after seeing the other movies that had come out that we wanted to see. My friend liked it though he thought it had too much profanity. I didn't have a problem with the language but I did think the funny stuff came in little doses between several scenes that dragged. I liked the performances of Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Chris Mintz-Plasse as the high school seniors trying to get laid two weeks before graduation as well as the slacker cops played by Bill Hader and the movie's co-writer Seth Rogen. But their performances weren't enough to make this a hilariously funny movie like I usually expect from producer Judd Apatow who had no hand in writing this movie like he had in his previously very funny directorial outings, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. Still, despite its unevenness, Superbad does get points for making the main characters' growing pains seem real and for getting the potential girlfriends of Hill and Cera not seem like such sluts..."
"'Maybe back then you couldn\'t tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they\'d have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.Speaking of hilarious: That\'s something that can be said about this movie. Of course many will start comparing this with American Pie, Porkys and what not. But the movie stands on its own two feet and has been copied a lot itself. Never to that success and never as good as Superbad obviously. If you like your teen comedies to be raunchy and dirty, this is exactly your cup of tea. After watching this, you might also be McLovin (this) ... no relation to any Fast Food chain by the way ...'"
"Superbad (2007): Dir: Greg Mottola / Cast: Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse; Emma Stone, Seth Rogen: Surprisingly hilarious teen comedy that despite its preference for toilet humour, it is done with wit and intelligence. It transcends those thoughts and actions of our youthful desires. Greg Mottola's film stars foul mouth Jonah Hill and timid Michael Cera who risk much to achieve booze for a party in hopes of bedding a couple of girls. Setup stems perhaps from experience but structure is basically one failed booze steal after another until it reaches a surprisingly acceptable conclusion. Hill is terrific in his foul mouth demeanor as he sets his sights on one goal and risks much to achieve it. Cera is more reserved yet also discovers young love. Christopher Mintz-Plasse pretty much dominates the film as nerdy Fogell whose fake ID contains the name McLovin. Bill Hader and Seth Rogen steal scenes as two inexperienced cops out to relive their youth, and see the opportunity through McLovin. Emma Stone plays the standard yet well played inspiration of Hill. Martha McIsaac plays her best friend whom Cera is smitten with and who Hill dislikes. Director Mottola avoid sentimentalism and creates a film that plays both for theme and hilarity. Trash humour and a theme regarding that mischievous youth in us but also long term friendships that are there when things go from bad to super bad. Score: 9 / 10"
"'I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book The Hunger Games or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!'"
"'In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 WarGames voice and proclaims, Shall we play a game? Of course Captain America can\'t catch the humor.Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.'"
"'In a future world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.When this film came out, it was huge. Probably Gilliam\'s biggest success to that time, and possibly still his biggest success today (2014), though he continues to make great films. And looking back on it, approximately twenty years later, it is as good as ever. They took La Jetee and fleshed out an entire world.Beyond the great concept, excellent sets and impressive cast (Brad Pitt in a break-out role) is a story that is so cleverly layered. Is Cole a time traveler? Is he crazy? Is the Army of the 12 Monkeys real? Who are they? And can the future be changed?'"
"'Twelve monkeys\'s got all the elements to become Terry Gilliam\'s masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a sustained rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogs. Moreover, he had a good nose about the cast. Twelve monkeys is also the first movie where Bruce Willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies. Here, a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero (as it was the case in Die hard). No matter how he tries, he\'s a prisoner of the time. The movie contains a very thrilling end too. It\'s got a real dramatic power. But this terrific movie is also a reflection about man, the dangers he dreads (notably, the ones that could cause the end of the world and here, these are virus that can create illnesses). No matter how long it will take, twelve monkeys will be estimated at its true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.'"
I like the bit with the monkeys. I didn't count them so I can't confirm if there are 12 or not
"While my friend wanted to watch this movie because he's a big fan of Brad Pitt, I was simply more interested in the premise and the fact it was shot in my neighboring city of New Orleans whose scenery is breathtaking here (the fact that present scenes are set during Hurricane Katrina was also a fine dramatic touch). Pitt is quite touching as a man aging backwards in time and I loved the romantic scenes with both Tilda Swinton as the middle-aged wife of a spy and Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend Daisy especially her dancing scenes. Those scenes on the tug boat with that tattoo captain were also good especially the wartime sequences. If there's one quibble, it's that I didn't see enough of Queenie's daughter to really discern how she got along with either her mother or her brother Ben. Otherwise, this was a fine piece of work from director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth who mined similar adapted territory when he previously worked on Forest Gump."
"It's the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Revolutionaries take over the American embassy and over 60 personnel are taken hostage. Six are able to escape to the residence of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). CIA expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) devises a crazy plan to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew.For a well known history and predestine ending, this is quite compelling, tense, and suspenseful. Affleck did take some liberties with the real story. About midway onwards, there are a few too many liberties taken to Hollywood it up. They even gin up a car chase. I understand drama has to be pump up. It's really a minor defect. The movie is filled with great acting, tense moments, and even has a few laughs. Of the Oscar nominees, I'd probably pick 'Django Unchained' and this solidly in second."
"'This Oscar winning film of 2012 is a true story dealing with the Iranian Hostage Crisis of 1979-80, the ultimate crisis that made Jimmy Carter a one term president.Angered by the acceptance of the cancer stricken Shah of Iran to America, the Iranians invaded our embassy there and took many people hostage. The story deals with the attempt of our CIA launching a covert action to free the 6 people in the embassy who had fled at the time of its take-over and were granted asylum in the Canadian Embassy.The plot involves a phony movie production of Argo, a phony film which would be used to get the six people out of the country.Alan Arkin and John Goodman really provided comic relief by working with our government to create this false attempt at movie making so as to fool the Iranians.As the 6 prepare to leave, tension builds in some very grueling scenes, as they appear to run into roadblocks in their attempt to flee the country.'"
"Somewhat-overrated suspense film with 'colorful' Hollywood overtures involves Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, real-life exfiltration specialist for the CIA whose bold plan in 1980 it was to get six Americans home from strife-ridden Iran, where they have been in-hiding since November 1979 when the U.S. Embassy was stormed by protesters over the CIA's involvement in Iranian politics. Mendez concocts a genuinely flamboyant plan--disguising the terrified group as Canadian filmmakers in the country to do pre-production work for a science-fiction film--but nothing about Affleck's leadweight performance suggests this kind of imaginative thinking. Affleck, who also co-produced and directed the film, does a good job at laying out the complicated scenario, however his button-pushing tactics at the final gate (leading to a nick-of-time climax) are a bit cheap. Audiences may feel the good will, and certainly the milieu is vividly captured. Alan Arkin, as a passed-his-prime movie producer, and John Goodman, as a Hollywood makeup artist, are both fine in support, though this section of the picture is undernourished. **1/2 from ****"
"A life-long fan of Basil Rathbone's classic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, I had my reservations about Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of the character, particularly with Guy Ritchie directing (let's not forget that the man was responsible for turning Vinnie Jones into a movie star!).As expected, this 21st century reinvention of Conan Doyle's great detective bears very little resemblance to any previous movie incarnation, Downey Jr. playing the sleuth as a scruffy, smug, loutish, and reckless brawler, while sidekick Watson (Jude Law) is considerably smarterâand handier with his fistsâthan Nigel Bruce ever was.Seeing the usually dapper detective and the equally eminent doctor portrayed in such manner is hard to come to terms with, but wasn't a deal-breaker for meâI can appreciate a new spin on an old themeâbut the asinine script and unnecessarily flashy direction sadly was. An illogical, plot-hole ridden piece of guff, the film is peppered with juvenile humour and heavily stylised action set-pieces in a desperate effort to try and detract from the many weaknesses and flaws in the narrative, which start with a highly implausible fake execution and become more and more strained as the movie progresses.As a piece of mindless popcorn nonsense, I guess this fares no worse than many a modern Hollywood blockbuster, but as a case for the finest crime-busting mind the world has ever known, it's far from brilliant."
"Guy Ritchie transforms Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stoic and methodical super sleuth into a scruffy, rough and tough detective; not exactly the great Basil Rathbone. Robert Downey Jr. earns his Golden Globe starring as London's legendary Sherlock Holmes. His trusted side-kick Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law. Rachel McAdams stars as the only woman to best Holmes and continues a very testy relationship with the detective. Holmes and Watson will face off against a mysterious villain named Blackstone(Mark Strong). Plenty of thrills mixed with violence and action comedy. Very interesting chemistry between Law and Downey Jr. Well photographed. Apt supporting cast featuring: Eddie Marsan, William Houston, Kelly Reilly, Hans Matheson and Robert Maillet."
"If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013"
"Books should not be compared to movies. Movie versions should not be compared to each other. If you are a true artist, you always put your stamp on your production. The stories of Arthur Conan Doyle are masterpieces and they have had their time. If one is willing to come up with a new angle using the characters as perceived by the public, more power to him. There have been hundreds of pastiches done with the Holmes canon. Anyway, the film before us uses a preposterous plot that has angered the purists. It's probably some of the same people who died a little each day after Lord of the Rings and Spiderman came out. This film is a joyful mess in the tradition of Indian Jones. The two principles, Holmes and Watson grow on us and take us on a merry ride through London into some pretty weird stuff. It doesn't matter what has been done before, just enjoy the ride and look to the future. But don't forget the wonderful efforts of Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. They can, indeed, coexist."
"Shaun (Simon Pegg) is trying to get out of his rut. He needs to pick up his game with girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). He needs to connect more with his mother (Penelope Wilton). His slacker friend Ed (Nick Frost) is annoying his other roommate. He's a meek appliance salesman. It's another bad day in his life, but things seem to be happening all around him. It's the zombie apocalypse and he doesn't notice at all. After Liz dumps him, he has an all night drinking session with Ed. In the morning, the clueless duo come face to face with the walking dead.It's a little slow at the start. It takes awhile to lay down the foundations. Once they start fighting the zombies, the movie is hilarious. Nick Frost is crazy funny. It's a great new irreverent take on the zombie movie."
"'This film is a comedic version of how an unlikely hero saved the day in a zombie outbreak.Shaun is a loser but he is stimulated to change for the right direction. Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one.'"
"'I\'ve read a lot about how Shaun of the Dead borrows a lot from a TV show called Spaced. I have to admit that I\'ve never heard of Spaced. But even so, this movie is still really great. More than just a zombie movie - or even just a spoof - it\'s sort of a look at how various factors in our lives make us zombie-like. Everything has a very English feel to it, and the zombies themselves are almost hypnotic. I\'d never heard of Simon Pegg before seeing SOTD, but I can certainly say that he does a hilarious job as the out-and-out Brit having to battle the living dead. Definitely worth seeing. Also starring Penelope Wilton (Kevin Kline\'s wife in Cry Freedom) and Bill Nighy.'"
"This 2nd (or fifth) enstallment in the Star Wars series I believe is the best one yet (and ever).  The special effects are as good if not better than the first film and the characters are much better than in the first.  Though George Lucas didn't direct this enstallment, I think that's good because it gives the chance for Irvin Kershner a chance to see what he can put on the screen for us to watch.  And it is actually quite good.  With a terrific soundtrack by John Williams, the character Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz who is my favorite puppetter ever beside Jim Henson) and a startling revelation (this is the film where we find out Darth Vader's secret), this film is a dark, enchanting and great movie experience."
"'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was made in 1989 and bristles with excitement, humor, suspense, special effects and, as a real plus, character development. In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy\'s father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ\'s blood while interring him. It\'s up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there\'s a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.'"
"I enjoyed this film. Eastwood is about as snarly as I've ever seen him. He has taken Archie Bunker to the next level. He terrorizes his neighbors, is hateful to his children, and incredibly intolerant of a changing world. With that said, this is a story about redemption. It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.lThe whole thing kind of slides off into predictability toward the end, but it's a good story and had to end some way, especially with Kowalski's self realizations and his rendezvous with death. The other thing is just watching a masterful actor take on this role and squeeze every last drop out of it."
"Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is an old Korean War hero who recently lost his loving wife. He's a hard cold man of a different generation. He's angry at young grandkids, his new Mon neighbors, and nosy Father Janovich (Christopher Carley). The next door neighbor boy is shy Thao who gets wrangled into trying to steal Walt's Gran Torino by his older gangster cousin.There are lots of easy stereotypes. Clint is playing the hard man. It might as well be the man with no name in the hood. Clint is acting with a bunch of nobodies. That's the biggest problem in this movie. The other actors are not up to snuff. The only one capable is the girl Ahney Her who can only really hold her own.In the end, we love this Clint character. That's all that matters. He is compelling, and we have all grown up with this character. We know him. The movie is the better for it."
"Why has this movie and its director/star been ignored by the Oscar committee? Clint Eastwood plays Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Walt is recently widowed, but obviously has been crusty and rough around the edges and bigoted and prejudiced for most of his life. Still living in the old neighborhood he is uncomfortable with the Hmong family that have become his new neighbors. He will soon reluctantly befriend the young girl Sue Lor(Ahney Her)and her brother Thao Vang(Bee Vang), who actually tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. When crusty Walt defends the brother and sister from a rivalry gang of the Hmong family, he becomes treated as the neighborhood's guardian angel. My favorite scenes are any and all with Sue Lor answering Walt's non-PC and bigoted comments matching him barb for barb. GRAN TORINO in spite of being pretty predictable, it is a heart-felt human drama finding comedy in indifference.Also in the cast: Brian Howe, Brian Haley, Brooke Chia Thao, Chee Thao and Scott Eastwood, you know who's son."
"Pixar makes a cartoon about depression and it is aimed at kids.Riley is a happy 11 year old girl whose parents have moved from Minnesota to San Francisco. Being apart from her friends and her hockey team has upset the balance of her her core memories and five emotions of Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling.) Joy is the main controlling factor in Riley's life.It is Sadness though that threatens to unbalance Riley and in the turmoil the two emotions of Joy and Sadness get moved to her Long Term Memory compartment. This leaves Fear, Disgust, and Anger in charge of her brain, the Headquarter and they do not know how to control Riley now she is in her new school in the big city. Riley gets moody withdrawn and sad. Her parents worry that their sweet little child has gone.Joy and Sadness need to find a way back to the Headquarter before permanent damage is done to Riley and they do this with the of a childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind.)This is a multi layered story shown in a colourful and frenetic way. Kids would enjoy that side of it. However Inside Out is also a bittersweet film. While I appreciated the cerebral subtext of the film, as a feature length cartoon the story did feel clunky at times."
"Keller and Grace Dover's worst fears come true, their six year old daughter Anna and her friend Joy go missing, suspicions point to Alex Jones, the driver of an RV which was parked near by. Detective Loki is in charge of the case, he has no choice but to release Alex, having only circumstantial evidence to hold him on. Desperate father Keller decides to take matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex, hiding him behind a false wall and battering him regularly into a confession.This is one of the darkest, most bleak films I can remember, almost slightly too bleak in terms of tone, a wee bit too harrowing in parts, that said it was exceptionally well acted, well directed, and definitely one of those films that stirs the emotions. I wish it wasn't so long, it seemed to go on forever.Far from being a feel good film, it's violence with linger with you long after the credits have rolled.Paul Dano was brilliant in his part, such a good actor, possibly the best element of the film, although Jackman puts in a stellar performance too. Gritty, heavy and full of suspense, definitely worth a watch. 8/10"
"I'm not an expert on the Bond canon, but I love Daniel Craig, especially after seeing him on stage in A Steady Rain, and I admire much of Sam Mendes' work.I found Skyfall to be fun and exciting. It cost a fortune and looked it.Nothing original about the plot - a stolen list of agents - this is the latest plot for many spy films. Also I agree with one of the reviews here that I read - the list just seems to get forgotten about.What I can't believe is that people pick these films apart as if they're supposed to be realistic. There is nothing realistic about them, so why ask why Naomi only had one bullet etc. In these types of films, you have to just go with them.Judi Dench as M, who is in danger here, is marvelous, and Javier Bardem is an absolute scary, crazy scream as Bond's nemesis. Daniel Craig is wonderfully handsome and in excellent shape. He's a brilliant actor and totally wasted in these films, but I suppose the money is fantastic.Ralph Fiennes lets his receding hairline show and drops his leading man status here, and he gives a steely performance.There are enough explosions, car chases, fights, shootings, and train wrecks to last a lifetime. But it's nonstop action and nonstop entertainment. Don't analyze this type of film too much. Just go along for the ride and hope someone doesn't blow up the car."

"'Very nice animation, it tells the story of a young girl who has grown up in Minnesota but is uprooted when her dad and mom have to move to San Francisco with his job. Young Riley has many good memories, her friends, her hockey team. But she hits a rough patch after they move.But the animated movie isn\'t so much about Riley and her folks as it is about the world of head office. It is an unseen world where each person, and even pets, have a tiny entity for each of their emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, etc. The story starts when Riley is first born, the team of unseen entities see through her eyes and give her emotions motivation. Her memories are represented by different color spheres stored in permanent memory in head office. The two main emotions we see are voiced by Amy Poehler as Riley\'s Joy and Phyllis Smith as Riley\'s Sadness. And we see that sometimes sadness is necessary to appreciate what is really important.I like it for the novelty, it makes one think.'"
This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters. This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today. No matter how many films Dreamworks milk the Shrek franchise for it will never have the heart or the humour of Toy Story.
"A kid's bedroom full of toys comes to life when humans aren't around; each toy, both new and retro-vintage, has his or her own individual personality, and they're all thrilled to meet the new member of the pack, birthday present Buzz Lightyear, who just may usurp Sheriff Woody in their pre-teen owner's heart. Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****"
"'Pixar became a household name in 1995 with Toy Story, about cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his rival, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who have to rely on each other\'s abilities and intuition to survive a snafu.I guess that this wasn\'t a masterpiece in the general sense of the word, but it\'s impressive nonetheless (who would have guessed that Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn would ever do voices in a cartoon?). And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head\'s lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser). But other than that, there\'s nothing objectionable here. Very interesting.'"
'I can see why this was a big hit at the time. Well made and with enough wit and references for the adults to enjoy it. Pixar brought in a whole new style of animation here and blew away the increasingly old-fashioned Disney hits.'
"'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as Woody and Allen as Buzz Armstrong, I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed winner as is the sequel.'"
"'I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn\'t allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The real plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy\'s donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit. Nothing ever enters his brain without immediately going to his mouth. This is a fun film, and even if it does go for bathroom humor, it done with great aplomb!'"
"This animated fantasy is far and beyond others in the genre. This is the standard others will be judged by for a long time to come. A peace loving ogre called Shrek(Mike Myers) is upset when his swamp is invaded with fairy tale characters. A lonely, hysterically funny donkey(Eddie Murphy)forces his way into becoming Shrek's running buddy. An egomaniacal lord(John Lithgow)has the chance to become king, if he marries. Shrek is offered his swamp vacated if he retrieves the pretty princess Fiona(Cameron Diaz)and brings her to the midget ruler for marriage.The crude 'potty' humor is mild and does not distract from the clever written story line; and this comedy can't help but amuse viewers of all ages. Myers of course has the top billing, but I think Murphy steals the whole show. I think the witty donkey could carry his own movie someday. SHREK lives up to and deserves all of its accolades. Take the time to experience a superb story of love and companionship."
"'For younger viewers, they might not understand the impact of Shrek on the film industry and CGI movies. However, being an older guy, I remember how groundbreaking and amazing the computer animation was when the film debuted. It was head and shoulders better than the few CGI movies that had come out in the previous decade...and it finally gave Pixar a serious run for the money. In addition, the plot was very adult...and the film\'s appeal was much greater than a typical CGI story. Great animation, great story telling and great voice acting, while the movie isn\'t quite impressive to see today, it still holds up very well and is well worth your time.I could easily say more but this film has over a thousand reviews....so I\'ll just end it here!'"
"What can I say? This film is amazing, and I would go further and say it is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, and one of my favourites of the 90s. The cinematography and scenery are spellbinding, and the soundtrack is brilliant, one of the best soundtracks in a Tarantino film actually. The plot is every bit as compelling as that for Reservoir Dogs, while the dialogue is endlessly quotable and quite hard-boiled. The direction is superb, as are the performances. As excellent as Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis and Christopher Walken are, the film's best actors are John Travolta and Samuel L.Jackson who are unforgettable. Pulp Fiction also has a wealth of characters and crossplots that is really quite astonishing. All in all, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"I liked the incidental music very much, especially in the escape from the Dragon scene. I wasn't hugely fond of the pop music featured, but putting that minor quibble aside, this was still an original and funny animated film, that will please any animation lover. The animation is faultless, never stiff, and lovely backgrounds. The script is laugh-out-loud funny with the fairytale characters, Gingerbread Man especially, and Robin Hood. The characters are definitely memorable, and the terrific voice cast brings the film to life. Mike Myers voices the ogre with feeling, but it is Eddie Murphy who steals the film. Though Cameron Diaz is lovely as Fiona, and John Lithgow is delightfully villainous as Lord Farquad, though his villain isn't the most memorable villain ever in an animation. The film sparkles with heart and humour, it is impossible not to like it. In conclusion, look out for it, you'll be glad you did! 9/10 Bethany Cox."
"'I\'d never heard of Audrey Tautou when Le fabuleux destin d\'Amelie Poulain (called Amelie in English) came out, but I gotta say that she is one great actress (not to mention really hot). This movie of course casts her as a young vivacious Parisian who sets up relationships between people, and then begins looking into her own potential love life.I swear that I can\'t find anything bad to say about this movie; it was done perfectly in every way. Jean-Pierre Jeunet would later cast Audrey Tautou and Dominique Pinon in the equally good - if gut-wrenchingly violent - Very Long Engagement. It all continues his well done streak started by Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children (he also directed Alien: Resurrection, but that\'s another story).All in all, you\'re sure to love every aspect of Amelie. I\'m eager to see how Audrey Tautou does playing Sophie in The Da Vinci Code.'"
"'I Loved this movie. The words, the colour, the girl'"
"The story of Amelie will either grab you or it won't. Certainly this is one of the greatest looking films, with a witty frantic style that is a pleasure to look at simply because there is so much to look at. Those wanting to study how to make a film from a visual stand point should put this on the list of films to study.The story is a mixed bag. I know many people who have watched this film and fell in love with its quirky romance and view of life. I on the other hand was pained from the get go, finding its attempts at humor severely lacking in everything even in the ability to even make me crack a smile. To me it wants to be applauded for being off center instead of being good.Try it, you may like it, or you maybe like me and wonder what all the shouting is about."
"'This film is about Tony Stark\'s fight against the US government and a man who wants revenge for what the Stark family did to his father forty years ago.I found Iron Man 2 very entertaining! It alternates between adrenaline and mischievous scenes. Scarlett Johansson is a great addition to the story, I was impressed by the way she pulled her character off. Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think Iron Man 2 is worth watching just for the ending alone. I think Iron Man 2 is great entertainment, and it\'s even better than Iron Man.'"
"With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure."
"'First, I should admit that I had never heard of Iron Man until the first movie got released. The first movie was certainly entertaining, as is this sequel (the third one was to a lesser extent). My only beef with this one is that Mickey Rourke\'s portrayal of the villain comes across as awkward; he\'s played lots of good roles, but he\'s the wrong person to cast as a Russian. I guess that we can ignore that and luxuriate in the title character\'s antics. I haven\'t seen The Avengers (or most of the other superhero movies from the past few years; there are so many that I can\'t tell which is which).Basically, we can recognize the movie as nice brain candy. I wonder how Stan Lee originally came with the idea for a superhero who wears an exoskeleton.'"

"What a family! And I'm not only talking about the Pixar family, but about the Incredibles family. An adventure for everyone. Pixar has another great movie up their sleeves. If they continue like that, the Top 100 List here on IMDb will solely exist/consist with their movies in there! Seriously though: The Incredibles takes the Superhero movie genre and takes it's own spin on it. I wouldn't say it spoofs the Superhero world, it just a funny movie, that happens to play in a world with Superheroes. Of course the voice talent on hand here does the story justice, as with the other Pixar movies. A fun-filled adventure that you shouldn't miss."
"'The Incredibles is fun, entertaining, visual splendid and it has some great action sequences.The power of this movie is in its great timing and solid main characters. The voice cast consists, unlike many other animated movies out of actors that are not \'hot\' at the moment. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are not exactly popular actors, that will draw lots of people to the theaters when you put their names on a poster. That\'s not why they were cast, they were just simply cast because they have great voices. I\'ve always liked Holly Hunter\'s voice and accent and it was great to finally hear her in an animated movie. The rest of the cast mainly consists out of people that made their debut with this movie (Except for Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee of course.). Kudos to that, I\'m sure they could had attached some big \'hot\' names to this project but they went for quality and the best instead of for the most popular.OK the story ain\'t exactly anything special but the main characters and fun feeling of the movie compensates for this. Also the action sequences know to impress. The action sequences feel like you\'re right in the middle of playing a computer game. The movie is entertaining and fun, what more could you ask for?Quite probably the most entertaining movie of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/'"
"'It seems escaping any definition. It is pure Tarantino. Or, more precise, one of the most Tarantino films. For the reasons who determs you see again , time by time. For stories and characters and dialogues and memorable scenes. For the music and for high performances. And for the unexpecting turns. And for the illusion to be an ordinary chain of stories. For emotions. And for the manner to tell them. And, sure, for the fascinating magic. And for too many others.'"
"Bob Parr is the secret identity of Mr. Incredible. His wife Helen is Elastigirl. They battle crime with Frozone in Metroville. Buddy Pine is a sycophant who wants desperately to be the sidekick Incrediboy. Mr. Incredible gets sued by various people he saved, and the government relocates all the superheroes into regular lives. Years later, Bob and Helen live in suburbia with their children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. Bob is aching for the good old days. He's starting to do the hero stuff again with his best friend Lucius Best aka Frozone. After another outburst by Bob at his job, the government is leaving the family on their own. Then Bob receives a message from Mirage offering a high paying super job. He decides to go without telling his wife.This is good nuclear family chemistry. That's the central strength of this movie. This is a family that loves each other despite their difficulties and the audience can see that love. It is fun and compelling with a few good jokes added in. There is the 50s vibe. There is the Bond-like volcano hideout. There are the great superhero inside jokes. This is a well written movie."
"'Previously, the only Taken with which I was familiar was the TV miniseries executive produced by Steven Spielberg (focusing on extraterrestrials). If I had heard the plot of this movie and knew nothing else about it, I would probably have assumed that it stars Harrison Ford. What a surprise that Liam Neeson plays a former government agent searching for his kidnapped daughter, using rather aggressive tactics. Seriously, some of what he does just might count as torture.What I thought early on was that the one girl did incredibly stupid things when they arrived in Paris: giving a bunch of information to a stranger. This is only the second time that I\'ve heard Albanian spoken (the first was in The Inside Man, in which I learned how to pronounce Enver Hoxha\'s surname). Anyway, this Taken isn\'t the movie that I would recommend above all others, but it\'s OK for the length that it runs. Also starring Famke Janssen.'"
"Outstanding and high octane action. Be ready for an elevated heart-rate and possible blood sugar spike. No matter what role Liam Neeson takes you can pretty well count on getting more than your buck's worth. Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a former super-spy with remarkable skills. His estranged teenage daughter Kim(Maggie Grace)and her friend Amanda(Katie Cassidy)are in Europe following the band U2 on tour. In Paris, the two girls are kidnapped for entry into the sex slave trade. Mills will rely on the full extent of his special skills to track down the abductors and conduct a one-man war with the purpose of rescuing his daughter and applying furious vengeance on the ruthless gang of kidnappers.Suspense is high. Violence is swift and without mercy. Adrenaline has your heart bouncing against your Adam's apple. TAKEN is highly recommended. Also in the cast: Famke Janssen, Radivoje Bukvic, Leland Orser, Arben Bajraktaraj and Holly Valance."
"'This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.Taken has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it\'s full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. Taken is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced.'"
"Sordid goods in a glossy package. Crime-drama from director Curtis Hanson concerning police corruption and murder in 1953 Los Angeles is, much like its scenario, seamy stuff underneath a classy veneer. Kevin Spacey is the narcotics officer, Russell Crowe the investigating officer, Guy Pierce the new lieutenant, Danny DeVito well-cast as the gossip columnist, and Kim Basinger the hooker whose bosses figure in the crime spree and drug-trafficking. Overstuffed, overwrought, with nasty sideline details detracting from the intense narrative of cops-gone-bad. The picture certainly looks good, and keeps its momentum up despite a byzantine plot that becomes harder and harder to follow. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar; the screenplay also copped statues for Hanson and Brian Helgeland, who based their script on James Ellroy's novel. The movie has punch--but doles it out in spurts. The first hour is best, and most of the ensemble acting is spot-on, but interest wanes once the story becomes too muddied up. **1/2 from ****"
"This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichÃ©d. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy."
"'The movie gives you some quick backgrounds on 4 of the characters, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and Raven / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The rest you have to guess at. And if you are like me, and have never read the comics, you are clueless and sit back and enjoy all the women in lingerie. It boils down to a good vs. evil scenario, which I can understand.The good guys create a machine that will locate other mutants. Charles is able to cleverly locate all the mutants during a single music montage. Meanwhile Kevin Bacon wants to start an all out nuclear war so the radiation will kill all the humans and only leave the mutants. This is remake of the history of the Cuban missile crisis.As always, great special effects. Background knowledge of the characters and other movies would be a plus, such as cameo by Hugh Jackman or Rebecca Romijn, but not necessary to enjoy the film.The nuclear reactor controls on the submarine were totally bogus for any era. Favorite line: I have been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again.F-bomb (thanks Hugh for the F.O.) sexual situations and Avatar nudity. Excellent prequel.'"
"A prequel designed to pave the way for the franchise retcon of Days of Future Past, X-Men: First Class charts how Professor X (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) meet and become friends, enlist fellow mutants to form a special team, battle against ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), and ultimately part company on bad terms after an accident leaves Xavier paralysed from the waist down.On a good day, I would have declared X-Men: First Class to be a hugely enjoyable superhero romp; unfortunately, I recently re-watched X-Men 2 and saw Days of Future Past earlier this week, both of which are so good that this one actually seems quite disappointing in comparison. McAvoy and Fassbender excel as the younger versions of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellern, the lovely Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen as Mystique, and the special effects are top notch, but the story seems less involved than the aforementioned X-Men films, while Matthew Vaughan's handling of the material is nowhere near as stylish or sophisticated as that of Bryan Singer.It's perhaps a bit harsh on a film that essentially serves its purpose, but having been spoilt by the excellence of Singer's entries in the franchise, I now expect much more from my X-Men.7/10, which is not bad, but still the lowest rating that I have given to any of the X-Men films I've seen so far (The Wolverine being the only one I have yet to watch)."
"'During the Cold War, Magneto joins Xavier in an effort to stop Sebastian Shaw. This movie has the same problems as the others in the franchise... too many characters(leading to not enough development, albeit what there is can be great) and superpowers(and in this, not all of them are even used all that interestingly... Angel didn\'t need to be in this), if there are good introductions to both. Added are the issues of trying to rush through events in a shortened timeframe and without an excessive running time. It does work out(this keeps to a nice pace), but it doesn\'t establish things(such as the brotherly relationship between Erik and Charles) as well as it could if it had spread the events out over several films. Still, it fares quite well. It\'s unlike the others in tone, closer to a Bond flick(and not only because of the period), that happens to have mutants for operatives. It\'s brutal at times, with Lensherr\'s quest for revenge. This isn\'t really action as much as thriller, and build-up and tension is the focus more than battles between people with abilities. The performances are strong, and the actors are well-cast. There are some memorable sequences in this, including the best flight I\'ve seen since the original Iron Man. The humor is hit and miss. There is partial nudity(Mystique) and brief strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the comic books and the other recent adaptations(except Origins: Wolverine and X-Men 3). 8/10'"
"'Well tonight is Oscar night as I write this, and this picture will likely garner it\'s share of awards. It deserves it\'s accolades, but I have to say, it\'s tough picture to watch at times. The whipping scenes in particular are extremely brutal, and just as in The Passion of the Christ, I have to wonder if any person\'s human body can stand up to that type of torture. It\'s too graphic even for words, and rending another person\'s flesh as depicted seems almost incomprehensible.Which is the point I guess. The brutality of slavery is on display here in all it\'s horror, and in today\'s politically charged climate, this makes for exceptional Oscar fodder. Too bad it were not otherwise. The film could probably win on it\'s own merits without the politics of the Academy involved, and if it does win Best Picture, who will know for sure? Of course this all a few hours before the fact, so in a little while I guess all the guessing games can begin.As well as the picture itself, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong\'o are solid contenders for their respective categories. The scene where Patsey begs Solomon to end her misery was a standout for me, and spoke to the unbearable circumstances so often associated with slavery and it\'s horrors. Again, a tough picture to watch, but probably an important one if it helps bridge the atrocities of a past century with healing instead of divisiveness.'"
"'Two just-graduated officers from Massachusetts Police Academy follow opposite sides of the law: William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to work undercover with the Irish mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) to get evidences to arrest him. His true identity is only known by his superiors Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). The protÃ©gÃ©e of Costello, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is promoted in the Boston Police Force and is the informer of Costello. Each police officer gives his best effort trying to disclose the identity of the other rat.The Departed is a good movie, with a great cast, but never deserved to be nominated to the Oscar. There are dozens of better movies, and even Donnie Brasco is better and better. The exaggerated and absurd story and situations have no credibility; some dialogs are simply ridiculous; shows prejudice against the Catholic Church with free aggression; the romance between William and the incompetent psychiatrist is senseless; and the character of Jack Nicholson is full of clichÃ©s and awful lines. A guy with such stupid attitudes could never be a powerful boss. Now I understand why Martin Scorsese asked to double check whether his name really was in the envelope of the Oscar. He probably knew that this movie could never be an Oscar winner, and he was afraid that it could be a joke. Actually it was another shameful joke of Hollywood. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Os Infiltrados (The Infiltrated)'"
"'We all know that in sequels, they take everything one step further, and you\'d better believe that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\'s Chest does that! With Johnny Depp continuing his Keith Richards-style buccaneer Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom resurrecting Will Turner, and Keira Knightley resurrecting Elizabeth Swann, how can you go wrong (especially since this sequel is grittier than the original)? Obviously, there\'s plenty of swashbuckling and CGI, but it\'s Depp\'s characterizations that carry the movie. Whether it\'s battles with Davy Jones and his crew, or an unpleasant encounter with the Kraken, this movie has something for everyone. Really cool.Also starring Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and Stellan Skarsgard. Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!'"
"'This movie wasn\'t made to satisfy the critics. It was made for the fans of the first Pirates movie (and of course for the Captain Jack Sparrow aficionado in most of us!).

"'I thought that Kick Ass was going to be more of a comedy that would leave you laughing your ass off.The story is pretty good, and have lots of interesting characters in it. Both main characters and supporting ones have been given good detail in being fleshed out on the screen.Now what surprised me the most was seeing Nicholas Cage in that role. I am not much of a fan of him, truth be told, but this time he was actually cool to look at. Especially the scene where he is toughening up the girl for a gunshot experience. I was laughing so hard at that scene.As for the effects and stuff, well they were nice. Lots of cool things going on in the movie.Another great \'superhero\' movie without super powers. Although Kick Ass is cool, it just doesn\'t reach Defendor to the knees. But I don\'t think Kick Ass will leave you disappointed though.Lots of nice action and a good, steady flow to the story, so you are never left bored. And the scenes with Hit Girl in action, wow! That was amazing, a young girl like that doing those kinds of scenes, that was awesome. Actually, I was surprised at the amount of action and blood in the movie.Kick Ass have something for everyone, so you should check out this movie. If you like this one, you might want to turn your attention to Defendor as well.'"
"KICK ASS is one of those rare films that do what they say on the tin: it absolutely kicks ass. I wasn't sure whether I'd appreciate the zany humour on offer here, as most of the time I find Hollywood comedy tired and laborious. This turns out to be a real shot in the arm, a film that takes great delight in spoofing such silly fare as the umpteenth Spiderman sequel/reboot and the interminable Iron Man movies. Kudos to Jane Goldman for writing it and Matthew Vaughn (whose LAYER CAKE I hated) for directing.The jokes come thick and fast, most of them funny. Aaron Johnson is a delightful as the ineffectual superhero, but the real star is Chloe Moretz, whose Hit Girl is probably the most original character in a film all year. What a surprise, too, to find Nicolas Cage so hilarious, with his deadpanned impression of Adam West's BATMAN another highlight. The plot moves along at a fair old whack and is loaded with delicious action and outrageous profanity. The CCTV footage showing Big Daddy tackling a warehouse full of thugs was wonderful. Mark Strong makes for another charismatic bad guy, but I'd like to start seeing him playing the hero once in a while. Vaughn can't help including roles for his old buddies like Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher, but there's no harm in that either. What a breath of fresh air this movie is."
"So this is what won the Oscar for Best Picture. The days of something like Titanic winning the award seems long gone now. Then again, most of what's popular are usually some special effects-epic that doesn't say anything particularly important, just meant to entertain for a couple hours. And that includes many superhero pictures that are permeating the industry right now. Michael Keaton plays an actor who once was part of that crowd when he was Birdman. Now he's trying to be legitimate again by starring and directing himself in a play based on a Raymond Carver story. Shot in what seems like one continuous take, this film is a compelling take on art vs. commerce, realism vs. simple playacting, and sanity vs. insanity. Keaton, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Emma Stone, and others do fine performances on how some actors cope with whatever insecurities they have when things don't always happen like they think they should. All I'll now say is Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is well worth seeing if you want your brain picked on for a couple of hours."
"'a great work. without any explanation. because all is simple - the style, the theme, the tension, the force of story, the pressure of image are present. the old Scorsese is at duty. and this does The Departed an event. because all seems be perfect. first - the cast. then - the hunt and its risks. the ambiguity, the impressive details, the feeling to see a film who escapes from every genre for becoming a simple story about duty, risks, lies and the build of truth. a powerful film who seduce for the architecture of each scene. in essence, the meet with the art of an unique director. and one of the most surprising/ambiguous ends. this is it The Departed.'"
"Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is famous for his role as comic book superhero Birdman. He is trying to revive his waning career with his first Broadway show that he wrote and directing with his friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis). His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) works as his grumpy assistant. Lesley (Naomi Watts) acts in the play. When a light falls on the lead, Lesley suggests headliner Mike Shiner (Edward Norton). Mike is a method actor who gets on Riggan's nerves.The concept of long continuous scenes is interesting. It adds to the level of difficulty. It is audacious and makes the audience sit up to pay attention. Although this movie does not take place in real time. It's not 2 hours of Riggan's life. There is one amazing scene with Keaton in his underwear. There is a daring in that it is outside in the real world. It adds a higher level of energy and that scene buzzes. The standout performance is Norton. He's got the most fun character. Everybody does a great job especially Galifianakis, Stone and of course Keaton."
"Despite the phenomenal acting of Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, this film brings a new definition to the word quirky. It deals with a has-been movie actor attempting a comeback via a Broadway production.It seems that the cast is normal when they act out the play on stage and then revert to all sorts of bizarre behavior, neurotic behavior and other nonsense in the dressing rooms of the theater they are performing at.It goes to show the frustration of acting and alter egos taking over. It is also shows the power of critics, in this case, the woman critic who though she hasn't seen the play, plans to demolish it with a scathing review, as she feels that Keaton and his brew lack artistic talent.The ending is sad, but in life, such things can very well happen, especially when we are dealing with neurotic characters. Amazing to me that the motion picture academy chose to reward this neurotic mess with a best picture Oscar."
"'This film is about an elderly man going on an unusual expedition to South America to fulfill his childhood promise to his late wife.I have heard numerous praise that Up is very good as it touches people so much that makes everyone cry. Hence, I had very high expectations of Up. I was not disappointed.Up is unusual as the touching part is actually in the first fifteen minutes of the film. In a short space of time, it spans through Carl\'s life with images without words. All the unsaid makes Carl\'s life summary ever more powerful. What price would people pay to have a love and dedication like this? The subsequent movie is more oriented to children. It is delightful, uplifting and vibrant. The quality of the animation is amazing, and there are times when I felt so sure that they film a real object and incorporate it into the animation. I enjoyed watching Up. Let it lift you up!'"
"'Pixar\'s Up is a colorful animation adventure film about the journey of a 78-year-old man to make a long-cherished dream come true. Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of It\'s a Wonderful Life - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen\'s, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.I don\'t generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty. It has a lot to say about love, the generations helping one another, and following your dreams. A real winner.'"
"A sure instant classic from Pixar. From the minds of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson comes a timely and endearing story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy widower, who is a hold out in the middle of major construction. He is not about to sell the home he shared with his devoted wife for decades. Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America. The trip is barely under way when the old geezer discovers he has a stowaway...8 year old Russell(Jordan Nagai), a chubby wilderness explorer trying to earn his final patch. Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog."
"'I watched this soon after it was released on video and was blown away ( Geddit ? ) by it . Unfortunately after seeing it a few more times since then I notice it`s become a victim of its own success . By that I mean every single British film released between 1999 and 2002 seemed to be about gangsters in one form or another carrying out a scam against a funky soundtrack in an inferior retread of LSATSB . In fact Guy Ritchie isn`t below plagerising himself with SNATCH which was basically the same film stylewise . But this was the original and best of the Brit gangster new wave. Brilliantly written in a sharp bleakly comical style with some mind bending cinematography by Tim Maurice Jones . There is some criticism that the acting is a bit wooden but I guess that`s deliberate on the part of Ritchie so that the dialogue comes to the fore . And what great lines the characters have , especially Rory`s  Do you understand Nicholas ? Good cos if you don`t I`ll kill ya  speech .BTW this film cost less than one million pounds to make . Take note Hollywood that you don`t have to spend tens of millions of dollars to make a great movie'"
"'The DVD version is very well done, sharp video transfer and good soundtrack, but you need a system with a subwoofer to get the full benefit from mood music.This is *not* a movie for those looking for a nice story and a message.  The characters are all crooks.  They beat and shoot each other. They plot to steal each others\' money and guns. They use drugs.  They have no morals. My wife walked out half-way, but she doesn\'t usually like British movies. \nHowever, if you can get past all that, there is lots of funny stuff in this movie.  You find out from the extra DVD information that some of the crooks really are crooks with some acting experience, and it comes across that way.Imagine Trainspotting  meets Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and you\'ll have the gist of this flick.  I give it a 6 of 10.  But then, I thought The Waterboy was about the funniest movie ever!'"
"'Its still a monotone teenflick. it sometimes tries a little bit too hard to be progressive and woke, but it keeps it in a nice balance overall. but in the end its progressiveness is its only thing that stands out.6/10: not much special'"
'3 episodes till now and i can say I pretty much enjoyed it!\nI like the relationship between otis and meave.\nI like how the series talks openly about the sex between teens because alot of people are shy and cant talk about it but i can recommend this series as a teaching -comedy+drama- series.'
"For awhile The Walking Dead was one of my favorite shows until season 7 and 8 as of recently I got back to it and forgot how enjoyable it is a lot of the time. The series has some of the most exciting, emotional, and devastating bits that are kinda necessary more than most shows ever! The cast is excellent, writing has ups/ downs, even a fair amount of comedy, so much of it all I love! It's weird the way the direction plays out throughout the coarse of the series kinda like Supernatural was for me I'll be happy when it's over. I'm sorry about my review the show has gone down hill and wanted to be honest about it."
"Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish."
"The Walking Dead, up until after the Season 7 premiere, was a show that I looked forward to every week. It was a really well done drama with great performances from the whole cast, walkers included. This did not just apply to a handful of the main cast because some great characters came and went. Every time we lost a good character, we most often were introduced to a just as good if not better character. Not only that, but it was faithful to the themes of the comic books. The only downside was the quality of the CGI effects, but that's understandable seeing as how it is a cable show and probably does not have the same budget as say Game of Thrones. However, this doesn't detract too much from the show. After the season 7 premiere, the show began to falter. The story arcs seemed way to stretched out of the point where a good half of the episodes were filler and it seemed like it lost its worrysome sense that anyone could go at anytime. However, Season 9 brought the show back to its roots in a sense. That danger became a reality once again and the episodes no longer felt like filler. If they keep up with this, the show could regain its footing it once had a few seasons prior."
"'Brilliant show for the first 2 seasons. I can recall a time when I couldn\'t wait for Sunday nights to see the further exploits of my favorite fictional made man Tony Soprano and his interaction with his family and his job trying to balance the two. The writing was superb, the characters were all exquisite and the episodes were among the best on TV. Then quite a bit of the magic of the show died when Big D got whacked. It was never the same, I kept watching and hoping though. Season 3 was just alright nothing compared to the first 2 amazing seasons. Season 4 I choose to stop watching about three quarters of the way through. It was awful soap opera BS. They turned one of my favorite shows sour. Gold had been turned into manure. But by than I had the immaculate the Shield to cushion the fall. I went away and never looked back. Season 5 may have been good for all I know. I don\'t care either. The Sopranos is dead to me, they just haven\'t had the decency to bury the body in the Medowlands yet.My grade for Seasons 1 & 2: A+ Season 3: C+ Season 4: D'"
"'it is a great show. not only for acting or script but for the high respect for measure. the humor, the cruelty, the sarcasm, the family life and the justice are pieces of precise puzzle. and that is the secret for its science to be not only realistic, not successful or seductive but itself. the courage to present a delicate subject in right manner is the best thing. and the detail who transforms it in a series -mirror for society sins. film about vulnerabilities of strong men, it has the rare science to use the actors gifts in subtle manner. and that is the source of a touching, impressive story about the life and death.'"
"'I can\'t believe that it took me this long to get around to seeing The Sopranos. I had heard a lot about it, but I can affirm that with this show, Six Feet Under and Game of Thrones, HBO revolutionized TV in the 21st century. A gritty look at a mob boss and how he tries to balance his work life and family, this show pulls no punches. One of the points that it makes is that there aren\'t really any good or bad characters. People do what they think best serves the family.I don\'t know if I would go so far as to call it the greatest show ever - my personal fave of HBO\'s series is Six Feet Under - but the writing, acting and direction combine to make something that you won\'t get on the networks or basic cable. If you want to understand some of the best that TV can provide, then you owe it to yourself to watch The Sopranos. Great show.Too bad that James Gandolfini, Nancy Marchand and the recently deceased Frank Vincent are no longer with us.'"

'First season was amazing. next two were good. then i started rating shows:Season 4: 1/10\ni had to force myself to finish this season. it was horrendous (1 viewing)Season 5: 1/10\ni quit a few episodes in. i quit the show'
"If this season six is a parody on the genre of clichÃ©d/trite hauntings from wronged past inhabitants who once lived in a rundown New England (or thereabouts) mansion followed by unexplained disappearances & murders with ghostly images, closing doors, things falling/flying and oftentimes filmed using the shaky camera redux technique then I give it three stars. Because, it had all that. Furthermore, it also had the overused shaky camera horror interviews of those who survived (or maybe didn't, but a filmed archive did), and even a shaky camera film crew meeting their demises from the ephemeral inhabitants. Otherwise, too much time spent on talking heads and everything else predictable."
"I've had a bad illness for a few months. That's why I couldn't go to the office.. I was doing my job at home. At the same time, I was very depressed. Yesterday I learned that I will get better. This is very good news. I watched this series in the last 6 months (when I was sick) and it made me very happy. It was funny and entertaining. I liked it very much. Thanks !"
"'Seinfeld has inserted relevant phrases, words, characters, situations into pop culture and American way of living. No kidding. This sitcom is a highlight in 90\'s culture.I\'m not exaggerating when saying that the situations in Seinfeld are seriously taken from real life but only in a funnier way. There\'s humor for all tastes: we get black humor, plenty of sarcasm, laughing at yourself (come on, you can be identified with ANY of the 4 lead characters), double sense, sexual humor, scatological jokes, and more.I enjoyed every single character. The guest appearances added that extra something that sitcoms need. But you never get tired of Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, or George. All of them have elements from any person with a regular life. Heck, when something in the likes of Murphy\'s Law happens to me in real life, then I immediately think about Seinfeld.What I\'m trying to say is that this is a very important t.v. show. It set the rules for situation comedies, sarcasm, and more. I have thanked this series for making my life better, happier. I always laugh out loud no matter what episode is. This is definitely the best and funnier sitcom ever. No doubt about it. Forget about the 80\'s corny humor and moral messages; the 90\'s unique humor will survive the course of time. If nothing means hilarious, then I\'m demented because I laugh everyday with this!'"
"'I love this show.I can\'t believe that this receiving criticism from users that hail worthless trash as Friends  . The story follows the life of the comedian Jerry Seinfeld from a fictional point of view ,and his relationship with his friends ,George (Jason Alexander ),Elaine (Julia Louis Dreyfus ) and Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards ).The group keep talking about relationships ,love,movies ...and also causing a lot of problems around them .This was a great show that was always faithful to his style and I don\'t agree that the last episodes were bad .Many shows try to imitate the brilliant humor of this show ,and all fail.Seinfled  is unique .'"
"I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"'a sitcom about nothing. it is the first definition. and it seems be the best. because it is only a series of scenes, situations, dark/bitter/absurd humor. and nothing more. a stand up comedian, his family and friends and neighbors, his girlfriends, his crisis, his falls. all in a strange game. but Seinfeld has a small virtue - it is a honest story about life. ordinary life. the life of every day. the life around bizarre people, not comfortable job, the life of errors and mistakes, illusions and need to escape from yours circle. each character is a part from the others, like in the case of Matryoshka dolls. and this fact does Seinfeld unique.'"
'I like the bit where Jerry says funny things before and after the acting bits'
"The beginning season were amazing!! Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much."
"I started watching Greys Anatomy in Season 4 and I liked it. Its focues on Doctors in Seattle who do different operations in every show and they also have steamy sex with their loved ones. Patrick Dempsey in this is so obnoxious in this programme I swear to god he goes on and on about how wonderful he is and that the bloody hospital is in fact his. Grr I hate Dr Shepard but I adore Dempsey though as he is sexy and very respectable. The charcthers are OK,the procedures they do in this programme is sometimes gross e.g one of them had a pencil stuck in their eye,opening up people's stomachs.I liked the season 6 finale in Grey's as Dr Shepard gets shot by some guy who wanted revenge as his wife died in the hospital and he bought a gun and shot some of the staff along with Dr Shepard. I was like NO!!.Its a great show and I liked it even though I never saw the season 1 of it."
"I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother. Anyway, it has become Ally McBeal meets ER now rather than St. Elsewhere."
"'I admittedly stopped watching this show in season 10, but feel I invested enough time to still leave a review. This show started out so good, well developed characters, heart wrenching storylines... but once the main characters started to leave, the show was over. But Ellen Pompeo continues to drag this show through the battlefield of fallen characters, every natural disaster you can think of, and every hairbrained medical mishaps on this planet and the next.'"
"Literally and metaphorically speaking. It's the most disjointed show I know, quality wise. The first round (season 1 to 4) only had two great seasons, 2 and 3. The second (season 5 to 8) is so boring around the second half of season 7, you wonder why bother watching the 8th. Fortunately proving you wrong, when you do, because it's one of the best the show's ever had, with 6 and 3, so far. Adding season 2 and 5 as my personal pick. Then part three (from season 9 to 11) is where the quality and genuineness, left the hospital. I even consider season 11 finale last shot to bring the series closure. And the following season to be part of a different chapter, for die hard fans only. Which I'm clearly not, because from season 12 onward, I stopped following it on TV, and only watch episodes whenever I felt like it, or curious about the music placements (which is without a doubt, one of the highlights of the whole series). I can't really blame the acting, it's good overall. But the writing got extremely ridiculous and repetitive after a while. Pushing more commonplaces and other biases, Â« narrow minded Â» people like me hate so much... All in all, it's a good medical drama, that often leans towards soap opera territory at more than one occasion. But it didn't age well, both in the way it picks subjects and characters to focus on."
"Definitely one of the best fantasy series ever. I don't think I ever saw a better one. At least I can't remember a better one. I write this after the seventh season and it's still as good as the beginning. That's says it all. The acting is excellent. There are so many different characters, clans and families that it could be difficult to follow if you didn't pay attention. But all the characters are worth watching, every single one of them. And don't get too attached to a character because it could be over for him or her in any episode. Never saw so many main characters being killed or murdered as in Game Of Thrones. And that's a real good thing because there is always an element of surprise. In every season characters that you would think will survive die. The battles are epic, the story could go in any direction anytime. Betrayals, violence, conquests, incestuous affairs, the show has everything. I'm a devoted fan, so devoted I already have three tattoos about it. House Targayen rules!"
"'I understand that George R. R. Martin based A Song of Ice and Fire on various and sundry wars and conquests throughout Europe\'s history. Indeed, the characters on Game of Thrones seem to have no aim except to fight for control of Westeros. It is as though their quest for prestige has become an excuse to spend eternity fighting.I should note that this show is not for children. It\'s one of the most violent shows that I\'ve ever seen. Seriously, they leave little to the imagination. I\'ve never read the books on which the series is based, but the series doesn\'t dumb anything down (understanding of course that it\'s fantasy).Having just binge-watched the first season, I recommend the show. Really impressive.'"
"This is a television drama series starring Damian Lewis as an ambitious hedge fund king and Paul Giamatti as a relentless and tough U.S. Attorney.Just saw the (unaired) pilot and it is more than obvious that this series is designed to impress. There is a slow building of the set-up. Bit by Bit of information until you get the whole picture of what is happening and the connection between the main characters. Unfortunately is that connection that makes me hold a small basket. The relation between the characters is stronger than it first appear and makes it a borderline soap opera. I really hope it doesn't get into one.Anyway, you have some credible actors, you get to see glimpses on how the upper 1% of the world lives (which is always a selling point since Dallas and Dynasty) plus you may learn a couple of things about the stock-market and funds and other ...mystical things that most people don't know about and could make a guy billionaire in a day or so.Overall: Nothing spectacular so far, but the set-up of the pilot made clear what you are about to see in the 12 episodes of the 1st season. 2 men (yet not 2 different worlds) will collide in a pissing contest (as it is clearly said in the pilot). Who will win? Only one way to find out..."
"'I know popcorn-epics like Spider-Man can\'t dwell over every little detail, but director Sam Raimi is so hectic and insistent on pushing this thing along, he loses the narrative punch in the F/X muddle. The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with \'bigger and better\' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****'"
"'What begins as a standoff between two authority figures in a dramatic setting turns, as the seasons go by, to satire, comedy and lastly into a morbid pastiche showcasing master class motivation and morality.In doing so it should lose credibility as series but instead ends up looking more and more like the real world in which we live in. Turns out the joke is on the rest of us.'"
"'Had they toned down the sarcasm, and flip attitude, this might have been watchable. I tried hard to get through the first season, but the incessant attempts to be humorous were brittle, not funny, and wore me out. It took the fun out of what was a great premise, and though I love this genre, I could not get past episode four.Also, the woman lead was a bit too me too. She had zero connection with her femininity, and way too much shame about appearing semi nude in a show that took place years ago. She was essentially playing a good looking man.This could have been so much better.'"
"Their are sooo many reasons why this new TV show should not work.For starters, the religious aspects of it. Then you have the done- so-many-times-before teaming up with the police factor. Then you have the typical sexist issues relevant in this show. And so on, and so on. BUT, it did work, and very well so!From the first episode, I had my doubts, but you couldn't help enjoying each character, especially Tom Ellis playing the role of the devil. Combining all of these characters, considering their respective religious earthly roles, then adding the factor of solving crimes, was actually very entertaining.Setting this show in Los Angeles and its associated lifestyle/nightlife was a huge plus.As the show progressed, I was curious to see what more can happen. Well, a lot did, and it was all executed perfectly.Props to the writers and director for finally taking many clichÃ©s, and bundling them up, mixing them around and creating a hit TV show!I hope this show keeps renewing its seasons, and look forward to see what happens next!It's a 9/10 from me!"

Well, a lot did, and it was all executed perfectly.Props to the writers and director for finally taking many clichÃ©s, and bundling them up, mixing them around and creating a hit TV show!I hope this show keeps renewing its seasons, and look forward to see what happens next!It's a 9/10 from me!"
"Lucifer is a great show, a lot of it is the charming and amusing devil we all love to see. The strength of this show is the balance it strikes between the detective work and the biblical/divine elements. The greatest punch is delivered when one drives the other. Lucifer made a strong start and I think the first seasons were it's best. Low points include too much of the detective work and less biblical elements, it then resembles CSI more and more. You don't want another detective show. Less time should also be devoted to side characters like Maze. They are often used as space fillers for no good reason, characters should appear when needed. Overall not too bad. I hope there are more episodes. 7.8/10"
"I gave season one and two of this show a much deserved 10/10 but I'm at a loss to understand why they made season 3?Season 3 is the antithesis of the former seasons. It ruins the mostly light hearted vibe that had been established, replacing it with something much darker. Worse still, its simply, in many respects, a blatant re-hash of what went before.Like Star Wars, this feels like making something for the sake of making it. I'm happy to have had the first two seasons and will be leaving it there.5/10 for season 3."
"If you like movies like the italian job, than this show is for you. The drama doesn't really go off track when it came to presenting a well planed heist. Although there were some predictable parts, the overall result was wonderful. The performances were, as well, top notch. Another plus about this series is that the pace is well managed, so, even though the events take place during the course of a few days, the audiance doesn't fell bored. However, I do feel a bit uneasy about season three, as the heist is over after season two."
"This t.v. show is excellent, it's one of my favorites. Everything about it is excellent, acting, characters, story lines, plots, production, costumes, photography, directing, script and expression. Although, I like everyone on the show my favorite character is Abby.My favorite episode is the one when that brutal vicious, monster killer, Kyle Boone was executed. He deserved to be killed after all the horrible things he did. My biggest question is, why would he keep the locations of his victims' bodies a secret for so long? How could he not just tell them and let their families bury them and have closure? He kept everyone in so much pain.Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. 10 out of 10 stars. Two Thumbs Way Up!"
"'An investigative team within NCIS solve US Navy based crime. Like procedurals such as CSI there\'s lab work, morgue pathology scenes and field work with gun-wielding ex-marines and agents. There\'s humour, heart, good plots and silly one-liners. Often the cases can be dangerous with suspense, gory bits and emotional scenes where their private life issues impact on work. There are great, varied characters from the goth vampy science lab-rat Abby (Pauley Perrette), British Pathologist Ducky (David McCullum), wise-cracker playboy DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) lead by their commander Gibbs (Mark Harmon) to, in some of the series, the fabulous tough-gal ex-Mossad agent Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) who all bring various aspects to the stories.Like all procedurals, there are some jumps of supposition, and like all similar American programs it\'s a bit formulaic, and can be silly and predictable, with some cheese, but it\'s great television, very watchable and the cases - being military - are slightly different from the normal city-cop version of this sort of program you usually get. It\'s an enjoyable watch with something for everyone. Easily the best US murder/investigative procedural on TV at present.'"
"I guess years ago I watched; I put up with more and would watch a slow 4 star. And early on, it wasn't as repetitious. Barely entertaining. boring, bad acting. I didn't like the characters and the plot lines were mundane. The thing I hated most, was Mark Harmon as the wise kind father figure, who protects and likes women. Having met him once, before NCIS, I was offended in a very casual exchange. Michael now has a spin off, always seemed way too full of himself. OK, he was a model. Reading some on set problems, with Pauly speaking out about being terrorized, and what happened to Cote, forced to leave? They were too popular. And others with both Mark and Michael on his set, I see my perceptions of them were correct. Now, you can say who they are shouldn't influence how I perceive their performances. but who they are showed in their performances. Smug. Neither are the best actors. I thought People's sexy man of the year for Mark Harmon years ago was laughable. I do think, it is fair to look at an actor, and say, I don't like you, as an actor and for what you've done.\nBeside that, the story lines and characters are just boring. Sure. it's hard to get a new spin on an old theme. But that's no excuse."
"'...but Fight Club is much more intriguing in its smaller moments, where it finds a surreal, dream-like quality that seems to snake around at will. The film is tough and unyielding in its machismo, and although it is occasionally off-putting, I was never bored watching it. The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well. But I felt the filmmakers slipped at the final gate, wherein the script concocts a major plot-twist that just doesn\'t jell, leading everyone to look a little foolish. **1/2 from ****'"
"'One of the better ones!\nReally liked it!Specifically the dark,industrial,almost Gothic look and feel to it...\nacting is fine,story is very interesting,overall very enjoyable gangster saga!'"
"'Nice series, but the fifth season is very disappointing'"
"I could barely watch this. i only kept going cause i wanted to see my boy tommyseries 1: 3\nsuper duper boring. crappier version of boardwalk empire. seemed to be generally well made until some ridiculously stupid stuff started happening... (1 viewing)\nSPOILERS\n...like when the gangs are about to shoot each other, the sister comes in between with her baby and tells them they shouldn't kill each other. doesn't work but still so stupid, and when the shooting starts it's ridiculous and absurd. how are a group of 30 men going to allow an opponent to walk out in front and shoot their boss in the head smh. dumbest thing ever. also some super basic subplots like the estranged father who shows up out of nowhere wanting something and convincing a son to trust him before inevitably betraying him. i feel like some of the subplots could have been from old sitcoms like boy meets world or fresh prince.\n*********************************************************************Series 2: 4\neh. too boring. i quit (1 viewing)"
"At first I thought who needs to see all this again but once I started watching it I was hooked. The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.The A list cast is hit and miss. Cuba Gooding is an enthusiastic actor but too small in size to play OJ. He looks shorter than the other male actors around him. Should have chosen someone more physically imposing. Sarah Paulson looks enough like Marcia Clark with the wig. Surprisingly David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian looks like him if you check out photos. John Travolta as Shapiro has some strange eyebrows but he is fascinating to watch. Selma Blair as Kris Kardashian is also a good fit. Connie Britton looks a bit too healthy to be Faye Resnick but these are all people you like to see on screen. The link with the Kardashians is quite interesting to watch.Well done and very voyeuristic and entertaining."
"'During the 21st century, Ryan Murphy has been one of the people revolutionizing TV. With American Horror Story, he looked at humanity\'s capacity for evil. Now he brings us American Crime Story, about some bad things that have happened in the US during the past few decades.I just watched the first season, focusing on the O.J. Simpson trial. In addition to giving a sense of how weird the rich Angeleno culture is, it makes clear that you couldn\'t separate race from the trial. Having watched the verdict read on TV back when it happened, I know how charged the atmosphere was. This has become all the more relevant since George Floyd\'s murder.I understand that season two focuses on Gianni Versace\'s murder, and how you couldn\'t separate homophobia from the story. Without a doubt, our country has a lot of issues to deal with.The point is, this is a show that draws you in, even if you know the story. I recommend it.'"
"When it comes to cutting edge dramas, no one does it well like FX. The first entry in the American Crime Story series, the People vs. OJ Simpson, recreates the moments when OJ fled the scene of a murder in one of the most popular crime stories of all time. There are some changes to make it different from real life, but the casting is well done and the way its shot is good. The music and soundtrack is well done, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is pretty good as OJ. I'm sure FX will do good with the story based on Hurricane Katrina and its impact on America. I think it's better than American Horror Story and more educational for young people like me."
"'This sci-fi/horror series stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard,\nNatalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton and Millie Brown. This takes place in Indiana town, Hawkins during the 1980\'s and centers around single mother, Joyce Byers (Ryder), her son, Jonathan (Heaton), Police Chief, Jim Hopper (Harbour), Young boy, Mike Wheeler (Wolfhard), Mike\'s sis, Nancy (Dyer) and mysterious, young girl, Eleven (Brown) who has special powers. This is a good, suspenseful series with a decent cast, mainly Ryder and good, atmospheric score that has a Tangerine Dream & John Carpenter feel. \nThere\'s also a Spielberg tone, obviously E.T. and aspects of The X-Files, \nA Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing. If you grew up in the 80\'s as I did or enjoy sci-fi/horror, I recommend checking this out.'"
"'Since its debut last year, Netflix\'s Stranger Things has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will\'s disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there\'s the contrast between Will\'s family and Mike\'s family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn\'t disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will\'s distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her cute roles, then you\'re in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.And remember, the bad men are coming.*I understand that the show\'s creators tracked down the makers of the era\'s board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries.'"
It takes a long time to settle down and it feels like they do not know who the target audience is yet.\nHaving said that as long as you don't think too hard its silly and occasionally violent fun.
'2 episodes in.\nbetter then Gotham.\nbloody.\nI thought it would be more teen drama ha ha.\nrecommended .\n-------------------------------\n10 episoides in.\nit lost some mojo and stories as it goes on. disappointed now.'
"'Like The Sixth Sense, this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can\'t say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt\'s character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton\'s narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter\'s role in here. I couldn\'t take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that nasty seems to be so appealing to kids these days.'"
"At first glance I didn't know what to think but after watching the first episode and then following it, growing to love the characters in live-action form and getting addicted of the show I have to say it's one fine TV show. It's dark tone separates the animated show I watched as a kid and made this experience more mature and much more how I like shows now days, character driven stories with great character development and characters. Something the creators succeeded with is the characters, making them human and believable, Hank and Dawn was two of my favorites, well written and likeable. I also really liked Brenton Thwaites' portrayal of Dick Grayson, the brutal side of him was something that I didn't like at first but after watching I grew to love it.The choreography for the brutal fight scenes were one of the highlights, the brutal nature made it feel real. The other highlights are the characters and story, the dark tone of the story is something original, I found it very enjoyable with following the Titans on their journey."

"I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better."
"'This is one of those top of the league series. Once you start watching you can\'t stop it. My wife and I were completely hooked on this series. Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can\'t do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If Better Call Saul is in the same way then it can\'t go wrong. Anyways, Breaking Bad is a must-see if you never saw it.'"
"'This show is plain out memorable and one of the shows that should not be missed. It revolves around greed, revenge and redemption. These elements has been portrayed in other shows before. But not as articulately, intricately and meticulously done as this show (or at least I have seen so far). This show boosted Bryan Cranston career and popularity for good reason. Walter White aka Heisenberg has become one of the most iconic television characters. Some show has a first season that is good and starts to go downhill from there. This is a show that has a good first season and it keeps getting better and better until the grand finale, with a exquisitely stand out ending. It\'s like Vince Gilligan the creator of the show planned just about the main jist of the story when it comes to the 5 season all out from the beginning. With it\'s high adrenaline build up that build and builds while staying consistent and relevant through out the whole thing. With the chemistry between characters and transformation, thus the title Breaking Bad. This is a show I would recommend people to stick through few episodes and there is a high chance that it will hook them. This show is a downright great mix of serious drama and comedy. Overall without giving anything much away, this is a well written show with great character developments that is worth checking out.9.3/10'"
"Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV."
'I don\'t need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don\'t know already that if you go to talk to the investigators that you don\'t just say I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer. And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent.'
"for me,this is the best of the Law and Order Franchise.i really like the good mix of characters.they are well written and defined and the show goes in depth with them,both in their professional and personal lives.the show is also very edgy,and dark.it pushes the envelope.plus,there's more action than the original Law and Order,and Law and Order:Criminal Intent.i find the original Law and Order to be more of a procedural drama,so it's more about the drama.as for Law and Order:Criminal Intent,i find it lacks the edge of SVU.both of those other shows have their merits,but for me,Law and Order:Special Victims Unit is the best of the bunch."
'I like the bit where it goes doot doot in between sections of the show'
"'In my opinion this is the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made. The journey of Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring is outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. My vote is ten.'"
"'An unknown bad guy (Javier Bardem) has obtained the list of all NATO nation covert operatives working inside terrorist cells. As he threatens to release them, an aged Bond (Daniel Craig) who appears to have lost a step, must go to Shanghai and appear in the obligatory casino scene and attempt to get back the computer file. This feature has the standard Bond lines, killer title track, sensual scenes, over the top chase action, as well as a return to Bond\'s roots.Judi Dench as M was superb. Adele singing the title track, who else? The Bond series has kept up with the times as expected and leaves sequel possibilities open. Good action flick, although I do not consider this to be the best Bond film ever or even close. It lacked the fun gag names that makes for great spoofs, but did use Silva, the name of our bad guy from the urban dictionary: Silvas are typically the most handsome men one will ever come across in person. A silva is a strong, sexy, and successful individual that doesn\'t need anyone but himself. Worth a peek on the big screen.Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, sensual scenes that implied sex, no nudity.'"
"'I don\'t really have anything to say; read George Orwell\'s essay on No Orchids for Miss Blandish and discover why it\'s all been said before, better than I could say it.Obviously the show is cruddy enough on aesthetic grounds: I don\'t know whether to blame the wooden acting or the 100%-exposition dialogue, so let\'s blame both. But people are willing to overlook such things on TV in the interests of fantasy. I am too. What\'s depressing is that people are willing to overlook the lousiness of the production in the interests of what they\'re really getting out of the show: the chance to watch the hounds chase the fox for an hour, until the latter collapses of exhaustion.What\'s also depressing is that this show is part of a trend. In the past, a leading-up-to-the-trial kind of TV show would have focused on the defence lawyers; it\'s a shame that we\'re now getting a kick out of siding with the prosecution, especially when it\'s this bunch of deeply unpleasant people.Perry Mason didn\'t have a mean streak.'"
"I really loved this show in the beginning. Cool scripts, acting on point and focused on crime solving. Opinions were absent. Later, politics took over the show, too bad. It's now all about Mariska, Mariska, Mariska - definitely wandered away from crime solving into raising a child and crying tears. I have plenty of old shows and movies to watch...this one is off my list now. Time to cancel."
"Really the show was best with Steve Carell at the helm. As he played Michael Scott, a not too bright but still meant well boss. With a mockmentary of what happens at a business in the what else...office! With a bunch and assortment of characters. As Carell despite being the focus and center of attention. Does his best to hold it together as Michael Scott. But it far, far too often fails.Really Carell's nervous boss while trying to keep it together is what made the show great. And it is really missed. John Krasinki is great as Jim the perfect straight man to Carell's Michael Scott. With others like Rain Wilson, BJ Novak, among the others supporting players to back them up.No offense to James Spader who took over for Carell as he is now pursuing a film career. But the show belonged to Carell. As he is really missed!"
"'Greetings from Lithuania.The only word that best describes this show is BRILLIANT. Stunning acting, writing and directing (of each episode).I saw all episodes of this amazing TV show and I can tell you people, this show rocks!!! The cast is amazing!I love the characters who are from real life. It\'s really the perfect show. The show is funny because it sets up literally, the most awkward situations possible.In my country, i\'m working in the office, and i can tell you, the things this they show in The Ofiice are REAL. Whe even have our own Dwight K. Shrute!This is a truly brilliant comedy, bar far one of the best shows on TV, and with the way it is going, it will continue to reign supreme.Enjoy it for what it is. If you do, you\'ll find yourself laughing so hard, tears come to your eyes. That\'s always good fun.'"
"'I probably should give this show more of a chance, but I was so incredibly uncomfortable during it, I probably won\'t watch it again. Most of the time, British comedies, when taken over by Americans, don\'t seem to make it. Fawlty Towers, which lasted all of five minutes, comes to mind. This appears to be one of them. There were some very funny moments, and I suspect they were taken right out of the British version.The boss, plain and simple, is a complete moron. Totally out of it, he thinks he\'s a role model and hilariously funny, when all the while he\'s a sexual harasser who makes racist remarks, does Three Stooges impressions, and is emotionally abusive (firing his secretary for stealing as a practical joke and bringing her to tears). It\'s a great setup for a fabulous character, but I found him only annoying.I\'m afraid my attitude is closest to that of the temp\'s: embarrassed, appalled, and not finding much funny.'"
"The Office regardless of the British version is probably one of the best comedies out there. Steve Carrell is a comic genius and I remember him from his days at the Daily Show on Comedy Central. The other cast members are really unknown. They look like office workers that you and I work beside five days a week. His character of Michael Scott is purely genius. This guy is somebody we all know who thinks he's all that and a bag of chips but he's not. The characters in the Office do need to be more clear. They are all rather vague so far to me. Sometimes, I don't know who is which but I can tell you something. This show makes me want to watch it again because I work in an office and I have colleagues like them too. When they were standing outside during a fire, it was interesting to see that a simple fire like a toaster burning because the new temp and business school college student left something there in the wrong spot. They made the experience watchable and interesting to see who would do who on a desert island much like Lost and what movies they would see. I bet there are people who have the same movies on their list too. Long live the Office."
"How willing would you be to eat nothing but bitter tasting spoiled food just to say you did it? Watching this series reminded me of that. What's the point of listening to the same internal rude deprecating dialogue of a stalker as he plans his victim's demise for 10 episodes (7.5 hours)? The usual artificial, not real, characterizations including girl's night out partying, drinking & talking hook-ups. Lot's of famous author's name dropping for some reason. Stalker able to avoid the most obvious forensic detective investigations (actually none) to continue the series. Victims, of course, are less than perfect humans so the sympathy angle is out."
I give 9 rating bcz of some plot holes\nI don't know why I can't decide to love Joe or hate him
"We get to hear our stalker narrate 10 episodes (over 8 hours) as he plans his victims' demise. The usual artificial, not real, flashbacks of a dysfunctional childhood. Stalker able to avoid the most obvious forensic detective investigations (actually almost none which makes this series seem technically fake). Victims, of course, are less than perfect humans so the sympathy angle is out. Screen time is 90+% predictable dialogue talking heads I made good use, in saving my time, by ff. Might need help if this was an enjoyable passing the time entertainment."
"Note: I have seen seasons 1 & 2.You can be most closely related to the TV show Dexter. Both shows really take the time to explore the psychology behind a psychopath's actions. You's dialogue flawlessly manages to present Joe's delusions in a way where the viewer can see both why he believes he is correct and how flawed his delusions really are. Getting the audience to simultaneously feel sympathy and disgust for a character is extremely difficult, yet You was able to do it exceptionally well.However similar the lead characters may be, Dexter is ultimately a crime show while You is a more realistic horror. Each moment in You gives strong vibes that this could really happen in the real world, which makes the viewer feel even more unsettled. Although just as reality is mostly uninteresting, You can also occasionally present conversations and events normally seen in a standard drama that aren't entirely interesting. Those down times aren't too numerous though, so the show remains quite enjoyable throughout.Season 1 - Excellently written to explain how bad people can justify their actions. 7/10Season 2 - Still very interesting, but it tries to make Joe more relatable, which ends up losing part of the first season's essence. Also the conclusion turns into a badly written soap opera, though it does give 3 of the main characters the chance to give some powerful performances. 5/10"

If Sauron reclaims the Ring, Middle-earth is doomed, according to the DVD sleeve description, Winner of four \'Academy Awards\', this epic tale of good versus evil, friendship and sacrifice will transport you to a world beyond imagination.

It\'s a job that\'s never started that takes the longest to finish, someone said. Writer/director Peter Jackson\'s The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of an extremely well-produced trilogy. Understandably, it\'s made into a special effects extravaganza, without taking many breaths for thoughtfulness.The Bridge of Khazad-DÃ»m (#30 on your DVD menu) sequence is a highlight; it climaxes with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the demonic Balrog (CGI) falling into an abyss, from which return seemed impossible This was one of my most memorable Lord of the Rings reading experiences - a future without Gandalf was unimaginable.

"This was one interesting show, essentially it defined comedy for the millenial\ngeneration.Three men, three women typical of young people as they like to see themselves\ndecide to room together in New York City, rents being what they are. The women\nwere Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston,and Courtney Cox. The guys are David\nSchwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc.With six characters from different backgrounds there was a chance to bring\nin girlfriends, boyfriends, relations of all kinds in a whole range of plot situations for episodes. One of the reasons the show clicked.The bigger reasons was however the chemistry between the six. You can never\ntell, you just hope you make the right casting and the audience likes the ensemble. That's sheer luck at times.I know my nieces of the younger generation really dug this show as they\nentered their teen years. I kind of liked it myself"
'Better than all the rest... quite simply the best show of all time. Please may they never threaten to cancel this godsend of a program ever again I need to see them all grow old with me.'
"'Brooklyn Nine-Nine tells the story of a very special police department, in which a set of widely different characters fights crime and personal struggels in New York City.When I saw the first episodes, I wasn\'t fully convinced yet. In my opinion you take a moment to get to know all of the characters better and understand the special dynamic within the cast. But once you\'ve grown attached to them, you will soon notice how brilliantly producers managed to create a balance between episodal plots, steady characters and more serious moments, thus enabling a scenerie that never gets boring and gives you both surprising moments and a feeling of community with the characters. Surely there are more subtle and clever comedy shows, but it is refreshing to see that it is possible to create something this funny without relying on sophisticated approaches and the like.All in all I am looking forward to the episodes yet to come and meanwhile encourage anyone to do a binge-watching session and explore the potential of this extraordinary show.'"
"'Brooklyn nine nine was rewarding. The characters are likable, funny and interesting. The small cases were pretty entertaining too. Some episodes were not as good as others, however, especially in the latest seasons.'"
'Better than all the rest... quite simply the best show of all time. Please may they never threaten to cancel this godsend of a program ever again I need to see them all grow old with me.'
"And had me hooked on James Spader's performance. The only performance worth noting as the rest, including co-star Megan Boone, are wooden. Granted, the quality of the script leaves a huge amount to be desired. A lot of gunfight at the OK corral shoot-em-ups, and plot holes to sink a battleship.You know it's awful when you realize that the main characters dodging all the bullets episode after episode leaves you pleading for them, once, to die already.And the FBI director? He gives wooden an entirely new definition. He seems to report to the newbie, Elizabeth Keen, who keeps the name of the man who tried to kill her. And she's a profiler always out of the office without a bullet proof vest in the middle of blow 'em to kingdom come battle scenes. Because sexy.I hate to see James wasted in such drivel. His performance is riveting. It would be downright amazing with a good script and less the endless shooting everywhere, all the time, forever and ever."
"'This millennium has seen blooming of series where events and characters are intertwined, and single episode does not have a fixed start and summarizing end. On the one hand, it is harder to follow as you basically have to see all episodes in succession, but, on the other hand, it lets to maintain thrill and confuse viewers in a skillful manner. Apparently on account of realism and smooth logic, but still... In my opinion, The Blacklist has all signs mentioned above, and thanks to fine performance of James Spader, interesting twists due to the list members and unpredictable characters, the total course of events is interest to follow, and inclusion of a talented Swedish actor Peter Stormare for the next season has made me a true follower who is ready to recommend the series to all fond of sophisticated and peculiar crime series where mystery, emotions and opting between bad and worse are perpetual.'"
'In this high quality thriller James Spader is even more awesome than in Boston Legal. Sounds impossible? Check it out!8/10'
"'Raymond Reddington, number one on the FBI\'s Most Wanted List, which has been successfully avoided arrest for decades, suddenly appears at the FBI headquarters, surrenders and insists on talking exclusively with newcomer Detective Elizabeth Keen. The series has 6 seasons and 133 episodes so far, in which Reddington, in exchange for immunity, helps a secret branch of the FBI to catch the dangerous and powerful criminals that they did not even know existed. Each episode is a quality forty-minute thriller with own plot, while the characters of Reddington and Elizabeth gradually build through all episodes and deepen the mystery of why he surrendered and why he chose her specifically.Although he was not the first choice for the role and fell in the series just a couple of days before the shooting started, James Spader is even better here than in Boston Legal and I do not think that anybody could play the role of Reddington better. Megan Boone was initially annoying to me, but in time the man became accustomed to everything, so after six seasons I even became fond of her. The whole cast is good and their characterization is excellent. The script combines crime thriller with drama and occasional comic-relief moments. Technical quality is great and the show has a perfectly balanced pace so that it never loses the grip of your attention. I can not wait for the start of the seventh season scheduled for October this year.8/10'"
"'A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where an evil and spiritual presence influences the father (Jack Nicholson) into violence, while his psychic son (Danny Lloyd) sees horrific forebodings from the past and of the future.What is most interesting is that this film has gone from bad to good. When it first came out, the reviews were not so positive, and there were even some Golden Raspberry nominations (but no wins). Today, this is not only considered a top horror film but one of the top 100 films of any genre... what a turnaround.Then we have King\'s disappointment, and I think he raises serious concerns: he did not like the casting of Nicholson, and he did not think Kubrick made the film as horror-focused as it could have been. On the first point, it is true that the lead should have had a greater transition. Nicholson just looks crazy from the first scene. I would love to have seen Michael Moriarty...As for the Kubrick criticism, it is true... he bent over backwards to make an artsy, stylish film, but maybe not a horror film. It is a great film, but maybe not a great horror film. If you want a good haunting film, for example, The Changeling has this one beat...'"
"So enjoyable watching Dean and Sam experience everything bizarre or mysterious! Some hit or miss episodes that were meh then others that gave me the best feeling ever that make me definitely want to keep watching the journey. CW has quite a few shows I wouldn't recommend/ care where as Supernatural is amazing and the story tends to always have more excitement around the corner! The music couldn't be better, so much epicness to purify the soul."
"Even tho it got a little silly at times it was still a enjoyable watch and yes The Season 15 episodes felt like a mix of the old Supernatural and the new. These urban legends fit the aesthetic of the early seasons a lot better, but they're not entirely out of place. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 6/15/2021."
"Supernatural was the reigning king of entertainment during it's first five seasons by mixing different cultures and human driven stories together like a melting pot.Despite the lackluster plot, the mystery of what caused to two brothers, Sam and Dean Winchester, mother to die in a firey blaze hooked a large audience right away and helped the new CW show to soar to heights not seen before.It was intelligently written, had clever villains that could outwit the leads in the brains department and out up a good fight instead of making them an untouchable superman ahead of the game.They had to use research, skull and think of new ways to defeat the for keeping it refreshing.Having a sibling myself, it was nice to see the schisms and talks the brothers had after a hard day. It brought it down to a personal level of what defines and makes a family. A theme that resonates several times on the show all the way back to Cain and Abel to the apocalyptic fight between Michael and Lucifer.The humor is prevalent throughout when the boys use fake ids to Cain access to crime scenes, unintended sexual situations or their Angel friend Cas tries to understand how humanity ticks.The atmosphere was wonderful adding to the eerie campfire stories they were telling.While the show has gone down in quality in recent years there is still a spark left lit to enjoy."
"'Supernatural was an off-the-wall, brand new, super awesome show when I first watched. I was all in. Sam and Dean were cool and they were going Van Helsing on the underworId. I followed the adventures of Sam and Dean faithfully until Dean died and was pulled out of wherever-he-was by an angel. I can\'t even remember the season, but I just remember thinking, They\'re just throwing darts at a board now. I never expected it to keep going for as long as it did. It was good for the time I watched, but I\'m glad I got off the ride when I did.'"
"I still don't know what the hoopla is all about with this series. It's a costume drama set in 1912 in fictional Downton Abbey where there are plenty of servants and an aristocratic family. The cast is first rate led by Dame Maggie Smith among others. She is a scene stealer. The costumes, art direction, and sets are first rate. I have seen other British dramas with costumes and sets. This drama doesn't seem much different and I'm surprised by its success. I believe class differences between servants and the family to which they serve is considerable. The servants can be cutthroat and vicious. Just look at poor Bates in the first episode. There is plenty of drama going on in the servants quarters while their employers worry about their futures of their three daughters where marriage is the only answer."
"'If you thought Gosford Park needed to be a shallow, episodic TV series, you might enjoy this. Even Maggie Smith (and her character) has been borrowed wholesale to ease your transfer. And what luck, the theme music is a thinly veiled knock-off of the title music from The Piano. But Gosford Park wrestled with matters of substance, and showcased some striking film technique.This show is teeming with decent characters (translation: progressive) none of whom could have existed historically, and none of whom can inject the show with any surprises. The show shoots the bolt in the first two episodes where Lord Grantham defends and acts as co-equals with two different servants. Hooray for time-traveling with anachronistic values. The show never rises above soap opera by larding itself down with drippy conflicts, and boatloads of shallow female matters. The elevated estrogen level torpedoes any real intrigue.The drama in this is just so much sniveling.'"
"'One may not think that a show centered around stuffy British aristocrats and the legion of butlers, maids, cooks, footmen, and valets who serve them would make for riveting drama. But Downton Abbey proved as engrossing as any period drama I have seen , sucking viewers into the world of the Crawley family and their servants as both groups navigated the shifting social landscape of the early 20th Century. Downton Abby proved that a humble network like PBS can compete with the titans of the TV landscape. Downton Abbey is the embodiment of excellence. Well written with intelligent and inspiring storylines. The cast is superb and the show rises above the mediocrity. 10/10'"
"It's s a great show normally wth compelling and exciting episodes. It doesn't need the super villain.In fact this a class of villain which i call the omnipotent villain. In scifi there presence is arguable depending on whether they obey the rules or premises established by the story, but in reality based fiction they are by default unacceptable,The writers justify some of his ability with the smoke and mirrors of Garcia's game but it still leaves too much beyond anyone's abilities.Some shows need to raise the stakes, but this show doesn't, yet they will do it again many times."
"Everything about this show is good, really good.The story lines are clever and believable and the characters are perfect.Thomas Gibson is brilliant and holds the whole team together as Aaron Hotchner and Joe Mantegna as David Rossi is another great character.But then there is the amazingly good Matthew Gray Gubler as the weird and wonderful Dr. Spencer Reid and Shemar Moore as Derek Morgan shows that a black man can have a major part that isn't as a black man ( so many films stereo type black actors and this is a refreshing change)Jennifer Jareau played by A.J Cook is another well rounded character but then there is the brilliant Kirsten Vangsness as Penelope Garcia I miss Mandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon as his character was a lynch pin for the early episodes.The only character I didn't really like was Erin Strauss played by Jayne Atkinson. I felt that those episodes were more like a soap opera and Criminal minds was better than that.So pleased that this show is continuing and look forward to many more."
"'It is repetitive and some of the episodes painfully weak...From other side ,there are very well done stories too. Acting is decent,overall not a bad time killer!'"
"I have not yet watched the TV version of the Shining. You know the one Stephen King actually likes and prefers to Kubricks version of his novel. But I cannot imagine it being better than this one. And while I have not read the book King wrote (and therefor cannot tell you the differences of how you should feel about King not liking it), I do like this movie very much.Saying there is attention to detail would be one major understatement. There is a documentary who interprets all the details of the film and goes quite far out at times, but more on that elsewhere. The movie at hand has powerhouse performances. Watching some behind the scenes footage, gives you quite the feeling of what went on.Some may have had issues with the way Kubrick went on to do things, the amount of takes he demanded, the way he behaved allegedly and much more. But the results on the screen speak for themselves. You may not like horror movies and yet still find something here. You also may like horror movies and think this isn't a horror movie at all. It's not easy, but he knows what he's doing and he plays the viewer like a fidel - relax and let it happen"
'I don\'t need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don\'t know already that if you go to talk to the investigators that you don\'t just say I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer. And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent.'
Every time this show is on TV I cringe. The writing sucks. The acting sucks. Nothing is believable. It's violent in a bad way. Everyone in the show looks bored. It's just a horrible TV procedural. One of the worst shows I've ever seen.
"'Funny enough got into show twice , first when aired on TV and. Got to end of mid season 2 as life gets in the way , I lost track and could not get into it.Early in the year I got Netflix and got back into there series . I would say first 2 season were the best,Season 3 and rest were really enjoyable and great to watch and the sone if final season shocked me to core.Lao msny great twist and turns that I did. Not see coming , which kept me on toes to see the next episodes.There were nights I could stop watching ep after after ep and bad gripped.I liked the first al season of the show , I was not to sure what to make if the ending at all I did not love but I did not hate either'"
"At least it has Simon Pegg in it, who Hugh was based on. And I kind of can't picture the show without his involvement.It's not as Garth Ennis as I think it should be, it's not as vulgar and offensive and fun as he usually is, and certainly as The Boys was in print... but it comes really close to making that mark, and that is a breath of fresh air given the way that both comic books, and the movies they are based on are going.Ultimately, it's still vulgar, offensive, bloody and funny, even if it could have been more.And it's only 8 episodes, which seems a lot like they aren't trying to drag the story out just to add more, and that is also refreshing.Ultimately, it's a cure for modern comics in a very late 90s British Invasion kind of way"
"For example: In Episode 7, they were blown and ran into underground in a safe house, the young Romeo Hughie still kept calling Annie but got no answer. Hey, you guys didn't know they could trace back the location where you were hiding with your cell phone? And the other guy Frenchie still on his laptop? Jesus, this is the common sense even a guy like me would know when being hunted, the first thing you do is either dump your phone, or turn it off, or take the sim card out and snip it in half or whatever to make you disappear from the cyber space, still used your phone and got on line with your laptop? Jesus.....@#$?!"
"'Hugh Campbell, bereaved after his girlfriend is carelessly shredded by superhero speedster A-Train, falls in with Billy Butcher who regards it as his role in life to hold superheroes, and their mentoring organisation Vought, accountable for their actions.I have just binged series 1 and 2. I am a long-time fan of Garth Ennis\' savagely deconstructionist comic, on which this TV series is based. I am self-aware enough to recognise that part of my enjoyment comes from its base appeal - the sex, bad language, disgusting behaviour and extreme violence are all part of the appeal, although the genuine humanity, compassion, and emotional heart are equally important.The TV series captures all this. The broad story arc remains the same although much of the detail differs significantly enough that you never know what\'s coming next, which keeps the series fresh. All the cast members are excellent. Karl Urban enjoys playing Butcher, whose outward good humour covers seething anger. But towering over everything is Antony Starr\'s Homelander, a Superman equivalent whose square-jawed posturing disappears the minute the cameras are turned off, to be replaced by an arrogant disregard for everyone else. The power of Starr\'s performance derives from the fact that he also makes us see a damaged and partly sympathetic child within the monster.Beware - this is not a superhero series for children. The sex is frank, the violence is graphic, and the language is eye-wateringly foul and constant.'"

"One of the coolest anti hero series ever! Beautifully filmed especially in 4K and entirely well acted! So much fun, brutal, epic soundtrack, and very intriguing throughout; I'd recommend this to anyone! Easily top best shows to me!"
'Stopped after i was almost done with the 5th episode. from what i saw it as alright at best'
'I finally got to see this as it\'s running on Prime and am surprised at its popularity. The opening scene featuring slashing swords and a body littered battleground which was as devoid of real blood and gore as was the A-Team series . And there isn\'t a lot here with plot either: Ragnar wants to find the fabled English Coast so he can kill monks or whoever he finds and add to the Viking hoard of loot whereas the Earl says no. So Ragnar sails off anyway and upsets the status quo. As hokey as it was I found the Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas film The Vikings at least a hoot. Guess if you like your pseudo history easy to follow and accompanied by decent production values then this is your cup of mead.'
"Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) is a former teacher trying to do some writing. He gets a job to watch the Overlook Hotel for the winter with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and child Danny. Danny has an imaginary friend and premonitions of future horrors. The family arrives at the hotel just as it is closing up. Danny continues to have visions. The chef Dick Hallorann is able to communicate with Danny telepathically. Dick calls this 'shining'. Danny asks about room 237 and Dick tells him to stay out. A month later, Jack's writing is going nowhere and he's growing more distance.As a horror, this is not scary. It doesn't make you turn away from the screen. There is not a thrilling drama or an exciting action movie. This is simply art and nothing less. Director Stanley Kubrick is impeccable in his vision. It imparts a mood of foreboding. There is a feeling of wrongness about every scene of this movie. It makes the audience uneasy. There is a creepiness that haunts."
"'it is not entertainment and it is not a history lesson. it represents only a honest exercise to present, understand and define a world in more realistic manner than others movies. it is cruel, violent and impressive. it has the saga flavor but, in same measure, it is a definition of a society not very different by ours. and that is the basis of this spectacular series. not violence or special effects. only a competition in a circle of faith, fear and need of social success. so , a portrait. who not recreate a period but define it in a delicate, precise manner. a series about values and sense of fight. and , in essence, a kind of mirror. because the ambitions, the gestures, the revolt are parts of each society. important in this case is the courage to not cover this society in fairy-tale silk.'"
"'The series was very funny in the first three seasons, but in the fourth season the jokes became bad and highly anticipated. The series lost the thing that was characteristic of it. The series is no longer as fun as the previous one. If it ended in the third season, 10/10 the last season would have destroyed the series. I recommend watching the first three seasons only.'"
'I hate cartoons but this one is a exception I gareat mix with comedy and a dark said of the world'
"I rarely give an animated series a 10, but this one deserves it.It's fast, it's incredibly creative, it's incredibly smart, it's got a budget, and that budget appears to be spent on talented individuals who treat it like a true labor of love.What does that creative team eat for breakfast?Warning: Adult language and situations. The main adult lead, Rick, is by turns unfathomably jaded and outwardly blase, with occasion twinges of true humanity. The beauty of that is, when he does show these twinges, they whup you upside the haid.The Pilot was a tad shaky, but it seems to have only taken one episode to become a rick-roaring phenom.Check it out!"

"This show is a complete mess! Every character has somehow completely went insane. I hate every single one of them. There's the same ridiculous plot lines. It's never end. They especially love to add random sex scenes. And the one couple I keep hoping for (that's not toxic) won't end up together. And I mean Betty and Archie. But, we just get the same old toxic couple pairings. I really want to skip the whole show and stop but, it's such a train wreck. How could I? I suggest start with season 1 and finish at season 2."
"The main problem of Riverdale is it does not make any sense. I would not be okay even if they were all in college. But guess what, they are in high school. I love high school dramas. But I couldn't love Riverdale. Because it is so funny and absurd in every way possible. I liked the first season. They had a purpose to find who killed Jason, Betty being a highschool girl etc. It also had it bad moments but I was fine with that. Then came season 2 and slowly the series began to crash. I didn't know if it could go further bad after watching the final episodes of season 2. Then came season 3 with more bad writing and bad moments. The 21st episode gave me a small hope though as they slowly unveiled the mysteries. But the final episode just was the same old Riverdale which sucks. I don't know what they are going to do in season 4 but still going to watch."
"I'm stunned by just how many episodes they've managed to churn out, talk about over egging the pudding. The characters transform inexplicably from week to week, and everything is so absurd, that 99% of it is impossible to comprehend. Yet there is something rather addictive about it, sure it's full of beautiful people, but there are some really interesting characters too, Cheryl in particular, great fun. They have recycled scenes from Carrie, Halloween, and just about every movie you can think of, but who cares, this is low brow, trashy, hugely enjoyable escapism. I would never repeat watch it, but I'll always sit down to a new series. 7/10"
"'Modern Family' more than deserves to be recongised as not only one of the best comedies of the 2000's, but also amongst the best ever.Sharply written (by several 'Frasier' alum no less) and wonderfully performed by a fantastic cast, this show was near perfection for its first 7 years.Like all good shows though it did decline in later years, while of course still being able to come up with exceptional episodes along the way, but the writers did seem to run out of logical new stories and ways of developing the kids when they grew up.Overall though, this was a fantastic show, and one I will revisit regularly."
"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, LÃ©on (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardÂSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with LÃ©on rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is LÃ©on's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from LÃ©on. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
"'I see it as an experiment in the domain of TV series. or just a challenge. because it propose old themes, from family to friendship. but it has the courage or madness/eccentricity to put this themes in a real new package. and the result is not always comfortable. first - because the limits of humor are very, very far. second - because it reflects the XXI century in the most precise manner, with its aspects of Babel Tower to the sexual minorities and parenthood, Ed O Neill and Sofia Vergara as a delicious couple and Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson in a form of chemistry who seems escaping from every rule. so, an experiment. easy to love it. more easy to criticize it. and this is not exactly a bad thing.'"
"It's the adventures of an extended family. Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) is the patriarch with younger new wife Gloria Delgado (SofÃ\xada Vergara) and stepson Manny (Rico Rodriguez). His gay son Mitchell Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Mitchell's partner Cameron Tucker (Eric Stonestreet) are adopting a baby girl. Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) with three children; Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould).Ed O'Neill is TV royalty. Having Sofia Vergara as his wife is simple comedic genius. She is a Latina more cartoonish Peggy. Bowen and Burrell are the perfect comedic married couple. The kids are great. At the beginning, Ferguson and Stonestreet brings the show to a next level of relevance. The genius there is that the guys are lovable and regular folk. They normalize a gay married couple and them adopting a baby. These are likeable people in a likeable family. Their simple loveliness is their best aspect. It lasted eleven seasons with a diminishing return over the years. It's good."
"Modern Family hit the ground running as a unique, sharp and witty show. It didn't have the standard laugh track and got the audience to react to what they thought was funny. The unique and modern characters and their interactions made for some good laughs here and there. Despite its decent start the show proved it was not sustainable and fallen off the radar over the years. It is not what it used to be and sometimes tries too hard. It has gotten to the stage in its life cycle where only its devoted fan base tune in."

"'Some good cinematography, other than that nothing about this show impressed me. and it did a horrendous job of getting me hooked or invested in the story. i was bored for most of the episode, and then the action scenes were just fine. i watched 4 episodes. i quit (1 viewing 1/2020)'"
"Definitely lives up to the hype and is exactly what a Star Wars series should be! Filmed incredibly well, exhilarating to watch everything play out, deserving of awards, and the characters are magnificent! I almost could've watched sooner but glad I finally got around to it now."
"'I tried to like The Big Bang Theory. I really tried. However, after seeing a couple of episodes from this sitcom, I ended hating everything about it.For me, the biggest problem from The Big Bang Theory (Besides of the unfunny jokes and the awful cultural references) were the characters. All of them were incredibly unlikeable and annoying (even those that the viewers are supposed to sympathize) unsurprisingly, those characters are also clichÃ©s, perpetuating the stereotypical characterization of the nerd archetype as seen in many, many other movies and television shows, since the film Revenge of the Nerds.All the references made in this show are not only bland, shallow and forced, but also painfully unfunny as well. To get things worse, that stupid laugh track made all those so-called jokes even more irritating, as it were constant reminders to the viewers of what they are supposed to be laughing at.I consider The Big Bang Theory  to be a strongly mediocre series with overused stereotypes and flat jokes. For me, this show was like the live-action equivalent of one those lame and unfunny gaming web comics which try to be cool and edgy by including misogyny and lots of random (and also utterly pointless) nerd references.So, in other words, The Big Bang Theory is the (stereotypically) nerd version of Friends.'"
"When The Big Bang Theory premiered three years ago, I was certainly skeptical since it came from the creators of Two and A Half-Men (one of the worst comedies on TV ever). However, since then, it has proved to be one of the best comedies on Television.The ensemble cast is amazing, quite amazing in every way. Johnny Galecki is a true comedy lead star, and Kaley Cuoco has gotten better since her 8 Simple Rules days. However, as great as the cast is, the shining star here is Jim Parsons. He has created one of the funniest, most obscure and interesting characters I have ever seen in a sitcom, thanks in large part to the writing and to his magnificent portrayal. It is evident that he holds the show together.Overall, this is a very likable comedy series, that while it started off so-so, has gotten better and better and has proved it's greatness over the years."
"Having watched all the seasons, here's my final review of the show:\nHad to change my rating from 10 to 8, because I've rated this one with 10 back when the show had three seasons and the final ones were really disappointing. So, sometimes, you had to keep watching because you loved the characters and the series had grown on you.\nOverall, the show is one of the best comedies out there and a classic for sure. The first seasons were pure gold, funny, fresh and entertaining. The last ones slowed things down and focused more on the characters stories, although they were funny too.\nFinal thoughts: A must see, as it doesn't stray from the original idea, even if the characters changed overtime."
"How the hell does this show gets an 8.6 rating on IMDb? Am i completely missing the point or what? Without bragging about myself I'm normally known by my friends to have a great sense of humor but this series is just so dumb with almost nothing humorous in it. The characters are so lame and they are actually not even good actors. Almost every character in this series is annoying. You kind of feel the urge to slap them in the face after every line they speak. And the most horrible part of the show is the laugh track. After every single phrase they speak you are apparently obliged to laugh. Well I only laugh or smile when it's funny, I never do on command. And in this show I hardly never laugh because it's just not funny at all. This show is an insult to other comedies."
"'It is easy to praise the father-daughter relationship that Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) display in this dark and compelling film, but I feel that would be superficial.The relationship appeared to be much deeper - almost sexual - as the two tried to find some meaning in their lives.Leon was just slouching through life doing his job and not caring about much else. A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda. Reno and Portman were brilliant and aptly supported by Oldman and Danny Aiello.'"
"'HBO\'s The Wire, another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered Homicide: Life on the Street, raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, The Wire is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far. (A)'"
"I have seen many brilliant shows, and The Wire is one of them. Even the word brilliant isn't enough to put into words how good this series is. The Wire is incredibly well made, with moody lighting, striking location work that also brings atmosphere and great photography, while the music is very haunting. The Wire with its thoughtful and tense dialogue also has some of the best writing of any show I've seen, the stories are ceaselessly compelling and the characters are rich and unforgettable. All the episodes are superbly directed, and very rarely do you feel cheated at the end of episodes. The acting is superb, Dominic West and Idris Elba are especially brilliant. In conclusion, phenomenal. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"I remember watching the American movie of Doctor Who years earlier but thats about it.For those who have no idea who the Doctor is; let me just say he has become a part of British culture, just like Bond.I didn't pay attention to the first series with Eccelston but during the second season I watched the episode 'Tooth and Claw' it had a dark and grim mood. Then the episode 'The girl in the fire place' was very dark and scary; it really shows how much a good script can do. The show has some great episodes and good villains; Tennant does the role justice even though he seems at times, over-acting...But as the series goes on it seems that Russel.T.Davies is trying to make the show into something like 'Buffy'; which I happen to be a very big fan of...and Davies fails.And it seems that bits of the show are pieces of Hollywood movies...Overall this is a good show but is let down by some of the plots; and acting."
This show is decent but not necessarily great or thrilling. It's good for what it is - entertaining science fiction that will keep you hooked.
"One of my favorite shows is on the air since 1963, more than half of a century. I followed it till December 2015 when they decided to skip 2016. I turned to some other shows and forgot about it. Season 2017 is over and in a month season 2018 begins. So last night I got back to it and reminded myself why I love it so much. In meantime I started original series and saw first two out of 26 seasons. It is good, but it's not quite it. Since 2005 Doctor Who becomes one of the best series ever. I will see all of it sooner or later, but only when I'm done with new seasons. To TV series fanatics with lots of spare time I warmly recommend all 37 seasons, but this last 11 seasons are must watch for every TV series fan.10/10"
"5 December 2011. It's rare to continue discovering strange new worlds and new life in a television series, yet Dr. Who retooled and redesigned with a new team of scriptwriters has managed to break into new thresholds of emotive and imaginative speculation in a nice balance of humor and drama. Building on the revived seasons before it, by the time Season is wrapped up the energy, the substantive quality and richness of the scripts are amazingly progressively involving and captivating, a rarity among television series. Among the movie classics of A Wrinkle in Time (2002), The Truman Show (1998), Being John Malkovich (2000), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Slaughter-House Five (1972), Silent Hill (2006), Super 8 (2011),even Wall*e (2008), and Spirited Away (2001), and television classics of X-Files, Fringe, Heros, Charmed, and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer. Even so, the last two television series even though based on magic - resonated even more directly with life in the contemporary world and The Lost Room (2006 TV) and Defying Gravity (2009 TV) were focused compelling sci fi drama, whereas Dr. Who seems to spiral its audience into fantasy of far away places even as it sometimes deals with our world at home, albeit United Kingdom, mostly."
"'After hearing the departure of Matt Smith, as there will be somebody that will play yet another witty doctor. As Doctor Who is as old as any of us can count.Show has wit, charm, and knows when to be serious and when to be funny. Anybody who plays the doctor, knows that you have to have humor, be a great actor, and really know the emotions of the character.I grew up with the Tom Baker episodes. And kind of had a crush on him with those curls and offering jelly beans. When I lived as a kid in Fla. But still, no matter who plays the doctor, it will keep on continuing.Hats off to the longest ever BBC show in their history. Keep on doing what you are doing.'"
"Those who've given this bad reviews are constantly claiming it's trying to be Game of Thrones. It's not. It is a dark fantasy, but the magic is consistent as is, for the first season, the storytelling. It's its own world and it's a good one. I never knew about the Witcher until I saw the trailers and then buzzed through the season. Not a bad performance and Yennefer and Geralt are the primary characters. Henry Cavil shows his acting chops and the rest of the cast is really well done. There is one dragon, and it's nothing like the beasts from GOT. This dragon is more like a cousin of Smaug, and the more classical dragons. Well worth watching."
"The WitcherI loved it!In many way this series was a bit of a mess, the box set skipped around, half the time we had no clue what this or that meant, and the whole thing lacked cohesiveness, whether this was entirely intentional I would think not. However by the end of the series we were less confused and there were some elements that created better connection. In summation this was not easy viewing.Whoever did the casting was inspired, we had in the main seasoned pros, this well upped the whole series. Henry Cavill was perfect for the role and a master of the aside, the deadpan humour and a good deal of comic timing.There were so many good things here we were spoilt, it does need to raise itself before it becomes mired in teenage angst or to many special effects, it is the strength of story and dramatic impetus that will make this show stand out.If someone is truly evil make them so no half measures.I just can't wait for series 2, I want it now......!"
"When you're blessed with that kind of alluring beauty, you had better back it up with the talent as you put yourself out there. Without the audience's unquestionable addiction to her, this show (now going into a seventh season) is but a minor footnote in the crime drama genre. A lot of money is being spent in this production, but had they taken away the girl's designer clothes and hair and makeup artists, and had just given her a better script to work with.. her real talent would have the opportunity to shine through, and it might have had an increased chance at being a truly worthwhile series. Going through what will be 150 episodes plus is a lot for even the best of productions to withstand... praise the heavens in this instance for fast-forward streaming. PS.. so after eight seasons it falters to such a hurried uneventful demise... just as numerous real-life marriages do as well. Many felt it should have been given the hook long before. Will be interesting to see how-where they all rise from the ashes."
"There are two distinctly different versions of this Film. The theatrical American release called The Professional and the International and Home Video cut titled Leon: The Professional or just Leon. The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer. It is an uncompromising and unconventional uncovering of some uncomfortable realities that are challenging as well as engaging. It is a Movie that can isolate many but also endear those willing to take on a bit more than usual."
"I have liked this series from the beginning. I do have some gripes however. Why don't the characters call each other by their first names overall? Even after they get married Beckett and Castle call each other by their last names. I see this on other series. It is very annoying. They have been working together a long time. Enough already. Also, if you have attractive women let them dress to show off their looks. Stana Katic and Tamala Jones are very attractive, let them show it. This happens too infrequently. I think the mix of comedy and mystery is just right. Leave it as is. The other annoying point is Susan Sullivan's accent. It is extremely annoying. It is like closing my eyes and hearing Katherine Hepburn. I found her accent annoying even in short sentences. I remember her in a perry mason movies in the '80's or '90's. She did not have the accent then. Get rid of it. I like the series regardless of my gripes."
"This show, perhaps my favorite, is a good blend of drama, comedy, wholesomeness, and romance. Castle, on the show, is a very prolific writer. (Maybe Fillon is too.) At the same time, he is a good father with that daughter of his. (Molly O'Quinn does a very good turn in the series.) And, of course, Susan Sullivan is a very appealing icon. Not only is Castle a good writer, but what would the NYPD do without him? Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic, is an unusually attractive lady very conscientious about her job. The plots of each episode keep the viewer wondering until almost the very last second: as a rule, you won't know the identity of the criminal till then. The comedy comes about when Castle and Beckett conduct persiflage with each other. Sometimes the jokes may be groaners, but you never tire from hearing them. What has always struck my attention...and this is nothing astounding...is whether or not they would ever have a lasting romance. I did like the last episode of the past season. A wonderful series. May it last forever."
I would not be surprised if a survey of the regular watchers revealed that the guys watched it just for Stana Katic & the girls watched it just for Nathan Fillion.They were running a repeat of the first 6 seasons around these parts and I used to watch it every night at dinner time.They first season was good but then it started going downhill pretty fast. A back-story about Kate's mother that became more and more atrocious as the show dragged on. Saving the whole of New York simply by yanking all the wires on a massive bomb.......the list of stupidity is endless.The suspense in every show is the joke part. It would take a 12 year old around 5 minutes to predict who would be the culprit with 90% accuracy.This show must be right up there alongside Jersey Shore and Keeping up with the Kardashians.Terrible show aimed at people with limited thinking ability.Its amazing that it is still on. I would have thought that the studios would have pulled the plug a long long time ago.Everyone who has ever seen the show is a lesser human being for having seen this show.
"'Black Mirror is a trip to the what if realm......Unlike its title, the stories presented are not always dark and dystopian. Its a mixed bag, of cautionary, horror but also at times, genuinely uplifting and even moving, tales from the other side. The standard of storytelling, predictably, varies. Sometimes there is real flair and inspiration on offer. Other times, the tales can be rather unremarkable and occasionally, boring. That said, as a guide, I\'d say this series is more polished than not. Season three, sees a departure from UK only based episodes and offers up imaginings from the US as well. Its a good move, that works well, breaking up the UK centric feel of the show. I like Dark Mirror and hope for more in future. Seven out of ten from me.'"
"Charlie Brooker is a great satirist: funny and clever, and, although often crude, in 'Black Mirror' he certainly isn't pandering to the lowest common denominator (in spite of the fact that the first film is about the prime minister having sex with a pig!). Indeed, he (and his collaborators) show themselves to be skilled film-makers: in this trio of short stories about how technology is changing our lives, two have a sci-fi feels and the understated way with which a future world, subtly different to our own, is conveyed, with a minimum of carefully deployed special effects, is a lesson to Hollywood with its obsession with spectacle and its inability to understand that less can be more. Yet while Brooker's films are delicately made, there's a certain obviousness to the points he is making; while he's extraordinarily skillful in imagining the details, there's less below the surface than you might hope for. I found the middle film the most convincing (and indeed moving), and exactly because it was most explicitly a fable; in the others, Brooker's merciless eye is also not a little heartless. But Brooker deserves credit for not standing still, and settling for making new series of 'Screenburn' ad infinitum; 'Black Mirror' may only be a partial success, but it's bold and fresh and worth watching, even if it's not so much deeper than the world it's taking apart."
"'The hype is real. \nI just finished all seasons (as of the date of this review seasons one to four). This show is great but far from amazing thanks to some oddball episodes that fall flat. The Christmas episode was outstanding and so was the one about the rating system. Templates for the future of mankind thanks to the evil corporations and satanic demons running Hollywood? Probably. Yeah, most of the world are all doomed because they are foolish enough not to see the warning signs. Meh, my work here is done and this review is over.'"
"It's one of the best series I've ever watched. There were excellent episodes, there were also good episodes. Sometimes it's bad :)"
"The series is generally beautiful, with all episodes disconnected you can watch what you want a little while skipping the episodes you don't like. In most of the series the tension is very high and the episodes are brilliant. There is some flaw that compromises the series a little but in general it is really nice."
"One of those shows that was massively hyped when it started and now seems to exist quietly in the background, loved by only a few.For me it lacks total historical accuracy, the people playing the key figures never look anything like them, and it's all a bit soap opera-esque."
"'Would you like to watch a series with tremendously good writing, acting and filming with the magical direction and production of Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, then Better Call Saul is the right show for you, after the legendary Breaking Bad.The screenplay is awesomeThe direction is nearly breathtakingThe acting is 99% flawless with shiny starsThe vibe of the show has the power of a 600 horsepower carAnd the filming with accentuation on small details, a real real pleasure to watchOne and only, made by the wizard that Vince Gilligan is.'"
"'Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by LÃ©on Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. LÃ©on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protÃ©gÃ©e and learns the assassin\'s trade.This is what you get if you take Lolita (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exerciseâa slick urban thrillerâit seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it. Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman\'s rising star.'"
"'You know that feel when one foot fell asleep and you try to bring it back to life? That\'s what happened to my brain every time I tried to endure an episode of The Handmaid\'s Tale while figuring out why this show gets so much approval. Diagnosis: one of those shows or movies who are praised for their message only - the quality of the other parameters (story, production, directing, acting and so on) are then a completely irrelevant matter, because you know, the message is important ;)'"
"The show starts with a crashed jet on a deserted island. The survivors find the island is not so deserted and one of many mystery. On its surface, it is simply a scripted version of Survivor, the popular TV reality show. But as it develops, it shows itself to be much much more. The vast and varied cast is led by TV veteran Matthew Fox. They form a great family group of many individual skills. Their chemistry is truly compelling.This is J.J. Abrams' best creation of all of his many projects. The pilot is terrific and I love the first season as we follow the various characters. I don't want to give any spoilers. This is must-see TV."
"Since the dawn of television, serialized series have been quite popular with audiences. It peaked when JR was shot nearly 40 years ago and has survived VHS, cable, and streaming and video games. 24 made it real innovative with its real time episodes set in an hour (with commercials). Then in 2004, ABC kicked off its hit season with Desperate Housewives and Lost. Created by the same guy who made Jennifer Garner a sex icon in Alias, Lost is about a crew of plane passengers that crash into an island trying to find their way home. LIke seinfeld, the series finale is not as good as other finales but concludes the most confusing tv storyline ever made. I remember watching part of the two hour season premiere which at the time was the most expensive TV pilot ever made until Game of Thrones broke that record. I had a crush on Evangeline Lilly before she became the wasp as well as other movie roles and the way it was shot and sounded like felt like a movie. Even the title is very twilight zoneish. It's available to watch for free on IMDB TV as well as on Hulu, so watch all seven seasons if you dare."
"Lost is somewhat difficult to review as a whole, episode quality varied somewhat, from the incredible opening episode, to the divisive finale. You could argue the show went on for too long, that the broadcaster milked it a little, but for me the show is at its strongest about half way through, series three sees the mystery and suspense cranked up, more questions asked and some good new characters. The final series is a little disappointing, I personally didn't like the conclusion, but I'm sure many fans do.Lost highlights the importance and art of storytelling, as a viewer you are tricked, confused and pushed into many blind alleys, trouble is when you start watching you can't switch off, it's always so engaging. The puzzles unravel slowly.Very well acted all round, I especially liked Matthew Fox and Michael Emerson, Ben is such an interesting character, he adds a lot to the series.I will always be a big fan of Lost, somehow it feels like a game changer."
"Outlander has been around from 2014 and has year by year become a firmly focused story, which in season 3, episode 8, has now reached a new pinnacle.Never having read any of the books, the theme was unknown to me and certainly has grown in esteem over the years. It took us from the late 1940's to the Scottish highlands in the past, with infighting, disputes, intrigue and outright war. The characters are well developed and play their roles perfectly. In this new phase, 20 story-years later, it is transforming into a powerful, compassionate and personal tale with revelations of those missing 20 years, leaving a posing conundrum. It raises the status of this series exponentially and compels me to increase my rating from 8 to 9!"
"The second season of Outlander ended with an epic finale that explored the time travel nature and concluded Claire Randall (Caitriona Balfe) first jaunt back in time. This season explored new annals of history traveling to Paris then back to Scotland and jumping back and forth through time. There was a bit of a slow down when Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan) and Claire first returned to Scotland. In Paris, Jamie and Claire sought to prevent the slaughter at Culloden Moor by ending the Jacobite rebellion at the source, the bonny Prince Charlie (Andrew Gower). This season delved into the gritty maneuverings of the monarchy through the brothels of Paris. There Jamie encounters the young boy pickpocket Fergus (Romann Berrux) while Claire's pronunciation of smallpox on a shipment of wine makes an enemy of Comte St. Germain (Stanley Weber).Their negotiations and bribes are not enough to stop the tide of history and Jamie mortal enemy Black Jack Randall (Tobias Menzies), the ancestor of Claire's present day husband Frank, shows up in Paris to see to his cousin and generally cause trouble for Jamie who immediately challenges him to a duel though Claire knows that if he dies, then Frank will never exist.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

"Season 1 - Oh I really enjoyed the first season. Not exactly top notch as some other Starz series have been but pretty close. Ron Moore of course gave us great quality with BSG back in the 2000's and his delivery on this series is almost as good. Season 1 to me really was all about Tobias Menzies performance. Haha, I loved his dual role as Frank and more importantly Captain 'Black Jack' Randall. Episodes 6 and I think 16 stood out with a couple of the greatest scenes ever. Captain Randall's conversation with Claire in Ep6 and his 'encounter' with Jaime in Ep. 16 were both totally intense. Some really great TV offered here. Season 1 gets a 9/10 from me.Season 2 - Not as impressed with the 1st half of Season 2 Wasn't impressed at all about how Highlander Jaime and Sassanach Beauchamp arrive in France and suddenly become 'all that'. I mean come on now. Everything just falls into place and they are suddenly hobnobbing with royalty??? Yeah that was lame. LAME I say!!! But the 2nd half of season 2 was some good stuff. Back in the Homeland and back with Colum, and Dougal, Angue and Rupert. That's what I really wanted to see. And the Season Finale, that was intense. Almost perfect season finale. Season 2 gets a 7/10"
"Let's face it, the Simpsons popularity has grown over the last twenty years ever since it made it's debut on the Tracey Ullman Show. Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson. Being an animated show has it's advantages though, gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices. The show works because of the powers behind the show's success. Maggie is still a baby, Bart is still a brat, and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart. The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself. In live sitcoms, the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another. There are episodes that are good and plentiful. They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe. I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more. They'll be happy to comply."
"I just love this show there's absolutely nothing to hate about it there's very smart jokes,memorable episodes and such fantastic characters,and the amazing thing is its considered one of the best T.V. shows in history and its a cartoon and its also been around for more than 20 years,this show is easily the greatest show ever made theirs classical characters such as Homer,Bart,Marge,Lisa,Maggie,Apu,Grampa,D.R. Hibbert,Groundskeeper Willie,Principal Skinner,Otto,Sideshow Bob,Chief Wiggum,Santas Little Helper,Ned Flanders,Nelson,Moe,M.R. Burns,Milhouse,Smithers,Barney and Krusty and it also has gotten more than 400 episodes and with all the things that can happen around Springfield and a tree house of horror every season it will never run out of ideas,the Simpsons is without a doubt my favourite show and I give it a deserved 10/10."
"'Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a well spoken bounty hunter who acquires Django (Jamie Foxx) to find and kill some men who are wanted, dead or alive. Dr. Schultz isn\'t too keen on the live part.The film divides itself into two parts. After the bounty hunting episodes are through, our duo conceive a plan to rescue the wife of Django (Kerry Washington) by purchasing her from Candie Land plantation. Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn\'t enter the film until the second part.Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in Blazing Saddles. The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would of had a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.Tarantino fans will not be disappointed. Great sound track.Parental Guidance: F-bomb,N-word, nudity (Kerry Washington). No sex. Killing and slow motion blood splatter.'"
"Kowabunga!! The characters are all classics on this show. What this show does so well when you watch it a lot is defines it's characters sharply & throw in so much comedy that the throw away lines are even great. When you watch this enough & think Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, Moe, Crusty the Clown, Montgomery Burns, & Abu (among others), you get a mental picture of the character & sometimes see people in your real life who resemble them. Some of the resemblance is deliberate when you consider Matt Gronig's mind. Some of it is happen stance.Regardless, the show will always have its critics because it does shoot from the hip & hit raw nerves about almost any subject. In truth, it is that edge that makes it great. It takes any topic & lampoons it. It recreates great scenes from past TV & movies & lampoons them. Nothing is sacred on the Simpons. That's Funny!!!"
"'A modern day \'Flintstones\'.  This show is already a classic, and it is still running.  The writers are having a hard time finding new material, but keeps fresh with modern day social humor.  Homer can be a little too much at times.  The show pushes against Political correctness to the limit.  The only weak character is the Doctor, I know it is a poke at the cosby show but hey that show has been off the air for over 11 year and a lot of viewers miss that punch line.  It\'s getting too old.  My favorite episode is the time travel one with Homer.  Only problem, with the show\'s popularity, is the over play of reruns.  I am starting to become sick of the over played episodes, and it will become another MASH.  MASH used to be shown 7 days a week like the the Simpsons.  It is too bad, we had to wait for 4 years for it to come to Canada. You see a lot of Conan O\'Brien humor in both shows.'"
"This cartoon series has everything you'd want - memorable characters, funny gags and insightful stories. Each episode is like a window into American society and it shows so much about different areas of our lives. The characters themselves are so fleshed out that it's like we know then personally, which leads to some very personal and emotional moments at times."
"'CSI takes the viewer into the world of forensic criminal investigations set against the glitz and glitter of the Las Vegas strip. Mr. Vanilla (Petersen) leads the Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) unit comprised of a bunch of actors who look like a bunch of actors while playing it fast and loose with the forensic sciences. Tight, fast moving, and formulaic, CSI solves cases like an Energizer bunny on Speed with no room for character development, emotional investments, back stories, buy-ins, and drama. The result is a hugely popular fare of fast food for small screen freaks which will play best with less sophisticated and discerning TV viewers. More sophisticated audiences might want to check out Homicide:Life in the Streets, Prime Suspect, Cracker and the like  to satisfy their more jaded palates. (B-)'"
"I love these kinds of shows, so I came across CSI:Crime Scene Inestigation by accident while flicking through channels, and since that moment I have been hooked. I like how each crime is looked at from a different perspective, it offers a whole new slant on things, although some of the more disturbing/graphic images may turn your stomach a little. Also, I love the colours the series is shot in, reds, blues, greens and yellow, really a treat to the eye, and the photography is very impressive. And the music is funky and cool, well the theme song is from The Who, they ooze with coolness. I like the writing, Grissom's dialogue and asides are a joy to behold especially, and the methodical but well structured story lines. The season finales nearly always manage to be gripping and compelling. And the acting is great, William Peterson was wonderful as Grissom, and although I was sad to see him go, the character's departure was handled very well so I was glad of that. The reason why it isn't quite as good as it could have been is because somehow I don't find it as well thought out as the earlier seasons. And while Laurence Fishburne is a great actor and does a good job, I kind of miss Grissom if you get the jist. That said though, this is a great show. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"'CSI was suppose to be the backup with a remake of the Fugitive originally. But now, thirteen years later, guess which show made it? As the show shows what it is like to see the overlooked forensics and crime experts that work in the background while the police are at the front.The original show set in Las Vegas proves what happens in Vegas does not always stay that way. Like Law & Order, the show has seen it\'s fair of cast changes.But still the show does it\'s best to not run out of story lines. And to see where the evidence is. And who really is the culprit. As the evidence lies with them.An original show that has now NY and the now canceled Miami!'"
"It's the funniest tv show I've ever seen by a long shot, I've watched it all the way through 3 times and it still makes me laugh out loud. I quote this all time with all my mates and family."
"While being one of the funniest shows on television, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not afraid to address complicated social issues in enlightening ways. From addressing racial discrimination to poverty, the gang always find some strange way to explore difficult situations in a hilarious way. Season 12 saw the gang actually try to tend bar at the behest of Dennis (Glenn Howerton) and Mac (Rob McElhenney) finally come out of the closet just to receive the winnings of a lottery ticket after a long litigation that cost the price of the ticket. Charlie (Charlie Day) got jealous of a tapeworm and finally impregnated the waitress (Mary Elizabeth Ellis). Frank (Danny DeVito) had trouble with his fluid business and Dee (Kaitlin Olson) became obsessed with destroying the life of a male stripper.The gang never fail to go over the top with their outlandish and idiotic schemes that from filming Mac and Charlie's parents and turning it into a sitcom to trying their hand at public relations. Cricket (David Hornsby) got an episode where his father tries to pull out of poverty, though his descent due to Dee is too far to ever come back from. Dee enacted the same sort of vengeance on a stripper even though her attempt to prove that she wasn't his lowest point lead to a disturbing encounter. Dee is continuously bullied by the gang and ignored.Check out more of this review and others at swiliky.com"

"It's always sunny in Philadelphia is one of the best shows on television. A lot of the shows on TV are good. But there are some that are bad. This show is far from it. It's so crazy and insanely funny... I can't describe it to you. There are many likable characters on the show. My favorite is played by an Olsen sister. An Olsen sister who nobody knows about. They should know about her, because she's great. Also, Danny Devito's character is very funny.The show is actually pretty insane at many times. There are people getting stabbed, in The Christmas special, I think one of the characters bites someone. It's crazy. My favorite show on television is Curb your enthusiasm with Larry David, and that show is rated R too. Those shows are better. The R rated ones. This is one of them. and this is one of the better shows on television today."
"Overly violent and constant use of the derogatory term for African-Americans marks this 2012 Quentin Tarrantino film.Christoph Waltz won the best supporting actor award despite the fact that he is in every scene, with the exception of the last 20 minutes of the film. As the house slave totally devoted to his master, a mean, fierce Leonardo De Caprio, Samuel L. Jackson should have been in the supporting category instead.A study of how a bounty hunter gets a slave free to pursue his own agenda of catching three brothers. The brothers are known by slave Jamie Foxx. Foxx is taught how to shoot and conduct himself as a man by Waltz, a German dentist turned bounty hunter. Waltz is high on intelligence and especially uses an effective vocabulary.The two conspire to free Foxx's enslaved wife, who has been separated from him and is under the De Caprio terror.A study of ante-bellum south with their bigotry."
"'Knives Out reminded me of Gosford Park, with its focus on an obnoxious rich family amid a murder. In both cases, there are things that we find out about the family. In this case, Rian Johnson\'s Oscar-nominated screenplay really lets the characters unleash their most wanton statements. Like the miniseries The Politician, it shows what people end up doing when they have unlimited wealth.Definitely see it. You\'re in for some real surprises.'"
"After watching the pilot I got really excited with Mr.Robot. It was very promising. I really liked the idea of the anarchist trying to mess up the financial world. Rami Malek seemed to be the perfect actor for that role. But the pilot might have been promising, the rest of the season went downwards very quickly. I don't know what the script writers were thinking but to me they are going completely the wrong way. And that's too bad because I really had big hopes for this show. The actors are not bad at all though, it's just the storyline that isn't good enough. They should more focus on the real hacking and anarchy then the mental issues of Elliot Alderson. That was a real bummer to me. I was going to give it a nine after the pilot but now after finishing the first season it only deserves maximum a five star rating. Hopefully they will do much better in the second season otherwise this series is going to die a slow death."
'It was perfect.It was great.It was great.It was engrossing.It was legendary.'
"Everything having to do with going against society and conspiracies I crave! Mr. Robot is incredibly filmed, written, and has such an exciting soundtrack! I absolutely love the vibes I get from all the excellent things that happen throughout. Some of the best suspense ever and profound quotes/speeches. Rami Malek has become one of my favorite actors to watch and I have enjoyed Christian Slater quite a lot. I can't wait till I can own season 4 like I own the other seasons."
"'Great show with a great cast. If you like unusual crime/thriller shows like Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Bridge and a few others, Ozark is made for you. In times of fast produced mass products that flood all channels, Ozark is a real gem and top of the pops.'"
"After watching the first episode of Ozark I wasn't that excited about watching a second. I only did so because my girlfriend wanted to. But that next episode was much better, and I had a lot of hope for the series.But at the end of season 1 I'm still a little lukewarm to it all.The good is very good. Marty Byrde is a fascinating character, and I love those moments where he talks himself out of an impossible situation; it's interesting to see a crime show where the protagonist never results to violence. Ruth is a terrific character as well. The plotting is elaborate and fairly convincing.But I find my interesting waxing and waning throughout each episode. And in general I'm not big on shows where characters hop from one disaster to the next; it's exhausting."
"'/refers to Season 1/Recent years I have somehow moved away from US drama/crime series as I have found the UK and Scandinavian ones catchier. But thanks to some references and promotion materials (incl. IMDB) I have run into series like Ozark - with distinct characters and performances, solutions without external intervention, events developing in narrow areas, thrill mixed with personal intertwinings, etc. Well, one can always question the plausibility of depicted crimes in a democratic society, but if well explained and expressed, then you follow the course of events without wtf! and blah! feelings. And if complemented by beautiful environment, pleasant performances (Bateman was a surprise, usually I am not too fond of the movies he participates) and the scenes with twists where do you not know how to react as comic and tragic are intertwined.All in all, I am looking forward to Season 2 already.'"
"'Season 1: 3/10 (2 viewings, 2/15/2021)\nI watched this when it first came out but didn\'t like it enough to keep going past season 1. All my friends keep talking about how awesome it is, so i decided to watch it all. Going thru season 1 again was basically unbearable and very difficult to get thru. It is jam-packed with the worst part about all anime. The long extensive scenes of talking to yourself and questioning things. why am i doing this? They\'re all counting on me and i am just going to let them down? What kind of a person would just watch when they could do something about it? Why would they give us these orders? Should i just follow them blindly? Should i stop asking questions and do something????? i wanted to yell SHUT UP ALREADY numerous times. As many as 5 episodes pass with 1 or 2 plot points combined. UnacceptableSeason 2: 4 stars (1 viewing, 2/19/2021)\nSeason 3: 3 stars (1 viewing, 3/9/2021)'"
"Any civilization that can construct such gigantic walls, hundreds of miles long, surely possesses the technology to wipe out the titans; unless I missed it, this is never explained. The graphics are striking, especially the action sequences, and you never quite get used to the titans' facial expressions; they look like bored people waiting for a bus, which is all the more discomforting when they casually pop a human being in their mouth. About that FF button: there are long, long sequences of character development dialogue that could have been shortened considerably in order to tighten the storyline; sometimes this development goes on for several episodes in a row. The classic escalating argument/arrive at a conclusion storytelling armature is rather stretched to its practical limits, and repeats itself many times during the course of the show, long after your patience is exhausted. The entire female titan story arc is rather thrilling and suspenseful, and the payoff is worth the investment of time. Eren can't speak without screaming, so I had to turn my volume way down whenever his face pops up. The whole 3d maneuvering device thing was pretty cool. Overall I loved this series, well what I've seen of it so far, and I'll continue watching."
"This show Archer is hilarious I love the relationship between the characters. It seems they are all dysfunctional people that can't stop having sex with each other. I also, love the sexist, racist and stupid jokes. I love the episode of the ocelot and Archer on the train and he yells at the ocelot. I love the fact that Katya and Archer kept falling in love. And I love the whole crazy Barry skits! This show is also hilarious with Aisha Tyler voicing Lana Kane always has me laughing at the fake hatred for Archer and how its actually her trying to hide her emotions that she is in love with Archer and the same thing happens with Archer to Lana."
"'The earlier seasons are better than the last seasons where they change the era, but they were OK. Overall the fun is when Archer makes himself look like an idiot.'"
"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, his sister, and her husband. We were all enthralled watching this drama-thriller about a man whose wife had disappeared and the revelations about them both. Ben Affleck is the star with nice supporting turns by Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry (yes, the guy who's usually known as Medea!), Carrie Coon, Casey Wilson, and many others. However, the most compelling performance is from Rosamond Pike. I remember liking her as a Bond girl in Die Another Day but here, she's really on fire if you know what I mean! All I'll say now is you may or not be surprised by the twists and turns that happen in this film but you won't be bored, that's for sure! David Fincher has done it again! So on that note, I highly recommend Gone Girl."
"'The earlier seasons are better than the last seasons where they change the era, but they were OK. Overall the fun is when Archer makes himself look like an idiot.'"
"Archer is James Bond in sitcom form. Unlike Bond, Archer's mother is the head of the secret service agency he works for. And this mother and son couple do not get along at all. They find joy in the other's humiliation and/or pain. This show is incredibly entertaining, and while the animation is impressive in detail it feels weird to watch at times because it doesn't have the same 'flow' as cel-animation. That's probably because it's done on Adobe After Effects and/or Flash.Spy fiction is a creative pool writers can screw around with endlessly: they can dig into the many clichÃ©s of James Bond films, The Bourne Films, and just being all-round nostalgic for films of the 60s. It's like if Ian Fleming teamed up with Mel Brooks, Trey Parker and Matt Groening.Very good stuff, and guarantees your full attention and enjoyment."
"I honesty don't understand how this show doesn't get as much buzz as some of the other adult cartoons out there. This amazing show is smart, cynical, funny, perfectly voiced and suitably animated (the only reason that I took off a star form a perfect rating, though with time you absolutely get used to the style of animation).\nIt has almost perfect character development throughout the series without too much drama. Captivating characters that in my opinion so much better than all other similar cartoons. Absolutely amazing re-watch value (I watched all the seasons up to date at least several times). This show did get a cult following and I'm really happy that it got renewed (hopefully for many more seasons), but it should be definitely have much more buzz.Keep on creating!"
"One of the more original and funny sitcoms I've been watching. After all, if it was bad it would not last for almost a decade. I've heard they spoiled it near the end, but after five seasons I have absolutely no objections.8/10"
"This show started not to long after Friends ended but I thought i was a perfect re-placement for Friends. I not lot fan don't like me Comparing both shows, both are set in new york and their daily love lives. I loved first 3 season, I thought every episode had in laughing and loud for 30 mins each week! Those series really well done as pace was really good in those series and there not many filler episode (This current season) After season 3, I think that when really start to lose it's charm , it did have some good decent and now again, I which really enjoyed. The next few season were a really mixed bag and this latest series is to me as been really bad, I have worst series yet, I don't think there was on decent episode I liked this year! I hoping this is the last season but those Kids on those couch have their own kids! 6 out of 10"
"Don't get me wrong, I do love sitcoms. I love Frasier, I love Friends, I love Cheers, I love Black Adder, I love Last of the Summer Wine(mostly) and I love Fawlty Towers. But I just can't get into How I Met your Mother. At first it was alright, there were some good ideas, some of the situations were at least fun. But as the show has progressed, in my personal opinion it is running out of ideas and it feels more dull and laboured by the minute. I do like the production values, and there is one good character Barney, wonderfully played by Neil Patrick Harris. The other characters I don't care for, in general I find them stupid and unlikeable, while the writing and jokes are forced and predictable now that the show lacks a good pace and freshness and some of the situations are not at all funny, more inane if anything. The acting also feels forced and over-compensated, as if the actors know their characters and writing are lacking and they're trying to make it work. Harris in my opinion is the one exception who doesn't suffer, that's because he's that good an actor, he has had some bad material but he always gives his all to elevate it. All in all, I do like sitcoms and comedies when they're good, but How I Met Your Mother is an example of one I can't get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
"'One of my friends told me to watch this show and I think I managed to watch like a season before stopping. Its ok, I guess, but overall I found it boring and the characters annoying. I asked the friend why she liked it and she answered all the sex scenes so I guess that\'\'s why people are watching it.'"
"'OK, I admit. I am not particularly open to shows or movies, which have a major loser as the lead role. William H. Macy, as good as he is, is difficult to watch, in this train wreck of a character. I gave up after only two episodes.The rest of the cast is very good. The closest Shameless comes to nobility is oldest daughter Fiona, beautifully played by Emmy Rossum, who single-handedly gives the show a reason for being and viewers a possible reason for returning. Fiona is afraid to hope for more than she has, yet may have found it in a nice man who comes to her rescue at a bar. He is well played too.The family dysfunction is entertaining. And so is Emmy Rossum, in addition to being very easy to look at and watch! But, the lead character was so lacking in redeeming characteristics, and such a boring schmo, I just could not take it anymore.'"
"Gobsmacked at the news that this show has been cancelled after only three seasons!Currently, if a series doesn't have social messages central to every plot, they won't be supported, and abandoned.With imbecilic agenda shows like Arrow/Flash/Legends/Supergirl continuing to survive in an era where the wrong people are making these propaganda decisions, it's obvious that there won't be much chance for another high caliber show as this one to make an appearance any time soon.***For fans of The Expanse, fortunately, there's an option. There are a stack of books available to continue the saga! (Unfortunately, it will upset you even more when you see how awesome future seasons of this series was going to be, once you read where the incredible story was taking us!)\nThey are all also in audible book form. No CGI can duplicate your imagination."
"Not a bad show. There are highs and lows. Decent writing. Decent directing. Some scenes are outstanding. Suspense and originality make a for a good combination. Character progression is smooth and stable, but there are sometimes when I get bored and want to skip forward. Cool cinematography, special effects and an effort to make things realistic add to the quality of the production. It's not perfect. It has flaws which are obvious. However all the good things I like about the show carry it forward. I like the mix of the politics and multiple story arcs. It also has great season finales because they are cliff hangers, leaving you wanting more."
"'Gone Girl is so smoothly-filmed and staged and acted, a less-seasoned moviegoer is apt to come away from the picture with nothing but admiration and praise. An upscale married couple in New York City hits a financial bump and ends up living with the husband\'s family in Missouri (in an equally beautiful home, by the way). After a few years, with the relatives now deceased, the couple\'s marriage unravels and, before long, the wife turns up missing (their glass table is shattered and police find a mopped-up bloodbath in the kitchen). Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in Gone Girl to engage our interest except for Fincher\'s jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****'"
"Outstanding dialog, score, acting and story lineCreators: Lisa Joy, Jonathan NolanStars: Evan Rachel Wood( Dolores Abernathy), Thandie Newton ( Maeve),Jeffrey Wright, Ed Harris, Ingrid BolsÃ¸ Berdal, Tessa Thompson, James Marsden, Jimmi Simpson, Angela Sarafyan, Sir Philip Anthony HopkinsBrief synopsisA futuristic Western-themed amusement park allows high paying guests to live out their wildest fantasies without real world consequences.\nWestworld is a theme park with a difference - it enables rich holidaymakers to experience whatever fantasies they possess through artificial consciousness. The park is maintained by robotic 'hosts', who aid the fulfilment of the guests desires. However, the many advances in technology that have taken place since the park opened have meant the hosts have become increasingly lifelike over the years.Now, they've reached a point where they are growing more and more self-aware and have a stronger grasp on reality, that reality being that they are simply there to carry out a function. After this long, it would appear that the hosts have had enough, and the ultimate rebellion starts to get underway.Westworld is that other kind of sci-fi, the type that is focused on using technology and the future world to explore who we are as people. The series is about what it means to be sentient. It's about the choices we make. It's even about religion and, increasingly as it goes on, a series about playing god. 9/10THESEVIOLENTDELIGHTSHAVEVIOLENTENDS\n9/10"
"'I was not too eager to start watching this series - I am not into sci- fi too much, I am not a huge fan of Nolan Bros., and I have not seen the 1973 film of the same name. But, on the other hand, one should widen your horizons and names like Ed Harris, Anthony Hopkins, Sidse Babett Knudsen, and some others were solid and convincing.Well, the first episodes were not too promising - the pace was slow, the scenes and ideas confusing, and I did not know what to expect or what was really going on (as mentioned, I was totally unaware of the subject matter). But then, gradually, when some issues were clarified and constant references to the past and reps started make sense, I began to live and feel together with both main characters and the ideas of this series, not paying so much attention on the sci-fi portion. The performances were at least good, if not more, and the criminal features and angles (what I always like) started to override the other nuances and aspects. The settlement, however, did not correspond to my taste fully, and pondering on and over human significance, fate, etc. has been expressed and dissected in many more dynamic and even works before.Thus, that is why only 7 points from me. I could name tens of series more mellowed and catchy, with less blunt reasoning on mankind\'s place in the world.'"
Its a good show. The whole concept and all. Its just not for me. Its a very interesting and flexible show in terms of story.Its just about people and robots in a bizzaro world.Its basically our reality while we aren't in it.\nWe can't do anything but accept the lies and tyranny.Verdict: Watch it if you want. Its just not for me.
"'I bailed on this show after watching ep 2 of the second season, as I felt a contempt for every one of the characters.I just watched the latest S3 ep 9 with high hopes there had been a severe culling of the cast or any improvement at all...to my disappointment, it\'s an even more unappealing show now than when I last viewed.This is a lazy, pathetic leeching off the awesome original show, The Walking Dead, trying to trick viewers into believing the words the walking dead equalizes the two. It does not!I am a zombie fan and even enjoy watching old black and white zombie movies, but out of the dozens and dozens of anything zombie I\'ve ever watched, this is by far outstandingly the worst!My advice to the writers and producers, you have the perfect venue to smoothly get rid of the original cast and start with a clean slate. Start over with a new group, and hopefully you can redeem yourselves a little, from this garbage product as it now stands.'"
"'Very popular zombie series.I am not the biggest zombie fan, but that view seems to work for me here as the zombies in this show are less visible.The first season almost seems like a prediction of what was to come in 2020 as a small community is placed in lockdown (to keep the zombies out) by the military.Suspense, mystery, drama, science fiction, horror, some great characters - there is so much here!However, this is a grim series, so I would suggest viewing in moderation (maybe one season every six months) as when watching too much in one hit - the viewer feels as depressed as the characters in the show.But in a nutshell - a good show.'"

"Quite uncreative, a very conventional Zombie series. It's bad. But people don't see how it is. Bla bla bla. Maybe there is a reason why the original series fast forwarded past this."
Every show has some patient with an incurable disease so they do tests and remedies for everything under the sun ... how can you honestly call this diagnostic medicine and at the center is the great genius doctor house that couldn't find his arse with both hands in a completely lit closet ... children like antic after antic ...everyone is boring to house because he is boring ... a real putz among putzes
"'Hugh Laurie master of being head doctor, jerk, sophisticated, and quirky! This show is so enjoyable it gives me goosebumps often. House M.D. is so well done very much deserves the 2 Emmys earned. Filled with complex circumstances that are bumpy with many accurate or mishaps but more wins than not throughout. The characters go through a lot which is intriguing and always entertaining! Even the simple patients are always worth seeing. I love the show and all interesting facts around it!'"
"'It seems only a jerk can make good television.House was a total jerk, A-Hole and villain of this show. He treats people like garbage and people love it.Do the same in real life and Karen would have you fired, arrested and have your comments removed from social media.This show glorifies A-holeness which is why in 2020 you people are in the condition you are in.\nI also hate the poster. It\'s so silly with some guy sticking out his tongue. Why? That\'s gross.Verdict: I don\'t like House as a character. Complete turn off for a main protagonist.'"
"'With his wife (Rosamund Pike)\'s disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man (Ben Affleck) sees the spotlight turned on him when it is suspected that he may not be innocent.Not being familiar with the source material, most of the twists and turns came completely unexpected. And it was just such a wild trip, one that could be experienced again and again (probably making more sense with each viewing). Affleck is strong here, and Pike absolutely steals the show. Whether this is a contender for Best Picture or Best Director is doubtful, but Pike has a strong shot at Best Actress.Shockingly, Neil Patrick Harris is not as strong of an actor as one might think, though his role is relatively small. Tyler Perry, on the other hand, is amazing and will blow anyone away who thinks of him simply as the Madea guy. The plot slows down a bit in the third act, but overall is a tense thriller that is sure to please any movie fan. David Fincher has not made a bad movie yet.'"
"I've caught this show from time to time and watched a good handful of episodes. I remembered it for the lead doctor character's sarcastic personality, but with an exciting knack in trying to solve puzzling cases. His crack team of doctors were also a worthy addition to the cast and gave the show some added entertainment. Not the most suspenseful or intriguing show I've seen, but definitely worth a look.Grade B-"
"'Season 1 was great.However, characters are cringy, annoying flash is incompetent, and he always needs people to be yelling in his ear to do simple and obvious things.My engagement level for this show died out really fast.Not cool.'"
"'Yes, I know, the fanboys are not going to be happy with this review because most of them live in an alternate universe where ANY comic (graphic novel) that makes it to TV is automatically an object of worship about which nothing unkind can be said.But the pilot, the origins if you prefer, was way below what it should be.Here is the thing. I grew up with the DC world, in real time (the 60s), I have seen every theatrical release of a comic hero ever done, and on this database I am (egad) a top reviewer. So said, and acknowledging the decades-old battle between DC and Marvel for comic supremacy, I was happily surprised when DC endowed Arrow with rich quirky characterizations and great dialog, elevating it to fair competition for AGENTS OF SHIELD. (The latter has the Whedon brothers behind it, the real superheroes of TV writing) I had high expectations for FLASH and not one was met. When I see that tiny grimace on the face of Grant Gustin, I do not see a superhero trying to adjust to his powers, I see an actor trying to adjust to his character. Big difference.The supporting roles in the pilot seem weakly drawn, and the pep talk from Stephen Amell should have come with a warning for diabetics.Sure, this series will find its sealegs over time and the fanboys will forgive almost everything, but the fact remains, a weak start.'"

"Let's start off with one of the best drama shows in television. I agree it may not be perfect and can be unrealistic at time but brought some good humour. The good season were 1-6 but after that it went downhill and became a soap opera but at least it got a decent ending.Most of the characters get annoying in the later seasons and the bearable ones are Louis and Harvey and Jessica. Even though I like mike and Harvey friendship mike becomes more irritating when the season comes later by complaining and whining about everything\nI like Donna in the beginning but after season 5 she became annoying\nRachel is one of the most annoying characters, I've always feel like she always plays the victim all the time\nOh my god I love Jessica Harvey and Louis they bring flare and drama without being annoying unnecessary drama\nOverall it's an excellent show not perfect but still will be an iconic show"
"Early seasons were awesome, 8's and 7's. later seasons are still good with some awesome sprinkled in.Season 6: 8 (1 viewing)\nSeason 7: 6 (1 viewing)\nSeason 8: 6\nenjoyable but mediocre season like season 7, until it finished strong with the last 2 episodes (1 viewing)\nSeason 9: 6 (1 viewing 9/26/19)"
"Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant mind who often ends up in the murkier part of the law to make ends meet. He gets paid for taking the bar exam for other people. He delivers a case of weed for his drug dealing best friend. He avoids the police and ends up in a job interview with lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). As the ace closer of his firm, Harvey often use his instincts to skirt the law and in this case, he decides to hire the law school dropout without a law licence. It's a big deal since it's fraud and the firm only hires Harvard grads. Harvey has his plugged-in secretary Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), rival litigator Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), and mentor Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). Mike falls at first sight for beautiful paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle).This is mostly fun although nine seasons is too long by half. It's over-wrought to the point that the constant yelling becomes a part of the motif of the show. Another part of the motif must be the Toronto for New York non-descript business buildings. As often is the case, the best has to be the cast of characters and the actors inhabiting those roles. It's a great group of actors including a future princess. It's fun to hang out with them in their suits."
I am incredibly impressed with this show and love the fact that it is not your typical lawyer drama. When I first heard of this show I heard good things but the ad just did not do it justice. I wasn't expecting much but from the very first episode I was hooked. The writing is incredibly smart and witty and it feels like the cool organisation in the real world. Some shows you roll your eyes at how absurd it is but the outrageous things in Suits feel completely plausible.There is definitely room to improve and develop on the storyline and I think they have the ability to do this. I will be continuing to watch this show for a while to come and think it will just get better and better.
"'So, the WB puts out some really, really bad programming. Then there\'s this one, which reminds me of Northern Exposure in very peculiar ways: small town, quirky characters, odd occurances (deer ramming into Jeep; swan attacking Jess, etc.). The writing is sometimes a tad pretentious for its own good, but the well developed characters and the more frequent high quality writing make it worthwhile to wade through. Although I know how TV storylines develop at a snail\'s pace and the WB tries to be a family-oriented network, I still sometimes get frustrated at the tiptoeing the show does around certain issues and situations. It\'s all a lot of fun, however, so if you\'re free Tuesday nights ... then take a look (although, if you\'re on this site, then you probably already have). I\'ve read some of the other reviews in here and it seems to me I need to mention: hetero-male ... longtime viewer (maybe since episode three).'"
"'Over the last couple of years I watch Gilmore Girls on my NBC affiliate out of Richmond, VA every week late nights on Mondays the previous episode of it is shown, and I\'ve been hooked to it because I don\'t get the WB. The writing and scripts of this show are so interesting and lovable you have Lorelai Gilmore as a thirty year old single mother, which is played wonderfully by Lauren Graham. Lorelai tries to raise her college-aged daughter Rory Gilmore, while at the same time deal with love and relationships in her small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai is witty, and a feisty coffee addict while working at the local hotel inn, yet she shows a toughness in dealing with her daughter Rory who could quote an oxford dictionary, plus dealing with the Grandparents isn\'t easy when they try to side with Rory, Lorelai always holds her head high and love conquers all. While this season the show seems to be losing some luster and good stories, it\'s still interesting with the love triangle that Lorelai has with Luke. To sum it up this is still in my opinion one of the better and most underrated shows around why Lauren Graham doesn\'t receive more credit and awards is beyond me, she is sexy and has a sharp witty intellect.'"

Adapting her own novel, screenwriter Gillian Flynn sets up an intriguing first-half, with the benumbed (and unfaithful) husband at first courted and then reviled by the ever-present media. But the second and third acts of the film are where it runs into trouble, ignoring story holes and stumbling over plot-points. The final scenes, which are dragged out interminably by director David Fincher, are so static and unconvincing as to be ridiculous, mitigating his fine work in presenting this lurid tale (the picture ends up being all about presentation and little else). The central couple (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) are thoroughly unlikable, detestable people, while most of the supporting characters (with the exception of a likably dry police detective played by Kim Dickens) are equally appalling. There is really nothing in Gone Girl to engage our interest except for Fincher\'s jagged, nasty way in telling a juicy story--but here, the juice leaks out early. ** from ****'"
"I decided to watch this show and give it a go but I found it to be boring, and more importantly dull.....Dull.There is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull, there is far too much talking and the character Lorelai...just keeps talking on and on and on.... During a second glance felt like suffocating the characters, the banter doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap show....I can't believe this show survived past the pilot.... This seems to be a show which forces the 'Listen to your parents' line....No actual drama exists....Should have stayed a pilot.....and a pilot alone..."
"First off the cast is top notch. This use of big time movie stars to do TV series really raises the standard. Matthew is becoming a great actor not afraid of looking terrible. Woody is intense and just as good at drama as comedy. Oh dear Alexandra, don't think I can see you in Percy Jackson stuff anymore! Michelle Monaghan is pretty here and a bit too pretty for a small town cop's wife but never mind.The two time frames are quite well differentiated they are aged appropriately with effective hair and makeup so it's not confusing.The thick drawls can be a bit hard to understand. The main problem is that the plot is revealed through some of these mumblings and it makes it easy to miss plot elements. Should not have to concentrate so hard to decipher the plot.So far the crimes aren't that interesting but it's early days after only 3 episodes. Hopefully it picks up."
"Purely based on the excellent actors and their skills I rate True Detective at seven stars. But that's just because the actors are really top notch. You can't fault any of them. Remarkable acting. But other then that this show is way too complicated to make it have a better score. And that's a pity. The amount of different characters make it difficult to watch. It's sometimes also a bit slow. I just finished the second season and the ending was disappointing. But for the rest you get a show with excellent filming, excellent sound and excellent actors. I don't get why they want to make it so complicated. Just simplify it a bit and you get one of the best series on television. If they would make a third season I will probably watch it. But to me they can just stop after those two seasons. There are way better shows then this one."
"'/refers to Season 1/I tend to like gloomy crime series, where felonies are not glamorized and detectives do not look wealthy fashion models, but as for the plot, there are 2 options for me: either the evildoer is latent to the very end, or he/she is known from the beginning and one can follow his/her actions and law enforcement efforts to catch and punish. Here, the content is focused on detectives only - in past and present, the pace is protracted, and the essence of the crime and the offender\'s person were evident too soon. Thus, both the pre-ending and ending are rather trivial as well.True, Matthew McConaughey as Detective Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart are splendid, there is a good chemistry between them regardless how they get along, but the rest are just good (perhaps due to non-elaborated characters), and there is no fitting antagonist present who could provide intensity and witty nuances to potential cat-and-mouse play. And last but not least: the almost 8 hours is too much, it could have been easily shorter twice, or a 2-3 hours TV-movie.'"
"Dr Temperance 'Bones' Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works at the Jeffersonian (read Smithsonian) Institute in Washington DC. Along with an interesting team of scientists we also have Special Agent Seely Booth an FBI Agent who acts as the liaison with Dr Brennan when her skills are necessary for an investigation, which is not surprisingly quite often.Initially I expected this interesting series would run out of steam in trying to come up with situations where the FBI required the assistance of a forensic anthropologist. Surprisingly though some may find the realism stretched somewhat I think it works for the most part.For those interested in the forensics the science comes across as interesting at least to a layman, much as it does in the original CSI series. The other strength of the show is relationship dynamics, the most important of which is between Dr Brennan and Agent Booth. The close relationship between the two characters is seemingly unlikely because of their differences but it works very well.The series is based on the life and the novels of Kathy Reichs who like her character is both a Forensic Anthropologist and a best selling author."
"'Bones is a great show, one with fine acting and interesting oddball characters. It\'s one of those detective-forensic shows that are all the rage nowadays, but you know what, it\'s all good fun. Based on the real-life experiences of a real forensic expert Kathy Reichs, Dr. Temperance Bones Brennan (Emily Deschanel) is the star of the show, the preeminent medical expert at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. A bit socially unskilled but every bit dedicated to her work, she and her team of equally socially unskilled oddball co-workers work together to solve murders where many times all they have are bones to go on. On the justice side of it, is Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz, of Angel) of the F.B.I., who often teams up with Brennan to go after the bad guys. This is a fun show, one of those shows that you can watch over and over again and not have to really think about it too much. It\'s just pure entertainment; what more could you want?'"
"I like Bones in spite of the silly and often inaccurate pretensions this criminal investigation drama is built upon. Bones is a low EQ high IQ forensic anthropologist who solves murder mysteries using the assumed power of science. The reality of forensics however is nowhere near as analytic as this show would have you believe. Its an imprecise art more than a science and as such its prone to error. The other limitation, with Bones, is it is inclined to be a bit corny and clinched, at times. This is exacerbated by the shows tendency to make rather shallow, moral judgments, that, like the shows forensics, simply don't stand up too well to scrutiny. Casting these shortcomings aside what makes Bones work for me is the interplay between the main characters. The cast of actors work well together and compliment one another.The relationships that develop between them also give this show a sense of family that is familiar and at times charming. Bones lack of emotional intelligence leads to some genuinely funny moments too. The episodic stories are innovative with enough interesting plot twists and turns to keep the viewers attention. Definitely worth a hour or so of your time (just not over dinner as some of the forensic scenes can be a bit graphic)."
"'Amongst the sea of crime shows clogging up the air waves, this one is better than most. The casting, acting and writing are above average. Personally though the gratuitous use of graphic gore gets to be tiresome. It seems like the writing staff sit around and compete to see how they can introduce more disgusting situations each week when in reality bodies do not decompose at the rate they depict and for the most part are intact. This, in addition to how the squints can pinpoint locations and facial recognition from some of the most far fetched ways detracts from what is basically a pretty good series. There are some interesting characters, but also many inconsistencies in their behaviours/development. As the seasons progress, there tends to be an overemphasis on their sexual personal lives which is typical of Hollywood agendas.'"
"Bones has always been a formula show - find body, look at skeleton, see cause of death, track down killer. Along the way, we get a glimpse into some unique social sub-culture, giving Brennan the opportunity to play cultural anthropologist and explain human behavior to Booth in her own twistedly uber-scientific way. Yet, even after 80+ episodes I find myself NOT tiring of the formula, thanks to the great chemistry between the leads, plus the likable gang of supporting characters - Hodgins, Sweets, etc. - and the continuing high production values and well thought out mysteries. Plus one of the greatly appealing aspects of the show - the idea that we are eavesdropping on people working at the very cutting edge of forensic technology - also has not gotten old. Nor has the will they, won't they nature of the relationship between the two principals. Normally one of these slow burn Remington Steele romances has a best before period of about three seasons, after which the viewer loses interest over things apparently not going anywhere. Here, though, the unique nature of the Brennan character makes the slow approach logical and necessary. The show is still operating at the high level of quality, interest and creativity that initially made it a hit and fans of the show will not be disappointed by the latest season."
"'Scully says to Mulder You want to believe, you so badly want to believe. Mulder responds I do believe. This simple exchange between Mulder and Scully re-ignites that age old question...Is their life on other planets and are there actual alien abductions of humans? It was this intense exchange between the two main characters that draws you right back in to the success of the original 1993 ground breaking Science Fiction series. Are we witnessing a bigger conspiracy than the Manhattan project? What was the outcome of the Manhattan project? Was this the cause of the initial entry of aliens to earth that the government kept secret for the past 70 years?There is so much information that Mulder and Scully are provided by the new rich guy Tad O\'Malley (played by Joel McHale) that we the audience may start to believe that our own government is the biggest conspirator of hidden agendas and that the government would actually blame the cataclysmic outcome on our neighboring nations that would result in World War III. Or worse is there a global warming theory that has the elitist heading to another planet as the world is destroyed? I just loved that the great character actor Rance Howard was provided a part in the pilot episode as he divulges critical information to Mulder.It is a great start for the re-boot. Too bad it will be limited to only 6 episodes.'"
"I have a huge amount of love for Gone Girl, it helped to re-ignite interest into a genre of films that had really started to die off, the mystery. I firmly believe Gone Girl inspired the likes of Girl on the Train to be made, another great book in its own right, but Gone Girl showed that a mystery could be made into a movie that would pack out cinemas.I read the book and loved it, I loved the film too, I thought the characterisations were superb, so my words are based purely on the film.You'd think they're the couple that had everything, she's successful, beautiful, wealthy, charismatic, the perfect wife. He's handsome, funny, with a jaw line you'd kill for, but not all is at it seems.The plot is awesome, the misdirection is excellent, an hour in, and you realise that what you thought was happening isn't necessarily so.Terrific, great music, well acted, humorous, it's a cracker. 9/10"
"X-Files is an iconic show. It had a great run.The show is about Aliens and supernatural occurrences. 2 mellow detectives are put on the cases to find out what's going on.The acting, story the theme song the music, many episodes were just gold. Back then X-Files, King of the Hill and Simpsons owned Sunday evenings.Verdict: Theme song plays in your head..."
'Schitts CreekThe lot seasons 1 - 6Loved it!This show is one of those rare occasions when it excellence surpasses criticism.'
I have enjoyed watching this comic show. It helps when you have great characters and writing. I especially love Chris Elliot's character as the mayor. Everything about this show is first rate!\n*** out of ****
"Do not expect too much out of this drama, but Schitt's Creek has it's way to entertain the viewer, with the simple plot and the nice character build up. Thoughout the four seasons (that's where I'm now!!) the characters experianced huge changes that didn't come overnight or served to you in the gasp of a few episodes. So, because it manages to entertain and it didn't follow the same plot and theme for all its seasons, 7 out of 10."
There was nothing resembling a good joke in the pilot episode and everything was as predictable as yesterday's weather. Rich family thrown out of their mansion yet they own an entire small town? I don't get it. The show is like a bad episode of Green Acres and they were all bad. So we begin with a tired premise and from there we are given stock characters without a trace of humor or originality and then there is the fact that the writing is amateurish. One of the gags in the first episode is the doors are taken off their motel rooms. I don't get it. How is that funny? Don't answer that because I already know the answer: it isn't funny. The two children are completely annoying which isn't synonymous with funny. Toilet humor rears its ugly head early on. Comedy has gone to this little town to die.
Clever and sexy...but after season two it's nothing but nonsense...
Omg I love this show I thought I will hate because of twilight but I was wrong. The acting and storylines are decent.I will rate it perfect if it didn't go downhill after season 4 and if elena was not being stupid half the time
"'Television meet Twilight! The Vampire Diaries is Vampires meets a soap opera. I have watched a full 15 minutes of the show, and other bits and pieces here and there of The Vampire Diaries, while my wife is glued to the show. Here are my deductions of The Vampire Diaries First deductions everyone is hot or good looking on the show. Too much eye candy! Second the Twilight recurring theme of rival vampires, witches, and who is going be turned into a vampire reminds me of some sort of high school click. Romance/drama forbidden love. One girl has the hots for the other\'s boyfriend. The show has the usual soap opera sub plots back stabbing, infighting, lies, secrets. I miss the entertainment value of the show but my wife loves it. I give the show a 2 and my wife give it a 9/10.'"
"Last kingdom Is nowhere near big-budget productions like Vikings and other recent medieval shows. It lacks any artistic perspective and visuals to back it. No actor can Carry the credability of hardened bloodthirsty Vikings. Costumes feels just tacked on modern day dudes, its B level at Most and not convincing like Vikings and GOT that can be mature. First episode is about a annoying boy who can't act at all, its laughable bad and the drama that follows is not very convincing. A few losers in the kingdom blabbering like old ladies while vikings knocking at their front door. And it gets worse. Its so boring and full of plotholes. It doesnt possess the gritty, feral, Dark and intriguing bits like other tvshows allready has. Fighting scenes are truly bad, no good erotic scenes either. You want this kingdom get burned down the more you watch it.\nI just can't see where all the positive reviews comes from? the last kingdom is something you watch when you absolutely has nothing better to do. Its sub-par with any other random boring medieval show. You watch it and forget about it."
'I love this show It has it all history drama comedy great writing along with settings and acting I have just started to watch the series from the first season again it is that good .I think this show and Vikings are 2 of the best action packed captivating and superb historical dramas of the decade. Such a shame as I think it is on its last season as is Vikings I will miss such excellence'
"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is, quite simply, a breathtaking movie. It's the granddaddy of all serial killer flicks, a film that even the almost-as-good SE7EN can only aspire to, a movie that gets into the mind and soul of a serial killer like few others. It inspired a huge sub-genre of similar movies that came out during the 1990s and 2000s, and it's up there with Hitchcock's PSYCHO as one of the most gripping looks at the subject matter of all time.Where to begin? There's a pitch-perfect Jodie Foster, gradually leading us into the depths of the storyline as the naive FBI agent, and the oft-overlooked Ted Levine who excels as the supremely skin-crawling Buffalo Bill. Of course, the film is dominated by Anthony Hopkins, giving the best and most memorable performance of his career in just 16 minutes of screen time. Hopkins chills you to the bone in this, and Jonathan Demme's direction is a perfect match for his talents.The storyline is engaging, ably mixing the criminal investigation strands with scenes involving the killers themselves. There are gory and monstrous set-pieces which make your flesh crawl while watching, yet it's all rather restrained and intellectual, a surprise given the subject matter. Most importantly, it's never less than gripping and completely frightening. A true masterpiece of a movie."
"The Last Kingdom is a compelling, if somewhat confusing, historical drama. The key character Uhtred is a man caught between worlds. A Saxon raised as a Viking, who then returns to his Saxon roots. What I find confusing is why does he stay? The Saxons treat him like dirt, whilst he has an open offer to join the loyal son of his dead Viking father. I can see why the dynamic has been set up this way but perhaps, like others, I'm wondering when Uhtred will see the light and change sides. The acting in this series is excellent. Indeed, aside from a few inconsistencies in the plot, this series is a polished affair in all respects. Eight out of ten from me."
"Set 75 years after Kirk's original 5-year mission, I liked this series as it kept up with the excellence the original series provided:quality, writing,stories,acting, and science fiction. This by a close call ranks as my favorite Star Trek series."
"This show continues the excellence provided by the original Star Trek. Set some 75 years after Kirk's adventures, The Next Generation was an excellent show and provided state-of-the-art special effects. I recommend it to any science fiction fan."

"Set in the 24th century and decades after original crew of the starship Enterprise, the new Enterprise NCC 1701-D is commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).This is a follow up to the TV series (1966-69) and the success of the movies made after. This is a slightly more flashy setup. They're using more CG. The big addition is the holodeck, an artificially created environment, which is basically a virtual reality. This series is most notable for restarting the series with a sequel and new characters/actors. This would lead to even more movies. It is definitely a worthy continuation of the Star Trek universe. That is not always a guarantee especially for an iconic series like Star Trek."
"'I can probably list so many adjectives to describe how good this show is because it delivers so many things. Intrigue and creativity are at the top of the list. From a strong season 1 and some stellar performances, this show went to even greater heights with excellent writing in season 2. Netflix has produced a high quality show that is enjoyable and makes me want more.8/10'"
I would give it six stars if possible. \n1. Great cinematography especially color effects; angles; editing. \n2. Really intelligent dialogue for a crime series. \n3. Acting - top of the game. \n4. Storyline creative; challenging; unexpected twists. Doesn't contain the often used filler to sell more time - always contributing to story. \n5. Up there with True Detective; Orange is the New Black; Game of Thrones; Orphan Black; The Wire; Sherlock; Peaky Blinders.
'Fan of Seinfeld and watched all seasons of this series. Season 9 shows it\'s time to pack it in and retire. The episodes are not as satirical as before and greater reliance is placed on star power cameos to carry them. It\'s always best to go out on the highest note possible. That should be now as another season on this trajectory will be a disaster.'
"The series was actually surprisingly good. There were plenty of funny moments and the main character was entertaining. The rest of them were ridiculous and I've found myself often rooting for Larry and sympathising with him, even though he is a difficult character to begin with. However, the series was entertaining overall."
"'There are few men working on television today that rival the wit, the insight, or the genius of Larry David. To compare Curb Your Enthusiasm to Seinfeld is preposterous. With Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David has created one of the greatest comedic series one have ever seen on American television. Fortunately for us, we got hooked right away from his first year and we sadly miss a new installment, which we thought would be forthcoming in the 2004-2005 season.Most of the episodes have been directed by Robert Weide, who seems to be attuned to Mr. David\'s kind of comedy. The episodes directed by the other guest directors are fine as well, but it seems that Mr. Weide gets the best out of all performers in the ones he is at the helm.The cast is flawless. Larry David is always enjoyable playing himself, something that is no small accomplishment. He is just a natural. Cheryl Hinds plays Larry\'s wife with a lot of style. Jeff Garlin, as Larry\'s manager, is good. Many talented performers are seen in different episodes among them, Sisie Essman, Wanda Sykes, Richard Lewis, and Ted Danson.Curb Your Enthusiasm has a quality that most other sitcoms don\'t have and it is the ability to amuse us even in reruns! This happens because of Larry David\'s tremendous intelligent approach to comedy.'"
"Martin Scorsese explores the life of organized crime with his gritty, kinetic adaptation of Nicolas Pileggi's best-selling Wiseguy in Goodfellas.It stars Robert De Niro,Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta.This is a true-life account of mobster and FBI informant Henry Hill,who happens to be a small time gangster that takes part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito.His two partners kill off everyone else involved in the robbery, and slowly start to climb up through the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, is badly affected by his partners success and decided to bring about the downfall of his mob partners.Goodfellas has one great achievement about organized crime and the mob.It portrays the benefits of being part of the mob and at the same time puts guilt upon them and never glamorizes them one bit.Also,it narrates man's constant lust for power and greed.Overall,this is one great crime classic."
"'Diversity is good but Jimmy Olsen has red hair and freckles, for God\'s sake! He\'s not a tall Black basketball player! Also, too many people know who she is! It\'s not much of a secret! Special effects look pretty good and Supergirl certainly looks the part. Wrong hair color! She should be a blond, not strawberry-blonde! Good casting! The violence is a bit intense. A villain\'s death in the pilot was unnecessary, in my opinion, even if it is a Krypton alien. Some good touches: A man is stronger than a girl even on Krypton and although invulnerable by Earth standards, not totally so against fellow aliens. Please don\'t turn this into another Buffy series, please! Future episodes will tell. Even Smallville was bad for a while with it\'s monster of the week concept. The airplane rescue scene was fabulous and so were Dean Cain and Helen Slater as her Earth parents. Allie Mcbeal is the perfect foil as Kara\'s overbearing boss. We shall see about the rest. Superman should show up from time-to-time too. Who will play him?'"
"I don't overthink tv shows made for recreation!\nI don't criticize and mumble about logic...\nAs long as the show holds my attention and makes me feel something for the characters ,I'm happy with it! And this show delivers!Kinda like Sopranos with biker setting!Very well done!"
"I know that people say this all the time about a ton of different shows but Sons of Anarchy is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created and is easily one of my 2 or 3 favorite shows of all-time! I just got done watching the entire series for a second time through and it was just as good the second time around as it was the first! Every season is just as amazing as the others, which everyone knows is really rare for a tv show but which this one pulls off. I really can't say enough about this amazing show that hasn't already been said, all you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! Do yourself a favor and just go watch it!"
"I haven't seen a series in a long time that has such a simple story told - dadg already old school. The story follows a strictly straightforward action, without complicated side paths. That works amazingly well in a modern series era, in which storytelling in particular is constantly being tried to increase. At Sons of Anarchy everything stays simple, direct and in your face. Just like the clientele in which the series plays. Angry rocker gangs that fight through life with brutality and simple laws. Amazingly entertaining and sometimes shocking for such a genre."
"Best comedy show in decades, where's the movie, or better yet another season"
"Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) is a lawyer with a degree from Columbia (the country) who is on the verge of being disbarred. He enrolls in Greendale Community College, and tries to get close to Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs) by tutoring her on Spanish. The film obsessed weirdo Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) mistakenly invites divorcÃ©e Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown), former drugged up Annie Edison (Alison Brie), slightly dim former high school football star Troy Barnes (Donald Glover), and cranky old rich guy Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase) to the study session. They form a study group and a new family of sorts in this ridiculous lower education center.Show runner Dan Harmon has created one of the most unique network TV comedies around. It has the group friendship that is the bread and butter of network TV. It forms the backbone of the show. The comedy is very sarcastic and throws a lot of references around. Dan Harmon and his writers obviously love TV and movies. I love the group, but I'm in love with the comedic material. You don't have to be Abed to like this show, but it sure would help. The low viewership finally catches up after 5 seasons."
"'It all started with The Flintstones, I suppose. In its time, it was novel. Since then we\'ve had a number of versions of the dumb dad cartoon. This one was recommended to me by a reader because it is edgier than the others.Here\'s the formula we have to all these: Simpsons, South Park, this.Three elements to the formula:Â The story which involves some hairbrained situation which has an old fashioned moral. No matter how risky or gross the humor, it is justified by this.Â A carefully metered dose of edgy jokes about sex, religion and politics, sometimes death.Â Shifts from the story into self-referential alternative worlds from other TeeVee shows. This is what my friend thought I would like, mostly because it is so prominent. The notion is that these characters all know they are in movieland and that all their jokes and doings are from that world. So they move seamlessly from their town into other worlds.Seemed like tame stuff to me. That\'s because of the limits of TeeVee I suppose. See what the South Park guys did with the big screen without these limits. I\'m not impressed.Ted\'s Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.'"

New Girl is so delightful and hilarious! I absolutely love the cast they're superb. The writers wrote everything so perfectly in my opinion I'm sure the series stays mostly entertaining. I'm glad IMDB's rating is 7.7 definitely deserves it!
"'Martin Scorsese-directed modern-day mobster drama adapted from Nicholas Pileggi\'s book Wiseguy by Scorsese and Pileggi involves Brooklyn youth in 1955 who gets drawn into the gangster lifestyle, first as their gopher, later as a major player. Joe Pesci is frightening as a psychotic ball-buster and won a Supporting Actor Oscar, yet Ray Liotta is even better in the central role, and Lorraine Bracco is excellent as Liotta\'s wife. Exceptionally well-made film is gratuitous in its usage of a certain expletive and cannot overcome one major obstacle: despite its attempts to show the ugliness of Mafia life, the movie is constantly undermined by a distinct romanticism of its own violence. The infrequent narration by both Liotta and Bracco is a distraction, as we are often being told exactly what we\'re seeing on the screen, but the creeping paranoia is palpable and the drama played out is disturbing and gripping. **1/2 from ****'"
"'I have watched every episode of New Girl, but sometimes I consider stopping. Why? Because this show take quirkiness beyond what is funny sometimes. The writers of this show apparently think that silly = funny. Sometimes it does, but if characters\' actions and words seem to have no purpose than to be weird, the humor loses its edge.I compare this to Suburgatory which is also a quirky show, but it retains its edge through clever writing that includes insight, parody, and critique.I love the cast of New Girl. I have always been a fan of Zooey Deschanel. Hannah Simone is beautiful and talented. Actually, all of the leads have talent. I just wish they were given roles that allowed them to say clever things, i.e. perceptive things, sometimes. Most of the dialogue is just silliness.'"
"New girl had a nice, solid first season. It was funny, it was witty, it was interesting, it had the friendship, woman-man dynamics and americans in their late twenties living together theme. Second season was just mediocrity. Third season tried to hard. For the fourth season, I've decided to get advise from the fellow viewers and their reviews about it and I came to a conclusion that it is just a waste of time. So, maybe watch the two first season and leave it there, if you want to try this one, something that the producers of this show should have done as well. Or at least, they should have provided fresh material and entertaining jokes. The characters change in the blink of an eye and not in a good way. The romance is just boring, the jokes old and tiring after being repeated for some seasons now, the actors look like they themselves got tired of this show and overall, the plot drags. So 3 out of 10."
"New Girl has made a star of actress Zooey Deschanel. She plays Jess, a teacher who moves in with three male friends in a loft warehouse. I caught this show on and off for the last three seasons. This show is quirky sometimes more so and can be either annoying or charming. The show isn't filmed in front of the audience and done on location in Los Angeles, California. I love Max Greenfields Schmidt character who is playing a Don Draper type character. I don't know how long this show will go on in seasons. Zooey is talented and charming as Jess. But we know sitcoms have a shorter life expectancy than dramas. I relate to Jess in some parts."
"Riveting performances all the way through, many parts give me the best goosebump feeling! Jodie Comer is gorgeous and one of the coolest assassins to me! Very well deserving every award, praise and otherwise supporting it! Sandra Oh is an outstanding actress; her acting is sublime perfection. I'm blown away barely anyone hasn't recommended Killing Eve to me before. If anyone wants to watch one of the greatest shows ever made with incredible suspense this is the perfect treat for you, if not at least I put my thoughts out."
"Killing Eve has been superb viewing from start to finish, credit to the BBC for creating something this good, and thumbs up for putting it on Saturday nights, it follows on from the success they had with Taboo.The story is fantastic, huge credit to Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for writing something so clever, so dark, yet so humorous, it really has been a thrilling ride. If I'm totally honest I must say the key factor to the show has been Jodie Comer, she has been utterly sensational, a part she could have easily overplayed, but to her credit she made Villanelle very sincere. Sandra oh, David Haig and Fiona Shaw all utterly brilliant also.The music throughout was fabulous, that song 'I had to kill you,' fitted in perfectly, it all worked so well together.Great production values, it looked awesome.Addictive viewing. 9/10"
"Eve is a bored, whip-smart security services operative whose desk-bound job doesn't fulfil her fantasies of being a spy. Villanelle, is a talented killer who clings to the luxuries her violent job affords her. These two fierce women, equally obsessed with each other, will go head to head in an epic game of cat and mouse, toppling the typical spy-action thriller.Jodie Comer plays Villanelle, a gorgeous, magnetic, sociopathic serial killer, all gleeful brutality and spite, in Killing Eve, 2018's best TV show... It's a Killing Eves' twist on the spy vs. spy conceit rewards viewers with an audaciously entertaining show that finally makes good use of Sandra Oh's talents."

"As for Jodie Comer making this series - for me, yes. For someone who's resumÃ© is basically TV series after series she definitely gives us unforgettable drama. Series fits her w/physical challenges; playing w/costuming; getting out of the comfort zone; make believe role playing. Surprising how the Brits can pull off Russian accents. The hospital scene w/the 12 yr old patient in the bed next to her will not be forgotten; set the tone for what was to follow. Increased my rating over season 1."
"This is one of the most complex stories i've ever watched. it's a marvel that they were able to keep it all straight. good music, beautiful cinematography, a huge cast of actors i've never seen but seem to be perfectly chosen. great show.advice: don't stall, binge it. and memorize names, first and lastMy seasonal ratings are 8, 7, 6 (1 viewing, 2/13/2021)"
"'Wow, just better in everything.good direction, picture, cast, story .tempo slow but consistent.watch it in original German wt subtitles.do not read about it or have spoilers.really try to watch the show in German. dub if you cannot endure the reading, but you will miss on voice intonation of actors.So good! trippy story.possibly stranger thing influenced the making of this series, but its very different and much much much better execution and acting.'"
"'Director Martin Scorsese more than puts Nicoas Pileggi\'s Wiseguy on the screen...GOODFELLAS is a high octane crime drama based on the life of Henry Hill. Henry as a young boy, half-Irish, half-Sicilian and half-Jewish if need be, wanted nothing more than being like the wise guys in business across the street from his home in Brooklyn. Although the neighborhood was impoverished, money flowed like water around the mobsters that Henry idolized. Henry(Ray Liotta) is taken under the wing of Paul Cicero(Paul Sorvino)and would distinguish himself as he rose through the ranks of the crime family. Henry was the golden boy until a reckless deal threaten the security of the family. Knowing he was a marked man, Hill turned informant and New York crime families fell like dominoes.Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay which was greatly enhanced with Scorsese\'s masterful use of soundtrack music to complement the extraordinary story line. Just a few featured in the soundtrack are: Tony Bennett, Jerry Vale, The Moonglows, The Crystals, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin, the Ronettes, Cream and The Rolling Stones.Giving the movie much authenticity is a wonderful cast that includes: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, Frank Sivero, Chuck Low, Gina Mastrogiacomo and Frank DiLeo.'"
"You may have slept on Netflix's German-language production Dark, and that was a mistake. The trippy time-travel series received comparisons to Stranger Things when it premiered, but it's actually much deeper and more evocative of Twin Peaks. Weaving a twisty tale about four interconnected families in a small German town, the show is worth the effort of the mental gymnastics required to understand the wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey nature of its storytelling."
"'It represents the best part of a wise crafted serie. In same measure,the serie is a portrait of a community. And great plot, defined more by nuances than by colors. A serie about webs of past. And about reconciliation with yourself. Travels, questions, a large puzzle. And a profound good serie about shadows, people and truth.'"
"..they really had it going most of the way pretty good in the pilot episode. There were several sub-plots pushing the believably boundaries, but for the most part they didn't cross-over... and acting overall was solid. Then it came to the first episode ending, and they really didn't do themselves any favors at all (and it really wasn't necessary). Now they've got to work at getting the thinking audience back on track. With that blunder, they dropped a rating notch or two, for it opens the door to a possibility of more of the same, and that could send a good portion of the audience off to the exits. Time will tell, fortunately we don't have to wait long."
TV is dead and this show proves it. Which demographic is this aimed at? Leftie white cat ladies with pink hair?\nThis shoe is so cringe it's funny.
Had to switch off 14 mins in as the inevitable happened the crappy teenagers started to argue and fight and squabble. It's not a sci fi series just a futuristic soap featuring these tedious brats.
"This season of The 100 stresses the fact that despite our moral compasses we all have devils inside us whuch have to be overcome in order for us to heal and move forward. For some, it's a more prominent force and takes several mistakes to drive the sword through the demon, although the heart-wrenching journey and action of the battle is an out-of-this-world experience.Clarke's journey starts when she meets her counterpart in the form of Josephine Lightbourn (Sara Thomas), a thrilling sociopathic princess with more depth, wits, and complexity than any anti-hero is allowed to have. Being stuck inside her own head gives the female lead ample opportunity to reflect and straighten out her choices with the help of a few blasts from the past.Eliza Taylor does an outstanding job with her acting in the way she portrays Clarke, Josephine and the one as the other. She switches skins with careful ease and a perfect amount of the imposter's characteristics. Clarke's compassion subtly shines through during the ruse, while Josephine's lack thereof is just as clear.While this is absolutely Clarke's season, most of the characters have to face-off with their previous mistakes."
"'It looks to me, based upon some reviews here, that many viewers gave up on this show within the first few episodes, before it had even begun to demonstrate the basics of the show\'s story.The 100 begins with a remnant of Earth society, orbiting Earth years after an apocalyptic event. Due to circumstances, 100 of them--teens and young adults--are sent to an unknown fate on Earth\'s surface, where they set up an elementary society and try to survive in dangerous environs.Grounders are living on the surface, as are at least two other societies of people. The plot hits its stride when the remaining satellite people also descend to the surface. So many posters complain about absurd plot points, some of which are incorrect or irrelevant. I assume these reviewers refused to watch Star Trek because of absurd story lines and scientific improbabilities. That is their prerogative. But those who can suspend some disbelief will find a complex story about social order and the nature of man. There are some very good actors involved. The visuals are rich. And the cast expands as the characters meet and become familiar with others. I might add, without giving away any spoilers, that the new world of this unfamiliar Earth offers many surprises and a few unexpected secrets.Update 12/16/14: This series has proved that it is on the right track. The plot lines are engaging and the characters are well-defined. I am upgrading my vote to 8.'"
"'after so many time and a lot of books, films, clubs , shows about vampires, it is strange to discover the series seductive like at the first meeting. maybe naive but it is not its sin. maybe soft but it is part of different period. but the same. a new hero, huge challenges, drops of love, horror and a brave girl. nothing new but so seductive ! for a decade it remains one of fundamental marks. for today it is more than a teenager series but a form of delight. because it reflects, in right manner, expectations, emotions and a beautiful story with deep roots. a new kind of hero and her extraordinaries adventures. the structure of each fairy tale.'"
"Buffy may not seem like anything special when first hearing of it, and although it starts as a campy B-horror show, it becomes so much more as it goes along. True, it can be episodic, but that only helps it to have some of the strongest stand-alone episodes I have ever seen on TV, and also some of the most emotionally-involving story lines. Although it's a plot-driven show, it's also about the characterization that comes with it and the different directions in which the writing takes the characters. The mix of comedy, drama, and horror is pretty unique to Joss Whedon, and it's a testament to his talent that no other shows are quite like this one in tone. The show would be nothing without its actors, and for the most part, they surely deliver. Sarah Michelle Gellar's development as an actress throughout the show is pretty amazing, and actors like Alison Hannigan, James Marsters, Emma Caulfield are also among the best and show what they have. Truly, this is a show that stays in the heart. Truly recommended."
"Buffy was one of those shows as a kid you would glimpse at and not know what was going on but at the same time kind of like the show. BTVS was dark, had drama, romance and it's a 90s icon. Buffy back in those days was THE show to watch. Before Netflix and all these cheesy Superhero shows Buffy was dominating the cable network. Buffy knew how to be a show that can make people relaxtained. It's such a classic product that aged very well."
"'A totally amazing film by Director Quentin Tarantino was Inglourious Basterds.A group of Nazi soldiers plans to avenge the deaths of Jews throughout Europe by staging a one group hit team to kill as many Nazis as possible.They are soon drawn into a further plot-the killing of top Nazi officials including Hitler himself at a Nazi premier movie glorifying a German soldier who had killed so many.As the German Commander, Christoph Waltz was superb. His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.'"
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered."
'This a great show. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. See it. It got an 8.2. Which is a good rating. But this is such a great show that 8.2 is underrating. I give 10 out of 10. The movie from 1992 is a little bit better. But still this a great show. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. Godzilla (1998) is better. But only by a little bit. Jaws is also better. Still this a great show. It is better then A Nightmare on elm street. And that is not easy to do.'
"It goes beyond my comprehension that people hate this show. They must all be American brainwashed patriots. Seriously get over it, it's just a show and it's a good one. I absolutely love this show, the actors are all very believable in their roles, the storyline is exceptional, full of twists that keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole show. At the end of every episode I already want to watch the next one as soon as possible. Everything that you think happens in real life when you think about CIA, espionage, terrorists and so on passes the register. Conspiracies, paranoia, double-crossing, betrayal, false promises etc. Clair Danes puts down a brilliant performance playing an unstable CIA analyst. To me the whole series is full of action and suspense. One of the best series!"
I watched around 4 seasons before until I started losing interest cause me and my mom used to watch together. I'm giving another chance and really appreciate this terrorist/CIA based show! Damien Lewis among so many others are so great; the acting is incredible which is understandable Homeland has lasted so long. I absolutely love the beginning credits and gripping story.
"'We were not able to watch this when it was originally broadcast but my wife and I have been watching it now, 2017, via HULU online streaming. When we watch it we usually watch 2 consecutive episodes, sort of like watching a movie.We just finished season 2 and now have started on season 3. The theme of the series is terrorist threats to the USA homeland after the attacks of 9-11. The main character is Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison, CIA agent. Often brilliant, often inappropriate, a highly flawed individual who is always focused on her job, tracking down terrorists and foiling their plots. Sometimes she is successful, sometimes not.Her boss is Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, always a calming influence. In seasons 1 and 2 much of the focus is on British actor Damian Lewis doing a real good American accent as Marine Nicholas Brody, captured by terrorists abroad for 8 years, presumed dead by many including his wife and two children. When he returns as a Muslim the running question is whether he is legit or whether he has become a terrorist also, waiting for the opportunity to take out significant targets.Those 3 actors in those 3 characters make the series interesting. Especially the erratic behavior of Mathison. Danes really is one of the best female actors currently, anyone who missed her performance as Temple Grandin really should look it up.'"

'When did the popeil spray on hair become cool? Was it when homosexuality became a story line? Worst show ever.'
"Actually my mother was a fan before I became one of this show. I can't wait to see it regularly in syndication. The chemistry between CHarlie Sheen and Jon Cryer is absolutely perfect. The Harper brothers are both opposites. The casting of Angus Jones as Charlie's son Jake is quite brilliant. He is so naturally funny to watch on the show. I love seeing Holland Taylor but we don't see enough of her as their domineering, critical mother who could put Marie Barone to shame. She's not that kind of mother who will bake cookies and take her grandson to the zoo. She's a more contemporary grandmother. Anyway it's great to see Conchetta Farrell as the maid, Bert. She's more than just the maid, her timing is just about perfect. I love seeing Melanie Lynskey who I didn't recognize from Heavenly Creatures as lovesick stalker of Alan Harper and neighbor. Her role of Rose is not to be ignored at all. She is quite the up and coming actress. I would have never guessed that she was a New Zealander herself. There is no trace of a Kiwi accent. The show itself has come along way from the beginning and I hope to see more in the future."
"Okay, when this show first started, I actually quite liked it. I found the writing quite funny and creative and I liked some of the interplay between the characters. But over time, Two and a Half Men has become duller and more stale, I feel similarly about How I Met Your Mother too. The production values are good as is Charlie Sheen, the only actor to have any real life in his character, but that's it. The writing and jokes that were once creative are now stale and forced, even lacking in subtlety, while the story lines introduce good themes but don't introduce and explore them well and the stories themselves feel rushed and predictable. The characters are not very likable now, some actually are annoying and act like idiots. Now they've replaced Sheen, while I am overall not impressed with the show, I think regardless of his problems I think replacing him is a mistake, without him the show really is going to be a dead weight even with all the other faults it has. All in all, a decent show when it started, now it is unwatchable and hard to get into. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
"'Like it\'s star Any Poehler (that\'s not a typo, I know what I said), this show was cute, but predictable & ridicously overrated. A cringey & predictable sad-trombone rom-com that was initially saved by the hilariously cynical character of Ron Swanson, but eventually they ruined him by turning him into a rom-com clichÃ© too, and I was done.'"
"This is a good ensemble-cast show (with a lead role) made in the same vein as the office. It generates plenty of laughs despite the lack of a laughtrack-it doesn't need one. Amy Poehler is perfect in the lead role as Leslie Knope, the head of the Parks & Recreation department in a small town in Indiana. She does her best to head her job and her department-often with hilarious results. Rashida Jones heads up a terrific supporting cast. Whether something going on in the city or someone in the department, this comedy finds some sort of hilarious situation in each episode, and the cast clicks perfectly as a workplace type sitcom. Amy Poehler strikes gold! *** out of ****"
"'I have read criticisms of Quentin Tarantino\'s Inglourious Basterds, saying that it glorifies violence or that it glosses over Nazi atrocities. Some people apparently don\'t realize that no part of the movie is meant to be taken seriously. This flick should not be interpreted as a historical film. It is basically a comedic spaghetti western set in WWII.Brad Pitt, playing a none-too-educated (but extremely clever) yokel leading a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers into Nazi-occupied France to kill and scalp Nazis, puts on one of the funniest performances that I\'ve seen in years. And let me tell you, this movie leaves NOTHING to the imagination! As is the case with pretty much any Tarantino movie, this is one that squeamish people should avoid as if it was the H1N1 virus. For non-squeamish people, this is the flick for you! Tarantino is not afraid to show anything and play it for laughs. The scene in the cinema is, in my opinion, the movie\'s highlight: I would rank it right up there with Gene Kelly\'s stroll down the pluvial sidewalk in Singin\' in the Rain.Among the rest of the cast: Christoph Waltz as Nazi Col. Hans Landa, aka the Jew Killer; Diane Kruger as German actress Bridget von Hammersmark, collaborating with the Allies; Til Schweiger as a German-born Jewish soldier with the Americans; Mike Myers as an English officer; and Melanie Laurent as the daughter of a Jewish family, now seeking revenge.All in all, I recommend this movie as much as possible.'"
"'Amy Pohler\'s character, a 34 year old city hall up and comer has just been appointed to the assignment of her career: Head of a committee to turn a hazardous abandoned construction site into a beautiful recreational park. Public support appears to be minimal, yet our heroine presses on.A side plot reveals the star\'s unrealistic ambitions to take public service all the way to the Oval Office, as well as an inferiority complex toward her mother, who (in contrast to young Amy) is a high ranking city official.I\'m a big fan of the star, and I\'m glad she didn\'t retire after having her baby and leaving SNL. The new show Parks and Recreation, styled after the extremely popular Office, offers a few laughs here and there, but leaves very little for anyone to anticipate and look forward to subsequent episodes.This is a spotlight for a very talented comedienne, but I see no chance for anything remotely comparable to 30 Rock coming from this humble sit-com. Unless someone knows something I don\'t know, the buzz should fizzle long before a full season goes on the air.'"
One Piece is so wacky that it's a masterpiece\nWhole Cake Island and Wano Kuni are my favorite arcs
"'I just reached the timeskip and I gotta say thank you Oda for making this masterpiece. One piece will always have a special place in my heart, there are so many great and memorable moments in this anime which makes it just so unique and perfect, I would definitely reccomend this anime.'"
"A pirate named Luffy wants to become the pirate king, but besides that, he is on a quest to go to the Grand Line and organise his own pirate to search for the treasure that that has sent people sailing to the seas, called 'One Piece'.ONE PIECE is an absolutely fantastic and fun anime. Also every episode in the series cannot be missed, since each episode has something to do with the storyline which make the show more and more addictive, unlike some other TV shows. There are even times where it can actually even make you care for the characters, which also make the show surprisingly moving.IMPORTANT: Beware of the English dub because it's been Americanised and politically-corrected to make it a kids show. It's been distributed by 4Kids. So in other words, ONLY watch the Japanese version otherwise the American version will turn you off."

"'Ugh...having watched the first episode of this thing that was my one and only reaction. Some things are best left in the past like mullets and shoulder pads and Karate Kid spin off Cobra Kai is no exception. Putting aside the fact that this thing is badly dated, even more embarrassing is the bad martial arts. Ralph Macchio\'s character in particular comes across as having zero martial arts ability of any kind. For experienced martial artists its painful to watch.On the upside acting wise its not bad. William Zabka is impressive as the down and out martial arts instructor. He can certainly act and yes this man does appear to have real martial arts skills. That said I can not find a lot to praise here. Its simply too dated in a bad 80\'s kind of way. 5/10 from me.'"
'Awesome show. Johnny Lawrence is and has always been the REAL karate kid'

"I heard about this I was surprised, I loved The Karate Kid which came out in 1984, that starred Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Elizabeth Shue, And William Zabka. And part 2 that came out in 1986, but The Karate Kid part 3 that came out in 1989 not so much, but I kind of liked The Next Karate Kid, never really saw the 2010 remake that starred Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan..\nI really enjoyed the show showing how Johnny and Daniel are doing now, and also the other stories that come in the mix. Daniel and Johnny realizing what karate meant to them. There are some throwbacks to the original film, Ralph Macchio and William Zabka get back in there roles perfectly, There are some similarities with original film in some episodes. And the other actors also do well, and the karate scenes are well shot, and the way it ends, I'm eagerly excited for season 2."
"Impressed, captivated and engaged are the words that come to mind for Cobra Kai. This is what we need from shows, to take unique and interesting angles. Cobra Kai flips the script and gives us the view from Johnny Lawrence, this is really his story. He's the one who lost and turns out to be a real person with very real flaws. Cobra Kai intrigues us with its great narrative. No more one dimensional 'Good vs Evil' story we've all been told a million times over. This reflects the feelings of the 'loser' of the memorable 1984 film Karate Kid and picks up 34 years later. Because of this narrative and spin I find Johnny to be an inspirational figure by trying his best to rebuild his life. Johnny is a very down to earth and simple character and is making the most of the hand dealt to him, isn't that how we live our lives? In a funny way we see the arrogance and attitude sometimes from Daniel Larusso who was originally the hero. Top marks for a great show."
"'Oscar-winning film of 1994 with an amazing award winning performance by Tom Hanks. It\'s the story of a slow young man who just seems to be in the right place while monumental events are taking place in this nation\'s history.Hanks has never been better. His slowness is beautifully realized and then audiences know that he is far from the slow person that he is attempting to depict.Sally Field, as his mother, is equally superb and should have been rewarded with at least a supporting Oscar nomination. It was amazing that the Academy overlooked her brilliant performance.Gary Sinise\'s performance as the soldier who ultimately is crippled is also splendid.Life is certainly like a box of chocolates. You know what you\'re going to get. With Forrest Gump, you will get the best of the best chocolates.'"
"Jon Hamm is as appealing in this as he is appalling. You may feel stronger with one of those than the other, but while he is the number one character in this, there is a lot more going on here, than might meet the eye. Especially at first, you may not be able to see it. The women are as much part of the whole show as the (Mad) Men. You could even argue that they have a lot more going on at times.The show itself is slow paced though, which may not go down well with some viewers. You really have to be in the mood for the show, for the setting, the time line and all that surrounds it. I know that Jon was hated as much as he was loved by viewers. Because he had so many flaws, but was also intriguing and had that extra special charisma going for him. It's almost impossible to not be enamored by him.Some lingo may not work or may be confusing too, but in the context, you'll never lose sight of things. You don't have to be in the advertising or management business or having lived ages ago. This does work as a bit of a history lesson. And the acting is superb. Of course as with many (recent) shows, it makes sense to have watched all the seasons from the start ... it's character building, even if nuanced"
"There is plenty of stress to go around in this television series. Practically everyone is drinking and smoking to their heart's content. These are men caught up in a frenzy of an advertising agency. They would literally cut each other up if given the opportunity to do so.There are plenty of modern day issues to tackle as we saw this evening when during a fire at a hotel, it's determined that one of the executives is a homosexual.Everything is supposed to be done nicely and to fit in place. This includes the firing of an executive whose dismissal was held up while his wife underwent radiation treatments. Two people have been promoted to take his place. The fired executive's parting scene was comical. He didn't exactly accept going out quietly.An interesting show, but where can all this lead to ultimately?"
"'Sometimes it happens that even a series rounded-up so well continues to be popular on and on, tempting the producers and performers to exploit its fame and reputation even more. Evidently, it is the case here as well, with additional amount of sophistication and the inclusion of all previous main characters who yet have no more absolutely necessary part to play (e.g. Fernando Sucre and Paul Kellerman). The thrill and pace are in place, Michael and Sara both still pleasant, but the localities and settlement of problems bring forth several clichÃ©s and predictive events on the account of convincingness, particularly the ones taking place in Yemen.Well, most of them who enjoyed all the first 4 season episodes in sequence, would breeze through this sequel without any major frustration, but those who began their first familiarization here would probably be surprised why this series has been praised so much. Being still above average, one can not fully enjoy it as a separate series (vis-Ã\xa0-vis 24, for example).'"
One of the best binge watches of all time gets you absolutely hooked in each and every series. It's a shame it looks like it's done for good now and not likely to be renewed again.
"During the first couple seasons this show was great.Although the premise was a bit thin, a guy robs a bank to go to prison with his brother and then has no problem getting to his brother once inside.A bit far fetched for me but it got really good after that.I was even able to overlook the ridiculous idea of them escaping and then ending up in a South American prison, which they were also able to easily escape.After that it just got stupid.They brought in Michael Rappaport as a cop??Don't get me wrong, I loved him on The War At Home but he is not capable of playing a cop or FBI agent or whatever he was.But that wasn't even why the show got bad, they were just out of story ideas.It's a shame to see such a great show die such a horrible, prolonged death but I'm getting use to it.Watch the first three seasons and act like that was all there was."
"'The first two seasons of Prison Break are absolutely captivating and incredibly well executed but sadly, like so many other series, the show is dragged on far too long and gradually loses its energy and appeal.'"
"I remember my school days and there is one chapter I remember we had in rapid reading section, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Blue Carbuncle. More than half a decade later, I sit here with a smacked gob on how genius people can be.Sherlock follows some of Doyle's works, but the style is extraordinary. With 3 90-minute episodes every series, it really pulls a side story to the beloved bro couple. The writing is very fresh and so in line with the quality that we have today in TV. AMC's Breaking Bad is a strong competitor here.Performances by Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman are what takes the series ahead of all other BBC productions. In fact, the whole cast is par excellence. The first season introduced to the style and here we are in the third season, with a cliffhanger. The music is very melodious and apt for the rather quirky facets of the person the show is based on.The screenplay tries hard to simplify things/dialogs/references but quite fails in some episodes; the fastidious theme aggravates both the viewing and confusion causing factors... For exempli gratia, S01E01 was a 9/10, but S01E02 was only 7/10. But, as we know British TV is much different from its counterparts, Sherlock is a winner.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!"
"'easy to define it - one of great series. smart, example of imagination fireworks, using the basic model in a magnificent manner. and , sure, one of fascinating roles by Benedict Cumberbatch. but that represents only the first level. because it has the gift to be alive. not only good, fascinating or inspired but giving a fresh air who is so rare from series of our period. the game, the solutions, the characters, the mark of a special team behind it, the dialogs and Martin Freeman as the perfect Dr. Watson are answers for the science of profound difference. it is not just a different Sherlock but the same in new package. and the package is so cool...'"
"I read some of the reviews and thought this might be worth watching. Perhaps it's time to put an age on reviewers ???the angst of an adolescent realising they aren't normal and are actually part human, and also a werewolf.sadly, it isn't... it's suitable for teens and sub teens... it's got the boy sees girl, girl likes boy and...it's all really predictable and lame...it's suitable for kids who like buffy etc... it's so not for adults... shame...the story lines don't develop and neither does the characterisation either...suitable for kids..."

"Forrest Gump, I think is a beautiful film. Never too schmaltzy, but there are some genuine tearjerkers like Forrest at Jenny's grave. The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"I just finished last season and I'm slightly disappointed with it, but it does not affect my overall opinion of the show. It is not top quality show, but what could you possibly expect from MTV... At the other hand, for those who love supernatural, show is fast, without idling, so pretty much fun.7/10"
"Really Solid series, Teen Wolf tells the story about Scott McCall who turns in a werewolf. In my eyes season 3 was the best season, season 6 was a dissapointment. I praise Tyler Posey for his head role in this series he did an amazing job. Action was the main genre in this series. They did really banged it.It's a mix of drama, comedy, fantasy and action. Dylan O'Brien takes the comedy side on this series. Added with a good touch of horror you have a good solid series.I watched it in 2 weeks and i really enjoyed this show. I hope for a Season 7 in the future."
"'OMG! So very, very morbid, slow and boring. Scott is so very slow in picking up on anything.Quite the worst of all six. Second time of watching and I am fast forwarding.'"
"Went to college with rich kids who had nothing to do but use drugs with money their parents gave them. They may think this is some kind of profound story to tell people, but to the rest of us, this isn't.For those of us who were raised well, we were told to stay away from drugs. And I mean, I can see people who were addicted to drugs and know that it's trouble. It's kind of sick that Hollywood glorifies losers like Rue. We were told to stay away from people like this. What happens to them never ends well.I have no idea why Zendaya would take this garbage. She's better than this. Hopefully this show doesn't last long so she can find better gigs to take. This is a show by rich kids who are enamored by the lowlifes they didn't get to spend much time growing up with. I did, and I actually work around them, so have at it! I want no part of this.It's not even a trainwreck you can't stop watching like Fleabag either. Hard pass."
"Euphoria is a show that's hard to rate, let alone review.It's an experience like no other for all age groups, especially if you're a teen, relating yourself to the characters on one or more stuffs so disturbing to you and one you struggle withIts depiction of issues is graphic, brutal and honest in a good wayIts acting performance is mind-blowing, crystal clear and muddy at the same time in a so talented wayIts storyline and characters developments deep and award worthyIts musical score and soundtracks wonderful, whiplashing and smooth as doves to the ears at the same timeIts cinematography and shooting gorgeous and up to the pointThat's not a series to review with hundreds words, making the feel of it dull and useless in the process.\nYou give your honest, concise opinion and mine is a big positive one.Watch it, live it and be drugged by it.."
"This series had potential as a gritty yet entertaining updating of the depiction of teens' lives. It's been done before - Skins (the UK version) was particularly good (though only initially: it ran out of steam after about two seasons).Occasionally the series lives up to its promise, with a few stories that are quite interesting and engaging. However, for the most part it is quite dull and unengaging. The central character - Rue - is the main cause of the problem, coming across as superficial, self-absorbed and pretentious. In fact the whole series feels like that, though it might accurately describe teens' lives (!).As mentioned, some side-stories are interesting, but these are not enough to make this watchable."
It's just almost halfway through first season but I can easily say this one of the best high school series I have ever seen. The direction and cinematography of this series is groundbreaking. All the performances are pitch perfect and Zendaya is simply one of the best young actresses. The series talks about many themes which are difficult to take but the creators did a great job. There's high rate of profanity which may trouble some but one can easily understand that it is needed for this series.
'Large parts of the series were dull and boring and despite glimpses until the last 2 episodes it was largely mundane with the odd scenes of development and excitement. However the last 2 episodes were phenomenal and hopefully set the series on the right track moving in to season 2!'
"'The Umbrella Academy puts a spin on the superhero genre, depicting a group of them having to get back together amid a dire situation. It\'s an OK series, not great. I like that they fixed Elliott Page\'s name in the credits to match his gender identification.'"
"A group of once great superhero's come back together after there father who brought them together has a team when they where kids suddenly dies, although they all have led different lives, discover that they all must put there differences aside, in order find out a big conspiracy going on.Quite a fun cast who really bring there characters to life real well, has a good blend CGI and practical effects awesomely well together. Very funny and dramatic too."
"'What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary \'Eggsy\' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world\'s population. If it had been less dirty it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.DVD from my public library.'"
"The series, which runs for 10 episodes, is not an origin story although origins are important. The members of The Umbrella Academy are all grown up now, after a childhood spent in the limelight. One day in 1989, 43 babies were born to mothers who were not pregnant the day before. Seven of them were purchased by an eccentric billionaire, Sir Reginald Hargreeves , who trained them up as The Umbrella Academy to be crime fighters - and perhaps something more.There are a lot of characters presented all at once, but one of the The Umbrella Academy's many strengths is that it understands the importance of a good montage. Those, augmented by a killer soundtrack, help make everyone stand out and immediately recognizable.The Umbrella Academy is quick, quirky, and light, although there are real stakes and consequences that play out over the course of the season.It's frankly difficult to think back to how everything began in this crazy show after having buzzed through its 10 episodes, because it's so full of layered narratives. Don't look up spoilers, though - knowing less is more. Not having read the books, I can't speak to the Netflix series' success as an adaptation. But as a superhero-tinged TV show, it gets everything right. The Umbrella Academy is incredibly interesting, enjoyable, quirky, and well worth your time."
"'the great point is the rehabilitation, in smart manner, carefully, of fairy tale genre. the clash between worlds, the delicate use of magic, the convincing script, the good acting makes things better episode by episode. the basic secret of its success - the desire to seduce not impress. and this ambition has a great role to transform in delight an old fashion story in which the ingredients of modern life are not pieces of adaptation but ladder to deep charm of childhood silhouettes. because it is obvious the respect for classic characters and for the high measure in scenes construction. a series with special flavor. and result of great ambition. remarkable work and useful alternative against blockbusters wave.'"
"'South Park is HILARIOUS!It is very much a satire, but it being animated gives the creators and writers freedom to do practically whatever they want, and there are NO restrictions in this show. The story lines are constantly funny and amusing, and always entertaining. This is a better show and satire than The Simpsons and Family Guy, and hopefully it continues to bring more episodes for a long time. Also, the way that time never really moves or the boys age is part of what gives it freedom to do whatever it wants. This is a show not afraid to make fun of ANYTHING and not afraid to do whatever it can to make us laugh.'"
"'For some reason I stopped following this show long time ago, even before tenth season I think. Recently, again for some inexplicable reason, it came to my mind and I decided to start it all over, from season one, but this time I\'m gonna finish it, or better to say catch it, because I hope it will never end. This morning I finished first season. There\'s nothing better than healthy laughter with morning coffee. After 20 years this season is still fresh and hilarious. One of the strongest tens I ever gave.10/10There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it\'s just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with. - chthon2'"
"'This cartoon series has a very outrageous style of humour that can put some people off, especially the very offensive character Cartman. Yet it is often done in the service of satire that mostly hits the mark. The plots are also very outrageous though I think they ran out of original ideas as the years went on and just started to parody themselves and popular culture like Family Guy.'"
'This show is not funny at all. It is badly written. The hummer is awful. It just gross and stupid. I can not believe this show got an 8.8 . I can not believe people think this show is funny. I think comedy is easy and this proves my point. Do not watch this show. It is an awful show. I need more lines and I am running out thing to say. This show is pooh pooh. There is a character in this show that is a taking pooh pooh. That is proof that this show is not funny it is pooh pooh. Stinky stinky pooh pooh. Do not see this show. This show is a waste of time. The acting in it is awful. This is a very stinky pooh pooh show. Never watch this show it is overrated carp. Do not see it. Life is to short. Never see it.'
"'This crime mini-series is very watchable, but after seeing Big Little Lies and Sharp Objects recently, the bar has been raised very high lately for this sub-genre, and The Sinner is a notch or two below those shows. It has a very intriguing start, but peters out somewhat at the end (the final episode is rather anticlimactic). Also, the direction is not as stylish. But the performances of Jessica Biel, Bill Pullman and Nadia Alexander are amazing; in fact, Biel is the main draw of this series for me, and her absence from the second season is the reason I don\'t think I\'ll be watching it. *** out of 4 for season 1.'"
'Really it is not surprise me...normal story and screenplay with simple twist...that little boy cast was not soo good...other castings same steorotype...'
Life could end at any moment so let's jump off this bridge real quick.....\nYou have the ability to do anything so let's kill people and have restricted abilities for life.\nThis is the logic of season 3. People overthinking life and doing silly things. The guy who I assume is Henry Cavill's skinny brother just acts like an oddball throughout the series. The Sinner could of been an overall great series and I can't believe it turned out like this.

"Director Matthew Vaughn continues His Winning Streak with this Ultra-Violent Send-Up of the Slick Spy Movie. The Movie is so Sleek, Stylish, and Outrageous it is likely to Cause Spontaneous Orgasim among Teenagers and Hyper-Actives of all ages.All the Money spent on this Glorious, Gory, Goof is up there On the Screen. It Razzles and Dazzles in almost Every Scene. The Writing is Smart and Reverentially Reflective as the Tone Fluctuates between Irreverence and Irresponsibility.But a Good Time can be had by Those Willing to Allow for some Gut-Wrenching Displays of Murderous Mayhem and not so easy to take Comedy, like Our Hero's Reward for Saving the World that Ends this Exhausting Entertainment. That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance. Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before. The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.Recommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. as it Parodies he Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control. Behold...This is Art Imitating Life with a Swagger and a Smirk."
"'\'The Sinner\' is a strange drama, rather over-constructed. A woman commits an inexplicable crime, and has seemingly neither any understanding of what she has done, nor apparent interest in getting to the bottom of the case. But a detective, with relationship problems of his own, is interested, and eventually uncovers the story of her awful history and thereby explains the crime. But there\'s little feeling of urgency to the drama, little emotional connection to the characters and sadly little plausibility as well. It feels like someone was trying too hard to make a psychological thriller; but forgot that our psychological motivations are often most interesting when at their subtlest.'"
"'The show has a different atmosphere, darker and more intense than most of the superhero shows. While Supergirl, Smallville, Flash and such reminds me of teenage shows from 90\'s, Daredevil and Jessica Jones are more serious and more movie-like. What I like the most is that the show is based on a good story and not only on superpowers and special effects.7,5/10I just finished the second season and although show now has a faster pace and it\'s more interesting, it lacks persuasiveness. Electra and Punisher are a welcome refreshment, but still, I cannot give it more than strong 7.7/10'"
"'Daredevil is yet another excruciatingly dull, formulaic outing from the Marvel stable. After the awful Agents of Shield and its dismal spin off Agent Carter I had hoped we had seen the last of this cheesy comic book franchise. Sadly that was not to be the case. I should have known better but I took a look at Daredevil. Really there is not a lot to say. Classic US stick about a guy with traditional read conservative values turned vigilante with a hero complex. Like almost all of its counterparts, its driven by melodramatic, often corny, exposition. Forget about meaningful character development or interesting story lines, they are conspicuous by their absence. All in all if you are not selective in your viewing and like lots of guns, fighting and mindless noise, this might appeal to you. If, on the other hand you like interesting, engaging series I\'d give this one a pass. Two out of ten from me.'"
'There are so many superhero shows out there. But Daredevil is different and better in a few ways.The story remains understandable and simple. A viewer should not have to concentrate too hard to keep up with a TV show. 13 episodes means the story doesn\'t have to get repetitive and confusing like in Flash and Shield. Quality is better than quantity. 22 episodes is too much for some shows. One villain is more menacing than a new villain each week.The actors are good. Charlie Cox is a likable and understated actor. The hero is vulnerable and not infallible. Vincent d\'Onofrio is impressive as the villain of the season. His character is well developed. There may not be a bevy of beauties like Arrow but when the story is good it doesn\'t matter.A few faults. The lighting is too dark in some sequences. Things can move slowly in some parts. At first I thought the fighting is a bit too expert for a blind person even with powers. Some fight scenes are a bit too long.CW and ABC could learn from this show. Quality vs quantity. Looking forward to season 2.'
"IF you only watch the first few seasons it's pretty good. It actually starts off decent enough, and had they kept on that track I'd give it 10 stars.But, unfortunately, it spiraled into CW trash pretty fast and what was once a decent and gritty superhero show ala Grell, it quickly turned into Smallville meets The Dating Game.As the show progresses, it becomes more and more muted, more and more toned down, and the gritty darkness that made it good fun turned into shallow CWness.Watch the first few seasons, and then tune out."
"'I only watched seasons 1 and 2. The concept of time travel heroism was fun. The acting is hit and miss and stories were fun to watch. Characters were ll unqiue and indifferent. However, after indulging most of my energy into the father of superhero TV shows Arrow, then having to keep up with the Flash as well as keeping up with the MCU. I became superhero fatigued to sit through another 20-24 episodes of tedious drama that really goes nowhere in terms of my own productivity. LOT is a fun show its just the overwhelming of superhero shows and having to sit through 20-24 episodes is why I stopped watching. Still, once again it was a good series when I was watching.Last Words: Arrow verse was a fun universe. I remember finding Arrow by accident, that one night, and here I am.'"
"'Negatives: 1. LImited, off the shelf, CGI effects. Nothing creative or mind capturing. Nothing creative in storytelling; same old bad guys. 2. No name actors (low production cost) in roles that don\'t require acting, but do require that you can say seven monosyllabic words or fewer in succession while giving the appropriate not believable facial response indicating some emotion. 3. Action consists of lots of hand to hand combat so poorly performed even camera angles couldn\'t rescue the fake punches. Also added were the usual fighting sticks and toy store laser guns. 4. Really bad science (audience probably doesn\'t care or know better) dealing with time travel as if it were like walking out the door. Even more stupid (er) were things called Time Quakes, Temporal Aberrations, Time Scattering, and Time Drive. The premise is if I can say it, it must be true. Wrong! Sorry, time travel, quakes, aberrations, etc. - not possible, all child\'s fantasy. Positive: 1. You get a bit of history; distorted as each event is.'"

"'The Klingons look too different and way too alien! Can\'t they do better than renewing an old blood war with these guys? Unless they wise up and run it on an existing broadcast platform, I will boycott it. I refuse to be held hostage by yet another pay TV service. Besides, it will not run smoothly on my old computer, so I would only be able to watch it on my Smart-phone or I-pad. The only compelling character I like so far is Number One, a female human raised by Sarak. She is reminiscent of the charismatic Nichelle Nichols. The science officer is very tall and creepy looking! The graphics and set decoration are quite good but we have now come to expect that these days on TV and movies. The Orville has more character and heart and it is free on broadcast TV, albeit it will be seen mostly via cable and satellite dish services. Let U.S. Netflix run it, please. The opener was humorless like the first Star Trek movie!'"

"'Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw Kingsman: The Secret Service at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called Eggsy who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the interview -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. Kingsman is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn\'t like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I\'m not a big fan of violence, but I\'ll put up with it for something like The Godfather - -- not for this. Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays.'"
"To compare this Star Trek series to any previous one is extremely difficult because this new show is very little like any of the previous shows. Now, instead of a one hour story that occasionally lasted several episodes, the show is essentially one long story...much like a soap opera or movie serial. Because of that, it's a tough show to watch here and there and it demands your attention each episode...something some viewers would no doubt not like. Additionally, the show is much darker and after the first half of season one, there is NOTHING that even remotely looks like comedy or even light drama. No, it's oppressive, dark and dim. On the positive side, it IS great looking...with effects that look as good as movies. But, Star Trek purists will no doubt be offended because this series is supposed to take place a decade before the first series from 1966-1969....yet the effects and technology seem hundreds of years ahead! Overall, it's a real mixed bag and I still honestly don't know what I think about it. Hard to rate and perhaps I'll come back to this review after I see more of how the story unfolds.UPDATE: After finishing the first season, I found I didn't hate nor love the series BUT feel it's best not to try comparing it to other Trek shows...it's THAT different. Instead, just accept it for what it is....and you'll likely enjoy it more."
"For a light comedy, scrubs was good. However, it wasn't as funny and great as everyone claims. Maybe because the humour got old. The last seasons with the new setting and characters should not have been filmed at all, in addition. The bromance, however, was pretty good and the main character was interesting."
"Scrubs is a show with 4 main leads but really it's the overall ensemble that makes it the great show that it is.The leads were J.D., Turk, Carla and Elliot. But you also had The Janitor, Kelso, Cox, The Todd, Nurse Laverne, Jordan, Snoop Dogg Intern and Dr. Beardface which helped makes the show so great. The characters play off of each other perfectly. The series wasn't afraid to poke fun at its main characters, like J.D. always drinking his Appletinis.After so many serious hospital shows like ER, Chicago Hope, St. Elsewhere, Hawthorne(which were all great shows), it's still nice to see a doctor show that doesn't take itself so serious. Not to say they made the doctors out to be clowns since they still really cared about their patients and saving them but they brought along humor to lighten the load when need be."
"'Scrubs' was at the start a nice funny alternative to the more heavy medical shows like 'ER'. It made a star out of Zach Braff, and ran successfully for many series, without really ever setting the world alight.It was a modern comedy, so of course it's unfortunately a given that it's full of sex jokes and stupidity, but the charm of Braff and many other of the cast saves things slightly.The network knew it had a hit on its hands, so this show got milked until it was not funny It's a shame, because at its peak, this show was better than most."
"'Great combination of a sitcom with a more serious drama.

A little heavy on the drama sideSeason 2: 7 (about 7 viewings, 6/11/2021)\nfirst half is on par with season 1 but steps it up later in the seasonSeason 3: 7 (about 7 viewings, 11/27/19, 6/30/2021)\nSeason 4: 8 (about 7 viewings, 12/11/19, 7/15/2021)\nSeason 5: 9 (about 6 viewings 12/2019)\nSeason 6: 9 (about 6 viewings 12/26/19)\nSeason 7: 9 (about 5 viewings 12/29/19)\nSeason 8: 8\nfinished the series like a beast (about 4 viewings 1/1/20)Season 9: 6\nnot nearly as good, mostly because of an unfunny lead actor, probably not her fault, just miscast. Some of the jokes were bad with a significant downgrade in writing. But there are lots of very funny characters and funny parts, especially with the old actors. Dave franco is hilarious in this role. And i liked mahone and drew (about 4 viewings 1/27/2020)'"
"'I must admit I\'m more into the DC Universe than the Marvel one and know nothing of the Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. comic, assuming there is one. Worse, I\'ve not even seen Avengers Assemble, so I guess I\'m not best qualified to review this highly publicised TV spin-off.However, taking it at face value, this was typical fast-moving American entertainment, even if it was pretty obviously not aimed at my demographic, I\'d wager. This episode sought to introduce the major characters who will appear regularly and even if, for the reasons stated above, the personnel and their back-stories lost me somewhat, the main story got through.With flashy, high-tech graphics, fine special effects, especially when Agent Coulson\'s car makes out like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang at the end and an easy to follow story, I was well- entertained in the fairly shallow way I expected. Sure some of the dialogue should have been screened extensively by the clichÃ©-cops and everyone\'s either being sarcastic or witty (they think), but there are some decent one-liners in there as you\'d hope.On the whole then, it\'s probably a bit too fast, flashy and loud for taste, but then again I\'m not much interested in comics from before 1980, so this was always gong to be a slightly awkward fit for me, but as trashy, disposable TV it\'s okay and I\'m confident that a major story-line will develop, as indeed I hope the rather large cast of characters do too.'"

"Was I looking forward to pick in on a series about the superheroes of Marvel, that's what I thought to see and that's exactly what they told me. Seeing trailers and interviews and seen that the director was already involved in full features about the superheroes I was ready to watch episode one.And after seeing episode one this series looked great. This I wanted to follow until the pilot was done and we moved further into the real world of SHIELD. And from that moment things went totally wrong for me. We moved 100% away from the superheroes. And after 6 episodes I was disgusted by the series. From an excellent opening it turned into a childish series that even looked fine for teenagers. There's nothing happening at all. Well, there is, the opening something happening and once the agents comes in it's full of clichÃ©s. The boss coming up for his crew, the sexy looking infiltrated chick, the nerdie chick, the freak, the yawn, macho man and...zzzzzzzzz.The effects used are rather good but I admit, after episode 6 I closed the door. Nothing 'marvel'ous here to see. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"
"'Review of Season One:I come to AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. somewhat late, having spent the past few years instead acquainting myself with the various DC Universe shows such as ARROW and SUPERGIRL. The good news is that AGENTS is every bit their equal, as long as you take the show on its own qualities. Attempts to link it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe are spurious at best and cameos from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson a bit distracting. However, the main characters are interesting and have enough depth to make this work. I was delighted by the appearance of Bill Paxton in this season, while the suspense levels are high enough to have you tuning in for more.'"
"'After 2 seasons i started to watch the show on 2x speed, because it became a little boring. but the show is easely digestable so i completet the whole 4 seasons. i wasnt really into the whole romcom thing, i seldom am. and the whole philosofy smuck wasnt all that present in detail. so in the end it was a somewhat wholesome romcom that made me laught in rare occation.6/10: eh its fine'"
"'At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what\'s funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I\'ll just say colorful sprinkle, you\'ll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this getting out of hand, being unrealistic/over the top.But that\'s it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it\'s always on some other level flying around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don\'t mind this being British to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you\'ll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing'"
"'It\'s funny at first but focuses on story pretty quickly, and the funny turns into fun.The characters are alright, they\'re fun and (intentionally) diverse, the actors are good but the acting is too Hollywoody and cued. Other series pull off a more genuine atmosphere. In a sense it\'s practically more of a (very long) play.\nSpecial mention out to Ted Danson (Michael) in particular who\'s absolutely seamless. Very underrated actor. And Janet is quite a creative, talented actress; and the character certainly one of the best elements here and adds a lot to the comedy and quality of the show.The series does well early on seizing the attention of the viewer as it unpacks its roller-coaster of a tale with seemingly endless twists and surprises. Ironically, the twist-laden first couple of seasons seem to stuff the viewer to the point where nothing seems surprising or unexpected anymore, and it could be said the first couple of seasons defeat the last couple of seasons at that. The end seems a bit nihilistic all in all, and somehow, that doesn\'t come as a surprise given the everything goes tone of the series.The subtext is appreciable at times, but the socio-political/religious implications certainly less. Why can\'t shows just be fun and tell a good story without underlying socio-politically tainted commentary ?'"
"'After 2 seasons i started to watch the show on 2x speed, because it became a little boring. but the show is easely digestable so i completet the whole 4 seasons. i wasnt really into the whole romcom thing, i seldom am. and the whole philosofy smuck wasnt all that present in detail. so in the end it was a somewhat wholesome romcom that made me laught in rare occation.6/10: eh its fine'"
'Season 1: 7/10\npretty creative and pretty funny. kept me invested throughout (1 viewing)Season 2: 6/10 (1 viewing)Season 3: 4/10\nbarely funny except for jason. feels tired and repetitive. i quit (1 viewing)'
"'Blood is a gory, Fantasy genre romp with a strong supporting cast. BEWARE NO CHILDREN THIS SHOULD BE RATED XXX. LOTS OF FOUL LANGUAGE. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 01/02/2021'"
"I gave this three seasons.It started out OK, in the first episode it looked like we had a strong heroine. That ended with the start of the second episode.From episode two on through the end of the third season the plot line falls back to the old damsel in distress clichÃ©. Sookie gets in trouble, Bill &/or Sam rushes to save here. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat.But there's more. Every character is a cry baby. Even the villains. It's a series written for the emo crowd. It appeals to One specific part of the American culture: You know that one guy at the party, that guy in the skinny jeans, with the effeminate hair-cut that guy that for some unknown reason has an emotional melt down & crumbles into the fetal position to cry his eyes out while everyone else is having a good time.Yeah. The show is written for that guy. For that crowd.Don't be part of the crowd.Pick up the remote control & change the channel before the show gets into your psyche & you start crying over spilled milk."
"'everything what you desires is present in this bizarre, provocative, eccentric series. the love, the hate, the friendship, the revenge, the sentimental complications, magic, vampires, atmosphere of South , lovely characters, dark demons, shocking events, romanticism and essence of Gothic stories. each as ingredient of a total show. because it is more than a cult series or media phenomenon. it has the virtue to be a kind of mirror. for dark side of viewers. for discover of new and interesting actors. for the science of detail and status of time trip. and, sure, for the art to transform a trend in refined manner.'"
"'I love vampire movies and series, I really liked true blood when it was on, for me season one was fun but not the best season for me, season two was a improvement, season three was great, season four was good but a step down, season five is my favourite season actually, I loved bill turning dark and losing his way, him and Eric working together was great, season six was mainly good, I loved them bringing back human vs vampires, season seven I liked it. It had good moments the only bug problem was honestly there was not credible big bad, true blood is a fun ride with blood gore sex horror campy comedic moments all rolled into one and is a once in a life viewing, one of the best shows HBO ever produced'"
"I really didn't expect to love this series as I'm not really a fan of legal dramas. It exceeded my expectations.First of all, the acting is amazing. Of course Viola Davis is phenomenal (as always), and some of the others were great as well, and some of them were just right. Characters are interesting but some are unlikeable. Wes is annoying (sorry), and so is Connor's boyfriend. Story is fast-paced and always interesting, and there's always a surprising twist in every episode. The thing is, it did not bore me. It got me hooked and excited, this series. Very few stories/series can manage to surprise or shock me, but this one did in almost every episode. Waiting for Season 5."
"A little over-dramatic with a cast of characters I hoped would became more relatable and endearing as time went on. Unfortunately, I did not find it to be the case forever clutching at straws to find a redeemable trait about the characters.That fact I made it to Season 3, was probably on a train wreck/car crash scenario where I couldn't help but watch intently. The constant flashback based around that particular season's main narrative became formulaic by the third season.Great for escapism, if you're into that sort of thing."
"'For me, its basic virtue remains to discover Viola Davis. and to admire her impecable performance. to see the labyrinth of a murder and the pressure and a story without real heroes. her force to define the lead character is the best motif to see the serie.'"
"'The Kingsmen is a long standing international secret service operation. It is fashioned after the Knights of the Round Table. It utilizes gadgets that one might find in a James Bond Film or even MIB. They are over-the-top as they spoof spy films. When an agent is killed, they seek recruits to replace him. As young adults compete for the honor, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp) conspires to save the world from Global Warming. His side kick is a woman (Sofia Boutella) with knives as lower limbs. Together they spoof the super villains in films. Our group ironically must stop Valentine from saving the world so it can die later.This was a funny film with plenty of action and exploding heads. Diabolically clever satire.Guide: F-word. No sex. Butt nudity at end of film.'"
"'How to Get Away with Murder tells the story of a group of aspiring law students whose lifes balance out of control when a dead girl and a missing girlfriend seem to be linked to their professor\'s husband, resulting in a murder with widespread consequences.This series really keeps you gasping. It develops from what seems to be a steady scheme in the first season into something much bigger and darker that gives you little chance to see through events in advance. There are times when it feels like producers couls lose you but until now they always managed to come up with new plot lines that increase the suspense again and appear realistic enough to not be ridiculous. Even when I agree that a few seasons less would have been no harm, this should still be a role model for many shows because the level of suspense it builds and keeps up is enormous. What in other shows would be a great cliff hanger is here just another turn within an episode.All in all this is definitely worth a watch. It\'s not the most realistic series ever and emotionally exhausting at times but definitely keeps you thrilled and searching for answers.'"
"'This to me has all the suffering so wonderfully dramatised by The Missing with all the driven energy of the detective side of shows such as Prime Suspect or The Tunnel. This is a truly riveting show, brilliantly acted, highly photogenic, and displaying all the professionalism and angst from the investigative side seamlessly contrasted with all heartache and tension of those around the identity of the killer, and the cold ice star of the killer himself.'"
"Sure, there are some coincidences here and there that feel a little too contrived (for instance: what are the odds of Paul taking so much time in Stella's hotel room Ã¡nd Jim coming by that very night?), but the big pluses of this series make me very forgiving.I loved the dark atmosphere of the whole (a fierce serial killer who pretends to be a good father played very well by Jamie Dornan^, good 'old' Gillian Anderson as a somewhat troubled investigator, Belfast itself), even when the first season seemed a little more intense than the second. As far as all the issues that were addressed go, 'The fall' takes on a whole lot, but never strays too far from the main story.It's been a while since a TV-series drew me in like this one did, and I'm really looking forward to a new season, Ã¡nd watching the first two again not before long!9 out of 10.^ Didn't know he also did the lead in 'FiShOGr', but there it is..."
"'one of series who are, in profound sense, special. or different. or unexpected. or great. or surprising. because it is not exactly the crime series who could be familiar. it is not the psychological drama who propose mysteries and solutions and brave heroes. it is a gray story about ordinary people, in a Belfast who has the chance to be any town. a precise picture, almost too neutral, about vulnerable people, about a case and about a hunt with double sense. and this small facts transforms it in a admirable work. because it has the chance to be a trip among cold slices of reality.'"
"It's not necessary to ask the actors do the straight, gay or lesbian love-making, intercourse scenes, totally unnecessary. Viewers who appreciated this series don't actually needed those stuff. Asking these actors doing these unnecessary love-making scenes was not kind to them, 'cause it's the on-going interviews of the extremely violent, vicious, twisted-minded serial killers and the gradual development of the profiling science of the FBI that interested us, not the licking, grinding, kissing love-making sexual scenes between the straight or the lesbian persons motivated us to watch this series.The 2nd season spent too much episodes on the Atlanta serial killing investigation, I was a bit getting tired of these episodes. I also sympathize the actors who in order to show how people chain-smoking in the 60s, 70s and 80s, they had to smoke so many cigarettes in every episode, hope them won't get lung cancers after this drama series. Those who did the supporting roles in all the episodes, either smoking or inhaling the 2nd handed cigarette smoke in the restaurants, all the public places, in the airplane cabins, Jesus, what a disgust and shameful scene to watch.All the actors did superb fantastic acting jobs, salute! The scenes of 70s, the settings just looked so real, absolutely impeccable. This is a very serious and honest production, I salute to all of the people and praise them did a great job. Awaiting and craving the 3rd Season. I'm a fan."
"'Sometimes you watch a show, just to check it out and see what it\'s about and discover all these great things about it. I came across Mindhunter, a friend recommended it to me, he suggested I gave it a try and so I did, and I have to say this is some of the most amazing things I\'ve seen. It\'s not just a show it\'s an episodic movie, placed in many chapters and sequences with very intricate character development and incredibly well acted, well produced and well written. The biographical elements are woven into it\'s rich fictional plot and made to seem as accurate as possible. The way the serial killers\' minds work, the whole show is about that basically, it\'s a personification of these sequence killers as it was known back then, it\'s brilliant, kitschy and very very intense. David Fincher really created a masterpiece here and this is practically an addition to the plethora of reasons why 21st century Fincher is a tier ahead of the 20th century Fincher, he\'s exploring different mediums and that is a really good way to tell more stories in different ways with very well developed cores and characters with as much experimentation that he can do with his limited script.'"
"I'm beyond fascinated by the study of the criminals as weird as they may sound so this hit the spot to me kinda like a delicious meal! The other thing is David Fincher the director of the pilot is one of my all time favorite humans/famous beings! Mindhunter has a wonderful tranquil ambient soundtrack throughout and immersive acting. It'll creep you out, intrigue you, and even make you wanna sympathize with many of the characters.Also I'm rewatching for the second time, I originally saw when back in its prime and loving every bit again, I'm sure season 2 is just as good; I'll watch that soon. They're needs to be a lot more adult crime shows rated TV-MA, it's a million times better than most! Highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind learning about monsters that did sinister crimes!"
"Clever, hilarious comedy.A behind-the-scenes look at the the cast and crew of The Girly Show (TGS), an NBC skit-comedy program. Centres on the executive producer of the show, Liz Lemmon (played by Tina Fey), her boss, GE/NBC executive Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin).Created by Tina Fey, of SNL fame, 30 Rock is incredibly clever, especially in its references to topical events and in poking fun at the entertainment industry. Quite over-the-top at times, and delightfully so. The jokes come thick and fast, sometimes too fast - you've hardly digested one and the next one is upon you. If there is a negative, that is it - with the humour being so clever, you need some breathing space to sometimes get the jokes and being so snappy, you can easily miss things.Great performances and perfect casting. Alec Baldwin probably has the toughest gig, as his character is right-wing and capitalist to the extreme and is a living parody of not just the entertainment industry but business executives in general. Also, before this Baldwin was really considered only a drama-movie actor, so this is quite a change for him. He carries it off with aplomb.A classic and classy comedy series."
"30 Rock is a show that you either love or hate. The comedy is very subjective and has stayed true to it's own style for all 7 seasons. I initially thought it was a bit ridiculous and rather childish but then it started to grow on me. Now I officially count myself in the love category. I'm very impressed with Tiny Fey, she truly is very talented and I commend her for creating a show that is unashamed to be funny, intelligent and stupid all at the same time.Now that I am finally in the seventh season I think they made the right decision to go out on a high before the show had a chance to become too old and tired. If you still haven't watched any of the episodes then it is never too late. You may be pleasantly surprised and end up binge watching until the very last episode like I did. I highly recommend it."
"I have heard a lot of great things about this show, that it is one of the best laugh out loud comedies out there and so on and so forth..... I have never been more disappointed...I thought season 1 was a bit slow like The Office or Parks and Recreations and I held on until season 2 and 3 but after watching 3 episodes in season 3 i could not suffer it any more. I have tried really hard to like this but I didn't even SMILE once, I am not even talking about laughing, I couldn't even force a smile because of how bad it is. This is by far the most overrated show in the history of TV shows and I have watched around 80 different ones"
'Awesome Korean movie. I like the bit where he cut his tongue off'
"'It is a serie about yourself. Episode by episode. The animation, the dialogues, the characters are far be sugar drops. But this is the basic virtue of a serie defining, in profound-precise manner, the traits of contemporary world. It is a film about Hollywoo but, in the same measure, it is a good serie about the deep loneliness of us, far by excuses or surrogates. The result is not comfortable but it is so easy to understand than BJack is just yourself.'"
"'Five seasons in, BoJack Horseman continues to be one of the most complex, thought-provoking and funny animated shows.Season five revolves around BoJack\'s (Will Arnett) new crime show Philbert, and blossoming relationship with co-star Gina (Brooklyn Nine-Nine\'s Stephanie Beatriz). Meanwhile, Princess Carolyn (Amy Sedaris) juggles a busy producing career and the prospect of becoming a new mother, there\'s the fallout from Diane (Alison Brie) and Mr. Peanutbutter\'s divorce, and Todd (the always amazing Aaron Paul) somehow becomes CEO of a big corporation - before being superseded by his home-made sex robot Henry Fondle (whose pre-programmed phrases provides the answers that his employees want). In an often heavy show, Todd\'s levity and crazy hijinks provide vital balance as well as the clever sight gags that\'s become a tradition.The highlight of season five is \'Free Churro\'; it\'s a 25-minute monologue by BoJack at his mother\'s funeral. In these 25 minutes, BoJack\'s complex relationship with his mother unravels, from her final words to him and the random act of kindness to BoJack from a fast food employee. Watching one person talk for 25 minutes flies against the short attention span of most viewers, but it works and Arnett should get some sort of award for it.\nWhile season five continues to expose BoJack\'s many flaws (and constant self-loathing), it ends on an optimistic note, thanks to some help from Diane.A must-watch for BoJack fans.'"
"'Hey Guys RegularShow1 here again and today I\'m going to review the Netflix Original series BoJack Horseman. The show is about a TV star named Bojack Horseman who used to be on a sitcom on TV called Horsin\' Around. But Today he is a washed up celebrity from 1990s live Hollywood, CA with Todd Chavez who is a slacker that ends up living with Bojack. Then there Diane Nuguyen who is a ghostwriter for Bojack. The show is satire on Hollywood. The show started streaming on Netflix on August 22,2014 with it second season on July 17,2015.I recently started watching it and like it. Anyway I highly recommend this show. Anyway I\'m giving Bojack Horseman a 10 out of 10 stars. See You Later. BYE.'"
'I first watched this show because i wanted to laugh and I thought this is the show needed. But it wanst. There is some scenes that will make you laugh but in general this show is so deep and is makes me sad.\nPlease if you are a suicidal person dont watch this show.'
"'I am long over anthropomorphised animal people and watching their lives on candid camera.The situations and premise just seem rehashed from numerous older shows, and the shows pacing just seems forced to either make people deal with something they didnt need to in an unamusing way, or just waste time with blow hard tactics aimed at making people feel empathy with the characters. BUT IT DOESNT WORK!\nI just felt nothing withthe show, and after watching episodes 1-5 with some friends baout 4 years ago, I never went back. At least the shows finally over, so that something good might fill the airways ( fat chance, entertainment in most forms has been dead for years lol) . Oh well. 5/10 show at best.'"
"'This show is absolutely great. The pilot episode is not the best in the series, so don\'t let that stop you. This show is full of jokes, puns, whit and nostalgia for anyone in their 30s to 50s to enjoy. James and Dule play very well off each other and the entire cast has great chemistry. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is a fan of sitcoms as well as crime dramas.\nThis show centers around Shawn Spencer, a man in his mid to late twenties that has issues holding down a job. His dad, a retired detective for the Santa Barbara police department had trained Shawn as a kid to be hyper observant. Shawn had been using this ability to help police solve crimes by phoning in tips. In the pilot episode this ends up having Shawn pulled in for questioning. In a panic, he tells the police he is psychic. They test this claim out and he uses his powers of observation to solve a crime, and he opens a detective agency with his childhood friend Burton Gus Guster. Unfortunately the show only lasted 8 seasons. It is definitely in my top ten favorite shows. Be sure to check out Psych the musical!!!'"

"'Some of the best TV I\'ve seen in quite a while. I may like this even better than Monk, and I like Monk quite a bit.Shawn constantly flips out pop cultural references from well before his time. He must have spent a good portion of his youth watching every possible rerun. LOL Catching and figuring them all out can be a pretty good game for the viewer all by itself.I truly think that the USA Network is consistently putting out the best new programming around. This is a pleasant contrast to the Sci-Fi Network, which is doing its best to buy up and budget kill anything that threatens to be good sci-fi.The three series from USA that we watch religiously (Psych, Monk, and Burn Notice) is a larger count than the combined shows we watch from the original big 3 .... combined.Keep up the good work, USA, and we\'ll keep watching!'"

"'I never liked Monk very much. But from the instant this show came on right after it, I knew USA finally had something. This has to be one of the best shows ever made-- if not, then definitely one of the top comedies. It combines dramedy, mystery, the buddy dynamic, and pineapples. It\'s got lots of witty references, from Airwolf to Smokey & the Bandit, and it features two main characters (Shawn, played by James Roday, and Gus, played by Dule Hill) who make a great duo all-around, from their great chemistry to their playful A-B Club ethics. Corbin Bernsen shakes things up as Shawn\'s tough-as-nails ex-cop dad. Kirsten Nelson deserves some sort of Emmy for her take on police chief Karen Vick. And as the anti-Shawn-and-Gus, Timothy Omundson and Maggie Lawson are fantastic (Lawson was a replacement after the pilot episode for the equally phenomenal Anne Dudek, who played a woman named Precious in an episode of Friends). This show has it all-- the humor is spot-on, the mysteries just keep improving with age, and I think we\'ll always be drawn to a show about a slacker with a heart of gold... and fake psychic abilities.'"
"'I haven\'t read the Manga (comic) this is based on, but I can tell you that the movie is very devastating. It also features things that might not be as apparent as they are, especially to western audience members. There is a different sense of honor and sensibility in general, something that is difficult to translate (more on that on my review for the US remake).The lead role is played by great gusto, but the villain of the piece is great too. You can argue about motives all you want and about character decisions (see sensibility and how this movie ends), but it all works out nice. There are quite a few remarkable things happening (especially visually - think octopus and Hammer time to name a couple - but also tonally or story wise - one very big twist, that is as twisted as it gets) and some will take you by surprise. Unless you have read about them or seen the remake before this. Would be a shame, because if you only watch one Oldboy, make it this one!'"
"'The title is a metaphor to describe the relationship between the rich and the poor. It is a social statement. We are first introduced to the poor Kim family who is street smart. They steal wi-fi and put together pizza boxes. Kevin (Woo-sik Choi ) is introduced to the rich gullible Kim family as an English tutor. He manages through lies to get the rest of his family hired on as the old servants are dismissed. We discover poor people have a disgusting smell to them. They smell like the subway (urine?) The film climaxes ar a birthday party.The film was mildly amusing and clever. It wasn\'t as funny or entertaining as say, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. While good, I would say the Oscar as best picture was a gift.Guide: F-word. groping. no nudity.'"
"'Interestingly, the idea for the movie that led to the creation of this show is a stone tablet called the Byblos Calligary discovered in 1928 that shows a still unidentified language that predates, some think, the earliest examples of written language on Earth. Very interesting. That the show is a blatant nod to the military, is just plain depressing. Just more SF flap doodle that really goes nowhere except to generate more shows in a similar vein that are equally unwatchable for anyone with half a mind. That gotta hurt. Really, I think it is bad SF. All bad SF has a combination of three elements, an unexplained artifact, followed by teams of military people followed by perplexed aliens fighting the previously mentioned military persons.Nothing new there, and nothing new here, except that they have been doing it unflaggingly for years now to the point the old bad has become the new good. For that, it deserves a Brooklyn Cheer. This show and its spin offs deserve to go the way of Space 1999, and UFO, both truly bad SF shows that were put out of their misery long ago, to the benefit of all.'"
'Pure gold. Such a fabulous product to watch. I enjoyed the space adventure and scify that it provided for me.'
"Showtime, with its addition of Outer Limits and Total Recall - the Series, has done more for original s.f. programming than the Sci Fi Channel. However, Showtime's crowning achievement is Stargate SG-1, a well-developed s.f. series that takes an okay movie and takes it much further.  The characters are well-rounded, various aspects of their galactic travel are explored, there is a wide range of continuing plotlines and costarring characters.  After a somewhat rocky start in the first half of the first season, as they hit all of the standard s.f. cliches (a character ages, they visit a parallel universe, they land on a planet where the female character must combat anti-feminism), they've broadened quite a bit, expanding the backstory of the Stargate itself, the enemy (the Gou'ald), and Earth's role to come.  Highly entertaining, with great performances by Richard Dean Anderson and Christopher Judge in particular.  Catch it now that it's in syndication, if you don't get Showtime."
"The 1990's was a mediocre time for sci-fi series in my opinion. Stargate SG-1 was one of the few good series.Like so many good shows what helped Stargate SG-1 was it's awesome cast; Richard Dean Anderson as Col. O' Neill, Amanda Tapping as Captain/Major Carter, Michael Shanks as Dr. Jackson, Don S. Davis as Major General Hammond and Christopher Judge as Teal'c.All the characters are brilliant. The chemistry between them is great. Some of the Stargate SG-1 plots have been a little bit weak but you wouldn't notice because of the brilliant cast. The SG-1 team kind of remind me of The A-Team from the 80's because they stick together, they're good friends outside work and they always do the right things.The villains in this series could rival many of the villains from Star Trek. We have had the SG-1 team fighting the likes of the G'ouald and the replicators. The storylines have been consistently good throughout.All in all, this is a good series. My only criticism is the fact that the talented Teryl Rothery who plays Dr. Frasier hasn't had any good storylines of her own."
"'The series lives from its fantastic leading actress. She exudes incredible energy and plays the role of the naive and abandoned family mother of the 50s, who wants to become a comedian, in a unique freshness and brilliance. The series looks almost like a play. This is not least due to the often long and very pointed dialogues, which despite all the tragedy always make you laugh - but also because of the good camera. It captures the New York of that time again and again in a single shot per scene, and is thus right in the middle. The costumes, music and cut are just wonderful. With eight episodes for the first season, a wonderfully successful and short-breathed intermezzo.'"
"This is one of the best, if not the best, TV shows appearing in the last 5 years and the entire credit belongs to AS-P. It's one of the very few show that I can sit absolutely hypnotized for hours on end. The only thing I would cut out are some of Shy's singing. It gets a little tedious at times. Otherwise it is Grade A perfect."

"I watched all of season 1, but season 2 was not so interesting and I failed to watch all episodes. But now, 2019 in season 3, I am hooked again. It is 1960 and Midge is branching out to do shows outside of Manhattan, and even goes to Vegas to work with a more well-known entertainer, a fictional singer, Shy Baldwin.I watch the show because Rachel Brosnahan is so good as Mrs. Maisel, 'Midge'. She is far from perfect, she gets divorced and doesn't seem to care much what happens to her two kids, often being cared for by the grandparents who have their own issues. I really like Tony Shalhoub as her dad, Professor Abe Weissman.Also really good is Alex Borstein as short, spineless Susie Myerson, a friend who serves as her manager, rarely taking a strong stand on anything but needs the 10% she gets from her clients. She has a very funny style about her, her character is a goofball in a very nice way. But I also must say her overly dirty mouth gets tiresome quickly.The late-1950s, early 1960s is done very well, that was the period when I was a teenager so it brings back good memories of a simpler time."
"Captivating well deserving of the awards it's earned! Poignant delight and heartwarming constantly! Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Borstein are lovely; Rachel is gorgeous I love her. I bet Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is quite a feat to make in many aspects like the writing, set designs, clothing, and choreography. Very enjoyable I'm I decided to watch season 3."
"Sex and the City (1998-2004) is one of my absolute favorites for many reasons. First off, it sports an incredible cast! Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, Kim Cattrall plays Samantha Jones, Cynthia Nixon is Miranda Hobbes, and Kristin Davis plays Charlotte York. The casting is spot on, every actress plays their character perfectly. It's true that they're all a joy to watch, Samantha Jones is my personal favorite, she's truly hilarious and just when you think she can't think about anything other than casual sex, she surprises you with her big heart. I love that each character has their own style and they are so different as people, yet they fit together perfectly as a friend group. The writing is just great. It is full of witty, hilarious humor, touching moments between these well developed characters, and it's all pulled together by the great chemistry that hovers over the whole show. Another thing I love is how real the show is, especially about sex. All is revealed. The dialogue is uncensored and that works for the show. Overall, this is a very entertaining, well written show that I definitely suggest! 10/10."
"'I\'d never heard of Frank Abagnale Jr before Catch Me If You Can came out, but what a guy! Watching the movie, one really grows to admire him, partly because of Leonardo DiCaprio\'s cool portrayal. Abagnale forged checks and assumed a number of false identities during the \'60s. Tom Hanks is equally cool as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, doggedly searching the world for Abagnale. This isn\'t Steven Spielberg\'s best movie by any stretch, but it\'s sure a neat one. There is one scene that\'s probably there for comic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Also starring are Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Cool.'"
"I watched about 2 or 3 shows and a few bits and pieces of other shows. As the rappers say don't believe the hype. Funny in spots, and the acting is OK. The show loses my attention span very quickly. I find the show a little too close for real life. Sex in the city make this viewer happy he is married. The moral or thesis of the show is the female characters are too self-absorbed with their own feeling, jobs etc they leave no room for a real relationship. Throwing oneself sexually is never going create a healthy longterm relationship. I believe the show either displays the selfish silliness or that the characters really do not want a man. Either way I find the characters too hollow to watch for a long time. They do not even treat each other too well with some of the games they play on each other. 5 out of 10. Some buddy please help these people."
"I like the striking production values, the music which is infectious and somewhat sexy and the acting of Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral and Chris Noth. Otherwise, I am not a fan of this show. I find the characters shallow especially at the start, the writing clichÃ©d and unfunny with the over-analysis on relationships often making me cringe and the stories predictable and uneven in pace-often on the dull side.Overall, I can understand both sides. I can understand why those may find it addictive, but I can also understand why people find it shallow. I'm not a fan, as much as I did try to like it. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"'the truth. about sex relations, friendship, women and men, business, gossips, feelings, fears, pain and hope, children, strangers, first meet, age and sickness. and, about honesty. and this mix does the success of a series who has the science to give the right speech about facts and details who are ignored by film industry in the direct manner. result - memorable characters, charming manner to present everyday facts. and the flavor of a city, the spice of Brasil, the links who define friendship. this is the series who could be the best choice for fans of chick-lit and magazines. but, after the first superficial verdicts , it is not complicated to define Sex and the City as a wise exercise , almost admirable, exercise of honesty.'"
"Gotham is basically a 5 year flashback of Bruce becoming the boring iconic hero known as batman.His parents die, Bruce is depressed and rich and he fight bad guys. I already know this and don't care.Oh and its dark."
"'A crime drama about the rise (and falls) of Detective James Gordon in the years while Bruce Wayne grows into Batman, told in parallel from the angle of Gordon himself, from the angle of young Wayne, as well as from the angles of important players of the Gotham underworld.Initially a combination of gangster and buddy-cop genres, as convincing and realistic as possible for the DC universe, the series later grows into an SF superhero (or supervillain, as they are in majority and much more fun) madness with countless plots and subplots. However, although it may be a bit over-the-top, the series does not lose its direction and not a single ark remains incomplete.The complex multi-layered story, which does not get lost in its complexity, brings us the origins stories of Penguin, Riddler, Joker, Catwoman, and many other well-known characters of the Batman universe, and introduces some new, equally good ones. The strongest asset of the series is the great variety of compelling characters with excellent characterization (no black-and-white division between good and evil) and the evolution of their relationships. The cast is top-notch, and I especially have to single out the wicked and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith, the best Penguin ever played by Robin Lord Taylor, Cory Michael Smith as Riddler, and Cameron Monaghan as the Joker whose creepiness is unlikely to ever be matched, let alone exceeded.8/10.'"
"I had originally given this show a 10/10 and have not missed an episode since day one.Everything about this show started out perfect - directing, writing, cinematography, sfx, acting, etc.My problem now is that the writing has been getting sloppy. You start getting to know certain characters, they become integral in the plot, then you don't see them for (+/-) half the season. What's worse is that from where they left off and when they come back, there's no explanation for the missing timeline. E.g. Erin Richards' character and especially Jada Pinkett Smith's character. We see Fish Money at the end of a season finale and then vanishes the next.For that reason I've dropped my score to a 9/10. I really hope the sloppy writing improves again."
"I have watched about two episodes of Gotham and it is just loud. When I mean loud I mean just unnecessarily screaming, shouting or just random yelling. Or sometimes just overacting when it is not needed.Like in the first episode I got put off straight away when the episode began and Bruce's parents get shot then for some reason Bruce just shrieks so loudly like I have to turn my volume down to 10%. But I carried on for the whole episode. I have to say though the actor for Jim Gordan is good considering he voiced Batman in an animated movie Batman year one which wasn't even that good. But I have to admit the actress for Barabra is hot. But don't waste your time with this is you have hearing problems or instant heart attack problems just stay away from it because there are lots of unnecessary over acting, shouting and yelling in this show."
"There are so many ways this could've gone totally wrong but this series is handled with seriousness and poignancy. Moreover the prison is full of rich, diverse characters with faces that the movie experts do recognize---Natasha Lyonne, Kate Mulgrew, Taryn Manning--- but most of them won't be recognized and recognizable, which is fine, because there's not a single Mischa Barton in this giant ensemble. These 13 episode are often quotable, very funny, occasionally violent and completely engrossing. Overall a perfect series, combining humor, drama and a bit of violence as well."
"The story of Piper Chapman, a woman in her thirties who is sentenced to fifteen months in prison after being convicted of a decade-old crime of transporting money for her drug-dealing girlfriend. The writing is meant to make us all laugh and succeeds. This movie has gotten me through some dark times. You could say that the film is built on a firm base. The acting is very effective. This film was nearly perfect, but sadly still not made for everyone. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It's meant to be goofy. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose. Hooray!"
"'Season 1: 4\nintriguing and i wanted to see what happens but i skipped a lot of parts and watched it on fast speed (1 viewing)Season 2: 6\nmuch better, story moves faster. the last episode was awesome (1 viewing)Season 3: 6\nstill skipping some scenes and watching fast mostly, but the story is good and i love stella (1 viewing)Season 4: 6 (1 viewing)\nSeason 5: 7 (1 viewing)\nSeason 6: 3\ni was in the middle of the 6th episode, watching everything in fast speed and getting almost no enjoyment out of it, when i thought to myself, why am i still watching this garbage? so i stopped (1 viewing)'"

"I'm not entirely finished with the second season, but it doesn't matter as of now. The show's incredibly consistent, totally and utterly entertaining and so easily watchable. The ensemble is amazing, possibly one of TV's finest ever, and the series does a great mix between both comedy and drama. The character development is aces, and it never ceases to surprise you with the character turns and developments. Taylor Schilling is wonderful in the title role, and even better in the second season. This is strongly recommended, and as of now Netflix's best show, surpassing House of Cards. It has tighter writing and a better handle on the story lines."
"Unlike the other Marvel/Netflix shows, The Punisher doesn't suffer from too much filler, or glacial pacing. It moves and Jon Berenthal dominates the screen. Yes it is violent. Yes he is revenge driven. But he has a reason and the reason is always clear. The supporting cast is very good, and for those who care, very diversified. The man who betrays him and who Frank turns into Jigsaw is a worthy adversary. But in the end, the show is propelled by Berenthal, who also overshadowed the second season of Daredevil."
"The Punisher is a fresh and entertaining show. For those who love violence, hand to hand combat and realism this show is for you. The Punisher has a somewhat slow start in that it gives you a loose picture of what the story is driven by and what Frank Castle is driven by. In the first few minutes you see him take revenge on those people who killed his family. The show looks at the wider conspiracy as to why they were murdered. The conspiracy is pulled off well and the cast deliver some solid performances. Jon Bernthal was born for this role and pulls it off with ease. The only criticism is the one dimensional nature of the show with Frank and the rest of the cast. There is no irony, poetic justice and depth beyond the 'eye for an eye' story which could have taken it to new heights but this is that bit extra that I personally might have liked. But nevertheless it doesn't reduce the quality or intensity of the show and it still makes for excellent viewing. Highly recommended, I can't wait for season 2. \n8/10"
"'What a cracking series. Super violent, heroic, and honorable. In the vein of Old Boy and other great Asian crime flicks. Honestly one of the few Hollywood attempts that can match the best Chinese, Japanese and Korean products.Rollicking great fun and yet, amidst all the over the top violence, gore and general mayhem, the creators have still managed to piece together a strong storyline, compelling characters and perhaps even an empathy with the baddies.Definitely not to be missed if you like the Hong Kong crime and gang genre.'"
'Have just watched the first season of this sci fi show as much as I found it interesting it is a little predictable and along the lines of the X files each episode a different story but with the underlined theory they are all connected to a bigger picture that will unravel as the seasons progress. Not gripping but easy to watch so scores a 6 from me may change if future seasons improve?'
"'A nuclear bomb in Los Angeles, WWIII looming on the horizon, and it all comes down to one man, Jack Bauer (Sutherland), to save the day. Although a bit more contrived than season one, the second season of 24 follows the same formula as the first season with 24 virtual hours (16 viewer hours) jam packed with twisty-turny crisscrossing subplots, suspense, action, drama, and, of course, those countless looks askance. If you haven\'t seen this incredibly popular Emmy winning series, rent the first DVD in the first season first and see if you don\'t suddenly find yourself a 24 junkie lusting for more. A little something for everyone 13 and up. (B)'"
"This is a suspenseful show and it's great.  I saw season 2 then 3 and I am in the middle of season 1.  I think the first season so far is the best. The third is the worst.  The actors are great the the lady who is Neena myers is a hottie.  I hope that there are more seasons to come and I hope that one day, we have a president exactly like David Palmer. Sure, he's African American, but he's the real deal.  There is nobody as good as Palmer and everybody knows it.  Keiffer Sutherland has found his true calling. That is Jack Bower.  Mr. Bower gets in the worst situations and it a lot more tough than even Jack Ryan.  Yes, you heard me right, he is toughger than JACK RYAN!!!Kudos!~"
"24 doesn't need a review. It only needs viewers watching it. Just that.\nAfter that, episode by episode, season by season, you will feel like your mind, senses are wandering off. You will be feeling yourself detached and flown into the shows' world.No imperfection existed for me throughout, my focus was only to Kiefer Sutherland's voice, acting and the magnetism of the series. He was born to play Jack Bauer.You will be drawn into 24 like nothing you have touched and felt before. The experience will leave you shaken and in awe.\nYou will find yourself hungry, needy, sleepy, but unable to move from your seat.After 18 years, I still have fond memories of the show and sensations that no other series was able to duplicate.A diamond in the world of series and a very personal experience for me, which I will forever cherish and never forget."
"This is one of those series you hope they will never get canceled. All the actors are funny, the script must have been written when they were on something, it's hilarious. Each character plays his stereotype at his best. The whole Bluth family has some serious issues but they seem to function like that. My favorite characters are Tobias FÃ¼nke, Buster Bluth and George-MichaÃ«l Bluth even though I like all the other characters as well. The whole family is so messed up it's too funny for words. I was really surprised when they picked up the series again after seven years for another season and hoped it would have last longer. Everybody looked more or less the same except for Portia De Rossi that turned from a beautiful women to some strange creature which only proves that you should not mess with your looks and don't use plastic surgery. A must watch!"
"'I get it: the rich are evil. And not only evil, but also stupid. Sub-human if you come to think about it.'"
"Previously, Ryan Reynolds had portrayed Green Lantern, which I remember enjoying but I later found out others had not. Knowing that, I have to say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed him here as Deadpool, a wisecracking costumed hero from Marvel Comics who swears, kills, and is mainly after the guy who did something bad to him. He also has a fine-looking girl played by Morena Baccarin who seems a perfect match for him. This was quite a funny, action-packed movie we both enjoyed. The beginning credits were really funny and if you're familiar with a certain John Hughes movie, you really shouldn't miss the after credits scene...so that's a high recommendation of Deadpool."
"'This show was simply one of the best comedies that I\'ve seen . Form the first episode I was fascinated for the story ,the character and their (utterly hilarious ) conflicts . Using a visual technique that reminds me very much Dogma 95 Movies , Arrested Development  it\'s pure fun from beginning to end . I tried to find a single moment that wasn\'t funny ,but I couldn\'t .All the gags , verbal , physical or of any other kind were incredibly effective . It\'s so sad that it was canceled ! But even that ,I\'m glad that I\'ve the luck to see all the episodes . I\'m sure that this show will we remembered as a classic in the future years . Oustanding !'"

"One of those rare shows that have been popping up which uses a non-traditional presentation -- jiggly camera, frequent yet hilarious voice-overs from Ron Howard, bizarre sight gags, among other elements -- ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT became the big hit with critics and award shows alike even if the ratings were not the best, perhaps because of its time slot and competition with DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.In its short time on the air it's demonstrated that wackiness and eccentricity in a family pay off, especially when the writing is almost too good for its own good and the situations are so off the wall they actually, gleefully go over it. An ensemble cast that while initially may not say quality since many have had checkered careers in both films and television or are relative unknowns, nevertheless everyone without singling out any actor in particular is at their utmost, quirky best, the story lines are not only crazy to begin with but getting better by the edition, and the hopes that this show will not be prematurely canceled or moved into cable TV -- ARRESTED could fare excellently on HBO if FOX decided to axe it.Uncompromising and outrageously hysterical while at the same time smart and sharp, this is one show that should not be missed."
"Excellent film depicting the Atlantic City area during the beginning of Prohibition in 1920.Am wondering if Steve Buscemi will be up to playing suave gangster Nukki Thompson in this series.It appears that director Martin Scorsese and others associated with this production have all totally captured the period. The set decorations seem to be excellent.We see that Nukki can actually have a heart in his treatment of Mrs. Schroeder, of course the fact that he has had Mr. Schroeder killed is something else.The film is very interesting in that it takes us to the beginnings of the illustrious careers of Arnold Rothstein and Al Capone.Corruption is wide-spread throughout Atlantic City. Even Thompson addresses a meeting of the Lady's Temperance Society at the film's beginning.As this part ends, we see the linking of Atlantic City to Chicago for violating the Volstead Act. The film is immediately showing that the latter act was so much more trouble than what it was worth."
"'I gave this a chance until the second season when the slow moving action just ground to a halt midway through the season. The story seems to wander about aimlessly, flailing around to try and stop it from drowning. Each episode just seemed to be more and more like a theme park or elaborate costume set but without a very substantive story. I just could not connect with the characters like I did with The Sopranos where the characters really drew you into their story. In this series, the characters were like figures from history where you knew the names but they had no flesh to them at all. This, coupled with the slow moving story just lead to a complete loss of interest in the characters and the story. Steve Buscemi\'s portrayal did not fit the character at all, instead coming across like a caricature. He did not seem able to move through the range of emotions that would bring depth and credibility to the character. I think this series was hyped way beyond it\'s reality!'"
"If i remember right, an important detail in marketing Boardwalk Empire has been the involvement of Martin Scorcese and Mark Wahlberg as executive producers. There were others, but not as important as these two.Now, Scorcese's projects in the past decade or so ranged between barely watchable (Gangs of New York) over mediocre flicks (Wolf of Wall Street) to exciting dramas (Shutter Island, The Departed) and even nice documentaries (George Harrison: Living in the Material World). Judging by this track record, Boardwalk Empire could have been anywhere between a disaster and a masterpiece.Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, has been the man behind Entourage, one of the lamest TV shows i've seen. But i didn't want to be judgmental and gave Boardwalk Empire a try.Probably the most important thing is to understand that Boardwalk Empire successfully interweaves facts with fiction. Looking at the storyline, each season kicked off rather uneventful and roughly after the first half the writers changed gears and headed toward the finale. The series is laced with violence and a fair amount of gore and female nudity. It would be interesting to understand whether the viewers wanted to see those three or the producers decided that it would be good idea to focus on them.Needless to say, the hype surrounding Boardwalk Empire was very strong, although the product was mediocre."
"I've watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this series, and well, ummm, okay, it got kind of redundant after a while, didn't it? Much like the plot in a porno is just enough to string the sex scenes together, the plot in this movie is just to string the sex and violence scenes together.Spartacus is a Thracian betrayed by his Roman allies, and sent to a gladiator ludus. But most of the series isn't about him, it's about the machinations of the Ludus owner, Batiates, and his wife, Xena, Lesbian Princess. Or whatever. So all of this involves complicated plots leading up to fights in the arena punctuated by gratuitous sex scenes...And, yes, the battle scenes look way too much like 300."
"If you enjoy naked, sweaty men grappling each other, this is for you. Full frontal nudity: Crixus standing there while a patrician Roman woman inspected his goods was a little too much. Shaved pubic hair and the black skin of his penis is a sure indicator of steroid abuse. We have characters alternately speaking like Shakespeare and then hurling obscenities as if they were on an inner city bus after the local ghetto school was let out. Soft core porn of men doing women, men doing men, and women doing women and you pretty much see what this is really about. Extremely phony fight scenes where gladiators fight on after losing 40% of their blood... This has nothing to do with Spartacus - it's just a revolting exploitation vehicle. I stopped watching it. What's up with the signature scene, appearing in each episode, where a gladiator gets whacked in the face, his head spins around, and a pint of blood splashes out of his mouth? Then he always continues as if nothing had happened, without so much as a swollen lip."
"Spartacus (Andy Whitfield/Liam McIntyre) was a Thracian who refused to fight after being lied to by Roman commander Claudius Glaber. He is enslaved as well as his wife Sura. He is eventually purchased by Batiatus (John Hannah) as he is thrown into the world gladiators. The house of Batiatus is full of intrigue led in part by his wife Lucretia (Lucy Lawless). He would rebel and bring Rome to the brink.It's a Starz production. It's blood splattering gore. It's full on sexuality. The violence is over the top. The fights are slow motion poetry. The story is human depravity at its finest. The show took a look at any restrictions and laughed at its face. The first season ends with the breakout of the House of Batiatus. Andy Whitfield was Spartacus. However he got sick, and the show next did a six-part prequel without Whitfield. When he died, the show continues with Liam McIntyre as Spartacus.If this was a simple exploitation fare, I wouldn't rate it so high. The story is just so fun. John Hannah and Lucy Lawless really have a lot of fun playing the devious duo. The twists and turns come fast and furious. It's like an earlier 'Game of Thrones' with more nudity. The last season is hamstrung by the fact that it's history that Spartacus dies."
"There's not much to say about this one. Its basically, Fighting, Gore, and Sex; on repeat. If that's your thing, then it's not that bad of a show."
"A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7."
"Narcos was a great and in a way emotional adventure trip that broke my heart. Despite many violence and bloody scenes it offers top entertainment and non stop adrenaline. The best I liked was the very excellent performance of Wagner Moura, Pedro Pascal and all the other actors that played their roles cool and very credible. I want to thank all of you, each of you deserved an Oscar or other kind of awards. I am thinking already to watch it again. The intro song is always very nice to hear. It gives those mini series the right atmosphere and kick to start the Narcos thrill. 10/10. If you liked this genre of series you shouldn't miss Breaking Bad."
"This is by far the best thing I ever saw about the life of Pablo Escobar and the Colombian crisis. Everything in this show is perfect. The actors are sublime, every actor is very believable in his role. The narrating voice through the whole series works really well to me. Also the real video fragments from the news in that time between the fiction works really well. I was completely addicted to this show after the first episode. I saw the whole season in a couple days. Can't wait for season two honestly. If all series would be at the same level as this one I would probably never set a foot outside anymore and just watch television all day. Narcos will definitely be the show of the year. Great job from Netflix!"
"'The production values of Narcos are quite high, and the acting very good. Pablo Escobar was larger than life, and his story is fascinating, so anyone setting out to portray it gets a huge head start. Wild and amazing, yet true! I have watched a couple other Escobar depictions, and this one focuses on the DEA officers involved in his pursuit and take down.My only substantive complaint is that the narration is excessive and unnecessary. It would have been possible to dramatize most of what was said by the narrators, and in some cases the narration was insulting to the viewer as it was evident from the images on the screen what was going on. I am not sure why directors are insisting on using this technique. It works for some films but is sometimes annoying, as in this case.The unwanted overvoice narration notwithstanding, Narcos is overall very good.'"
"'This was a very good animated series. At first, one could think that it is something like Ben 10 (Read: an American cartoon that tries too hard to imitate the visual style and characterization from anime series) but I ended liking this series. The animation is nice and detailed, the characters are interesting and have a great development while the plot advances, the storyline is complex and very well made, full of action, drama, comedy and mystery. Many of the elements of the story seem to be influenced by the mythology of China and India, and the result is simply incredible. The writers managed very well to keep the plot interesting, from the very beginning until the end. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best cartoons ever produced by Nickelodeon, along with Invader Zim, Rocko and Ren & Stimpy (Despite being completely different to those series) I highly recommend to anyone.10/10'"
"'Everything about this show is outstanding. There is so much care put into the world, characters and storyline, and it really shows. The best parts are the elemental powers and the depth of the story. It goes far beyond a typical cartoon series.'"
"Avatar: The Last Airbender deserves some serious credit for introducing a new generation to the anime genre. It is extremely hard to not enjoy this series. It has lovable characters, real dangers, plot development, perfectly-timed comedy and a really well thought out storyline.This series is perfectly suited to adults and children alike. Don't kid yourself there are serious issues dealt with but many children will miss those themes and will just appreciate the comedy.If you find yourself enjoying this series then I also recommend you watch The Legend of Korra too. Korra is much darker than Avatar but just as entertaining and intelligent."
"Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) is reassigned to his home town of Harlan County, eastern Kentucky and forced to confront his criminal father. Ava Crowder (Joelle Carter) killed her abusive husband. Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) is in the local criminal element. Raylan has a past with them all including coal mining with Boyd.This show is based on Elmore Leonard's story and developed by Graham Yost. The hallmark of this show is its great characters. Olyphant is good. Joelle Carter has both the femme fatale and the damsel in distress. She plays both extremely well. Walton Goggins is the show's guiding light. Other outstanding performances include Margo Martindale, Jeremy Davies and Damon Herriman. The dialog has a sharp fun style and the show never really has a letdown season over the years."
"Definitely a show with a few really fun characters.\nWhat's best about the series is precisely its main character, U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens.\nWalton Goggins is great as Boyd Crowder, as is Nick Searcy as Art Mullen.\nEach season is fun and interesting in its own way, and the characters become more fun and layered over time.\nIt's quite a real rarity to see characters like Raylan Givens and Art Mullen on television.\nA fun and interesting series that is definitely worth watching."
As great as Timothy Olyphant is as playing the Raylan Givens character he's made better by having a good character like Walton Goggins' character Boyd Crowder to play off of.In season one Boyd was in the pilot which was a great pilot but then because of other obligations Goggins didn't return until later that season. And while the non Boyd episodes of Justified were still decent TV they weren't as great as when Boyd returned to the show. The show without Boyd was just a villain of the week type of show. But with Boyd back on the show was much more of a serial show were the story lines carrier over from week-to-week instead of being selt contained episodes.
"'Justified had real promise when it first started. It wasn\'t just a cop show, but also a bit of a Western. with old-fashioned lawman Raylan Givens chasing down modern fugitives. He\'s kind of a dick, but the best kind: a charming one. And Timothy Olyphant was (is) perfect for this role. But just beyond that first season, the show became serialized and blossomed into an honest-to-god crime drama. This is exactly why it became one of my all-time favorite TV shows; it was quietly riveting week-in and week-out. But it was also a world full of entertaining characters and a cast to match. Walton Goggins proved to be Olyphant\'s equal as his primary opposition (and a show highlight), and this Kentucky underworld is one I often couldn\'t wait to return to. Put simply, it\'s an Elmore Leonard joint, complete with his ear- candy dialog and offbeat characters; and that\'s enough for me. But they went and made it one of the funniest, engaging and rewarding shows I\'ve ever seen. 10/10'"
"You'd expect people to say that about DC trying to place themselves as a worthy opponent and rival to Marvel. And while in the Comic Book world it is a competition, it's hard to see that in the Movie universe happening anytime soon. Which is a shame when you think that this also could've been so much better.While I've only seen the cinematic version (not the extended one), this unfortunately wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for. Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this. Also the action, no matter how far fetched and stretched it may seem, kind of works too. Just do not compare it under no circumstances with Guardians ..."
"'It could be defined as phenomenon. or as the truth portrait expected by public. a serie about politic remembering Shakespeare comedies. a film about power, its levels, its price, its victims, its roots. impeccable acted, having perfect script. and proposing the cold view about every day near reality. so, more than a serie. preserving the mark of Kevin Spacey performance .'"
"This is tough to call a sit com. There's nothing funny in anything I've ever seen.And nothing relative to anyone who ever lived in the seventies.The show is completely alien to lifestyles and comedy of the seventies. There isn't one character anyone outside of Hollywood can relate to.Trying to find an asset to this show is like finding a needle in a haystack, exactly. There probably is one, but the show is so dull, and the characters so dull and unrecognizable, that you couldn't possibly care.Sad to think that a hundred years from now, some future soul will watch this and think the seventies decade was anything like this. It wasn't. It's written and performed by Hollywood brats who have more control and power than they should. They abuse their control with giving us their lack of inspiration over and over.Such is the case with this pathetic show. If anyone reads this a few centuries from today, let it be known that the show was for a few rich kids, and had nothing to do with anyone else."
"'This was a quaint little show that could featuring the comedic day to day misadventures of Eric Forman and his small group of friends as they grow up in the otherwise dreary awful \'me\' decade of the 1970\'s. I wasn\'t sure if I\'d like this show before I watched it. But thankfully all the crappy 70\'s nostalgia was kept pretty much to a minimum and it thankfully allowed the characters some breathing room (this is why the polar opposite That 80\'s Show failed dismally). Sadly after 3 or 4 seasons the show became a pale parody of itself culminating in a simply unwatchable 8th season. If the show only lasted half that long it would\'ve been fine with me. That 70\'s show was never anywhere close to classic in any way, shape, or form and other comedies of the \'90\'s could and did run circles around it, but in the beginning seasons it was a fun enough time waister. By the way the best part of the show was definitely Eric\'s father, Red.My Grade: C'"
"'THAT \'70S SHOW, in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven\'t seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. I liked it when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run, especially Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He was my favorite character. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope it stays on FX for fans of the show to see for a long time.'"
"The mysterious disappearance of 2% of the world's population has not been answered or solved seven years later. As the anniversary approaches, the characters that survived are worried that something will happen. Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) is still struggling with his experience dying and coming back to life. Nora Durst (Carrie Coon) misses her family who disappeared on that day and learns of a way to encounter them again. Laurie Garvey (Amy Brenneman) has married John Murphy (Kevin Carroll) and they run a scamming business where they pretend to speak to the dead. Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston) is writing a book about Kevin and all the miracles that he has seen in Mapleton and Jarden. The third and final season moves the characters to Australia where Kevin's father Kevin Garvey Sr. (Scott Glenn) believes that a great flood is coming on the 7 year anniversary and he has to find a song to stop it. Nora's search for her missing children also brings her to Australia where she believes a mysterious group has a device that shoots a person with radiation and sends them to where everyone else went. Kevin has taken to putting a bag over his head and thinks a trip to Australia will help him get away from whatever he fears.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
"'I\'m amazed at the ratings associated with this show. To my mind its title pretty much sums it up, The Leftovers. Its a rather uninspiring mish mash of a range of well worn ideas, reminiscent of shows like Lost, Legion, The 4400 and others where something is amiss. People either appear or in this case disappear without obvious cause. Is it Angels, ET\'s? I\'d be inclined to say who cares. After two tedious episodes where nothing really happens aside from an odd ball cult who all dress like 1950\'s milkmen/asylum orderlies with a smoking habit and a vow of silence I\'d had enough. The rest is horribly formulaic too, the cop with a predictable drinking problem, wife and daughter issues, son hanging around with yet another cult. You get the idea. The acting is alright but there were no stand out performance\'s on offer that I could see either. Not surprising as this show provided me with scant inspiration. Five out of ten.'"
"I know the idea has been done before but The Mentalist delivers where others were lacking. I am very impressed with the direction of the show and all the elements seem to gel exceptionally well. The cast is definitely what makes this series successful. They're all interesting, have their individual quirks and make you want to like them. Simon Baker is fantastic as the aloof yet triumphant consultant and Robin Tunney is a great contrast to his character as the witty no- nonsense senior agent for the CBI.Every week they seem to come up with new and fresh ideas for the show which keeps it from feeling stale. And because of the personal back-stories that are continually evolving you understand the motives behind the characters decisions. A truly unique comedy/crime/drama show."
"'Not in my opinion. Aside from the fact that both shows incorporate a psychic in the lead role the two shows have nothing to do with one another. If anything, The Mentalist is what Psych would have been if it had ever grown up. Psych is a lightweight comedy compared to The Mentalist. That\'s not to say that Psych doesn\'t have its merits, but it\'s not in the same league as the Mentalist, IMO.The problem with The Mentalist isn\'t that it\'s a copy of Psych, it\'s that it starts off great and then fizzles, like too many other shows. I\'ve rarely seen a show with this degree of inconsistency. While binge watching it on cable there were entire episodes that were so out of touch I simply fast forwarded through 90% of the show. That happened several times.Compounding that were glaring plot holes that you could drive a truck through. And suspension of disbelief was stretched beyond reasonable limits. It\'s a shame. A show that started out cutting edge with a cast that worked well together devolved into a mess that was indistinguishable from the first season. Too bad. It had a lot of potential.'"
"Okay, there are just way too many crime dramas on television these days. I prefer sitcoms. I think the partnership of Simon Baker and Robin Tunney is interesting. They have a lot of chemistry on screen. Apart from the actual crime solving on the shows, Simon's character is a mentalist or a fake psychic or fraud charlatan before he became an investigator and working on the right side instead of the wrong side. The mentalists are not exactly psychics but people who are very in tuned with details almost obsessively. While there are people out there who are skeptics about psychics and paranormal, there are legitimate psychics who don't exactly make a living from their gift but share with others. The mentalist doesn't believe in psychics exist but I disagree. I think there are some things that are just beyond explanation. I wish well for the Mentalist but it has too much competition already."
"'Crime investigation television series do try hard in order to find an interesting theme to accompany the crimes with. Jane\'s story though is quite entertaining, that his case alone would have made a good show. I actually can\'t believe that the Red John case took so long and still had me hooked till the last minute. And even after that, the two seasons after RJ were good as well. Maybe it\'s because Jane has a unique way with dealing with the cases he has to solve. And it is really interesting to watch him read his suspects and create his plots. The romantic part though wasn\'t that good; it was more awkward than interesting. So, 6 out of 10.'"
"for a fan of Christian Bale, American Psycho is a real challenge. because his Paul Bateman seems be perfect. the mixture of cold cruelty, dark humor, the violence as error, the fall and the cynical speeches, the spirit of novel who becomes large, dark shadow who defines as parable the every day events, the almighty monster who is so vulnerable than the compassion of the viewer becomes , scene by scene, more deep, the sex scenes who are memorable, the run from himself in the cage of appearances, all is seductive, strange and bizarre . and convincing because it is only portrait of social crisis who defines us. a film who could be useful for discover the dark side from yourself. and an admirable Christian Bale's job."
"Patrick Jane helps the CBI, led by Lisbon to find the guilty using his special talent to read people. At the same time he searches for the killer known as 'Red John', whose responsible for the murder of Jane's wife and child.I watch this show on a Friday after a long hard day of college, I laugh and laugh at Jane's exploits, his mannerisms, his quirky nature and his charming nature. More importantly, Jane is supported by the double act that is Kimbal Cho and Wayne Rigsby, they are just plain out funny, having their little banter between drives from crime scenes, Van Pelt adds the awkwardness that is simply hilarious, when she is around Rigsby.For me the hook was the end of the pilot, when we realise Red John history with Jane, simply stunning....One of the finest scenes I've ever seen.The one thing that does concern me, is the length of the Red John mystery, viewers may grow bored of the endless clues and near-misses to catch the serial killer....But, I'll always keep watching...."
"It is an end of an era, more or less. Bravo, they did a great job ending it, even though they still haven't really ended it. Well, I stopped watching so it ended for me. Seriously, the guys behind Naruto should just end it. Baruto looks promising but give us a break already, stop milking beloved franchises into the ground. Dragonball Super made a joke out of the DBZ universe and Baruto could do just the same thing to Naruto. Anyway, if you are planning on watching this series or watching it again then I recommend doing what I did, skipping all of the filler episodes. Seriously, a fillerless viewing of this show is literally animated art as far as I am concerned."

"'Best characters, best score just sooo good ! A Must Watch'"
"'This was just wonderful! Only complaints are the way they got rid of Madara , the inclusion of the Otsutsuki rabbit woman and that Sasuke and Naruto were reincarnations of those 2 guys i forgot their names. They fell completely out of place from the rest of the series. Other than that it was a magnificent journey.'"
Not what I'm looking for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"'The film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. I know places and people that might pass for the world in The Killing. I have witnessed people fall apart because of those around them. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is effective. This is the kind of film that truly proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people. All characters are unhappy souls, surviving in a grim world, unable to improve their lot, with violent dogs barking everywhere.'"
"'Upon first learning of the AMC series The Killing I was a little confused since Stanley Kubrick directed a heist-themed movie with that title. But this is a really impressive series. Adapted from the Danish series Forbrydelsen, it focuses on a Seattle police detective (Mireille Enos) investigating a murder amid a political campaign. Various and sundry secondary and tertiary characters assist in the investigation. There\'s a little bit more revealed on each episode, but never so much that it gives away the whole plot. The result is a very good show. I do hope to see the original Danish series.* *Other US series based on foreign series were All in the Family, Sanford and Son and Ugly Betty.'"
"Like a parody of the genre, only to be taken seriously. First season was entertaining and intriguing enough, then it all went to unintentionally funny territory when characters became stereotypical, the acting subpar and the script, silly and convoluted. Complex for no real reasons. I stopped counting the number of times I thought I could end watching the series there, and not feel sorry about it. But I can't. There are no real appeal left to the story, once the conspiracy Â« thickens Â». And seeing Mireille Enos trying to look serious and lost in her own thoughts, every ten seconds, gets old really fast. It was awkward, as if she was feeling sick or something. Maybe she did, who knows..."
"'I see fan boys are out in full force for this show even though it ended in 2011. The show was never too my liking and I collected all these comic books, The Flash, Superman, Batman and Aquaman to name just a few.I\'m a traditionalist. I do not care for this teenybopper show. It has all the characters from Clark\'s later life all crammed in to one Smallville. Lex doesn\'t show up until much later in Clark\'s adult life. The same with all the other superheroes and supervillains. None of them were in SmallvilleThe show really is about grabbing two demographics, teens and fanboys. The show is always geared around a few male and female shots of abs or breasts/asses. It has a weak story with deus ex machina in ever single episode. You have more kryptonite in this one small town that you have in the entire Universe, yet kryptonite is supposed to be extremely rare.Overall this show deserves Golden Raspberry awards for every actor, director, writer and episode. It\'s just a crappy show made for immature people.Your boos mean nothing, I\'ve seen what makes you cheer!'"
"American Psycho is a cult psychological thriller and satirical film directed by Mary Harron based on Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the title. It stars Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux, Bill Sage, ChloÃ« Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, and Samantha Mathis. The film focuses on Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman, whose mental instability and blood lust lead him to serial killing.Patrick Bateman, the son of a wealthy Wall Street financier, is pursuing his own lucrative career with his father's firm. Bateman is the prototypical yuppie, obsessed with success, fashion, and style. He is also a serial killer who murders, rapes, and mutilates both strangers and acquaintances without provocation or reason. Donald Kimble, a police detective, questions Bateman about the disappearance of Paul Allen, whom Patrick murdered several days earlier. As Kimble stays on Bateman's trail, Bateman's mask of studied, distant cool begins to fall apart. This satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classicism with homicide, but you may laugh at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.But nevertheless,Bale nails Bateman with a sublimely dead-eyed and deadpan performance.Also,it captures the 80's era when the events of this film happened.Overall,it is an underrated masterpiece."
"'Smallville': right. Aptly named because it's exceedingly small on every issue of entertainment. Casting, acting, script, originality; you name it, you've seen it all before. It's as by-the-numbers as a cake recipe.This is the epitome of modern made-for-TV American dross. It's one of an increasing number of shows from the States (and sadly, also from Britain, now) that you can actually watch and follow with the sound turned off. It's that simplistic. And it's just as well, because nothing is said that's worth hearing. Camera shots, facial expressions and body-language takes are so stereotypic and juvenile. Subtlety has no place in modern media. Every 'adult' has to behave like a large sexually-aware child. In fact this point is taken to such extreme that there simply are no old or even middle-aged people in Smallville. Everyone above the age of 30 has been deleted! Nor are there any children. Didin't anyone have parents or younger siblings? Doesn't anyone keep pets? Because I've yet to see a cat or a dog. Perhaps the makers spent too much time watching 'Logan's Run'. And of course; every female has a pert and well figured body, whilst every man has exemplary pects and a six-pack. So it would appear that along with ageing; obesity and unhealthy lifestyles have also been ironed-out in this idealised vision of absurdity. This is 'Scooby Doo' but without Scooby Doo and with real actors playing cartoon stereotypes.Strictly for backward children."
Smallville didn't create anything when it was on air. When Arrow came to the scene all the other shows followed because of its success.Smallville was a good show nevertheless. Its a superman show. We've seen it all already.The acting is alright and the story is what we've seen many times. I have nothing bad or great to say about it. It had a great run tho.Verdict: Watch and enjoy.
"I enjoy this show. It's pretty great. My favorite seasons are the earlier ones. Season 1 - 4 all tie as my favorite. Then with each season, I like it less and less. Don't get me wrong, the other six seasons are all still good. The story lines are good and the cast are very talented.This show is about the evolution of Clark Kent, the man we know as Superman. We see him discovering himself as a teenager, and what he must go through to become the legend we all have heard of. Overall, I give this TV show an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome."
One would have been sufficient ... a world class piece of crap ... the male star looks like a crack addict and his smarts are answering jeopardy questions which most morons and imbeciles can do with ease ... a phd in economics makes him mr wizard for 2 minutes ... i'm saying not to waste time watching buncko
"Do we need another spionage series? If it's well done why not. I just finished the first season and it was entertaining, with a good story and some suspense. It's not at the same level as Homeland or The Americans, which are both top shows about spionage, but it's good enough to have a nice evening, or in my case a couple of binge watching evenings. To me the minor point is John Krasinski playing Jack Ryan. I can't help it but I just can't see him as a CIA agent. He should stick with his funny romantical characters. But besides that it's a good series, and I can see it making several seasons without being boring."
"Firstly the people giving a positive rating to Season Two positively are single use accounts, using a lot of similar phrasing. IE marketing people, not actual audience.Lets get this straight: Tom Clancy was not Proust, he wrote reasonably well written, highly studied on the facts, but not great novels. But his work is NOT marvel comics and this series has become a comic book nonsense. Thirdly, Clancy did sometimes do the geopolitics in broad strokes, but he never ever would have made the basic error of portraying a socialist dictator as a right wing dictator. Where were the fact checkers for this series when some idiot inverted a basic geopolitical fact (Venezuela's left wing dictatorship into right wing) ???Krasinki walks through this second season as if he didn't care. Maybe it is his over-rated acting skills or maybe he knew the script was so bad that he didn't care, but he is almost sneering at the audience with his portrayal.Really everything about season two is cringe-worthy."

"'This is a show I love to hate and hate to love. It took awhile to get going. Although this show is about as unrealistic as it gets, you have to keep in mind it is tv..and not intended on being REAL. The characters have almost all been with each other romantically, sort of like Melrose place. Some of the storylines were not that great or interesting but at the end of the episode, I still found myself anxiously awaiting the next. I never watched the show when it aired. Just recently watched on Netflix. I watched all episodes over about a week\'s time. My least fave character was JENNY. There was something about her that I couldn\'t stand. The The character Chuck Bass had facial expressions and a voice that was exaggeratedly done and sort of annoying but I still liked him. I don\'t think there was one single episode that didn\'t include the line I am chuck Bass in it. I give the show a 7 because the storylines could have been better, but it was still entertaining enough to watch. I was bummed out that I ran out of episodes to watch. The ending was not what I hoped for but it is what it is.'"
'This TV Show THE BEST for escaping the world for a little bit. Such an intriguing plot and so much romance! I love it!'
"It is entertaining, if you like the genre. I would be cutting my wrists if my son and daughters had that style of life and I wouldn't want them to see it, because of the bad examples. For mature people, it is fun, love the fashion styles and the characters are likable enough to make one want to check in for the next episode"
'I like the bit where he dropped a chainsaw down the stairs on the woman'
The show was a copy of TVD which means it had strong performances great action-thriller scenes and constant suspense plus we did not got bored with that VD Helena love triangle but the show suffered from the same supernatural problems the vampire diaries suffered too.At some point they have to understand that killing someone for good and then to bring him back to life whenever they want in his body or in another body it doesn't make sense and kills the suspense of killing someone.I Mean....what's the point that almost all of our heroes were once dead but then somehow they were resurrected again ?so....Klaus father was dead but claus mother brings him back to life only for claus to kill him again.......OK so what the heck ? if they want they will bring him back. that is the major flaw for both shows.when someone is dead....................is dead don't bring him back. it ruins everything if u want to have a realistic show.apart from that if u are a fan of TVD u will love that show too even more better but at some point u will be tired of the same formula.I now reached season 3 of this show and season 6 of TVD and I only watch it now to see how the stories will end as I know that death really not matters anymore in those series.
"The Originals is much more than some teen supernatural drama. The storyline is extremely compelling and explores an old topic in a new and fresh way. There are no victims in this show, everyone has their own strengths and it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.I also find the cast really likable and even when they return to their old evil ways you can still see the humanity in the characters. I can't help but want to like them as they've been through so much pain in the past.Now I must confess that yes I love all things supernatural including Twilight...but the difference is I am well aware that the Twilight movie is absolutely terrible, and in-spite of that I love it but The Originals is actually good.There's action, romance and great special effects. All round an entertaining show."
'Ending way too soon. I loved the intelligent dialogue with great vocabulary. Not many shows can match that. It was by far the best vampire series ever!'
"_February 2020_Season 5 got to my throat as it unfolded, it was sad and depressing not to see Hayley; I knew she will die in the season, I just didn't know when and how. Today, I reached that fateful episode...Never have I felt so sad and beaten for the fate, endured pain and untimely death of a beloved character. She died heroically and selflessly saving her loved one. Her facial expressions in her last moments still haunt me.\nMy throat is clamped and my eyes are bright.I loved you Hayley. I loved your kindness, strength and beauty. You were a wonderful being, a warrior and a true hero.May you find peace, comfort and solace wherever you are.RIP\n(On season 1)\nA series where the production value is being crushed by the depressing atmosphere and the truly uninteresting unfolding of stories and events.A series where the actors and actresses are tremendously talented, try their best, but, throughout each season, the dismay and consternation keep getting to your throat and clamp it hard.A series where almost everything is theatrical, fake and out of place.An ensemble of events and storylines, which lack brightness, luster and fail to nurture viewers' attention.\nThe rating is for its production value and stellar acting, which cannot be ignored.\nPhoebe Tonkin and Claire Holt are gorgeous in their respective roles and a joy to watch.(Before season 4)\nEnjoyably, It gets better season after season."
"'Not AS addicting as TVD, but worth a watch. In TVD rebekah was my favorite original, and i was thinking she would be my favorite in here, but thats not the case.In this show you truly see what the bond always and forever truly means, and i adored that. One of the best things in shows in my opinion is loyalty, and this show has no shortage of that. Klaus really stepped up and showed what his family meant to him in here, and had a BIG development as the show went on.eventually you are introduced to what i would say is truly my favorite character(outside of the original family) which is davina. she is bad ass when it came to standing up to klaus.as the show goes on you are also introduced to the long lost sister freya, and at first her intentions are questionable(at least to me), but as the show went on she became my favorite character!.Although sad I was satisfied with the ending.'"
"'Desperate Housewives is a comedy/drama that leans more to the comedy side of things and is decidedly aimed at (drum roll please) housewives! Sure, it\'s a show most adults, male or female can enjoy, but the writers are hellbent into making it a woman\'s show.\nIf I\'m correct, only one lady out of the four leads is actually married, the others being divorced, widowed or simply on the prawl for a new male partner.\nThese are women in their mid 30s to late 40s and I find it rather odd to see a show making fun out of pretty serious stuff: divorce, cheating, promiscuity, etc. Maybe I\'m taking this stuff too serious but I simply don\'t find this show as compelling as say, Friends.\nI don\'t mean to sound mysoginous but Desperate Housewives is, to me, a show exclusively for those wives bored and annoyed with their marriages.\nIf they feel that way, maybe they should end their relationships and do whatever they please, just like the desperate wives they idolize on this TV show.'"
"'Certainly the idea of an appearance of normalcy with all the treachery that goes on beneath is a theme that\'s been done many times. Nothing new there. But I enjoy this show for several reasons. It has some actresses I really like in it, i.e., Teri Hatcher, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Nicolette Sheridan. It\'s great to see all of them working and in a hit. Since I\'m not a fan of the reality show trend, I also like the idea that this is not one - nor, of course, do I find it very realistic. (I did, however, catch a woman on Oprah who swears she is a clone of the Marcia Cross character so maybe it\'s not so out there after all.) I like the fact that it\'s a combo of Letter to Three Wives and Twin Peaks. There\'s a mystery - we don\'t know why the narrator killed herself, and we don\'t know what certain people are doing in the neighborhood or what they\'re investigating/covering up. That darkish aspect is what makes it interesting.'"
"Sometimes, a series or a movie hooks you so much that when it ends, it's like a part of yourself is gone with it. You cry, you shed tears, you cannot stop thinking about it. Like a lost lover who's decided to go and leave you all alone.That is what Desperate Housewives is for me.\n8 seasons of sheer joy and emotions. A rollercoaster of pleasure, bliss, sadness and thrill throughout.It has quality written all over it. It has one the best script, story, cast and acting in the whole TV industry.\nBrenda Strong's voice and narrative alone are enough to make you shiver, have goosebumps and dream. She was extraordinary and breathtaking.I loved Marcia Cross. She was my favourite, ever since I got to know her from Melrose Place.\nShe is one of the most beautiful, talented and wonderful actresses out there. She just shines. She has depth and class painted all over her. Would like to see more of her in series. Marcia please!7 years have passed since I finished the show, but I still feel it like it was the first day. I'm enthusiastic and excited about it like my first glance on it.It's my guilty pleasure and one of the most cherished series of my life."
"An intriguing mystery, a stonking cast and a poignant performance by Reese Witherspoon look like making Big Little Lies appointment viewing for the next couple of months.With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Alexander Skarsgard on board, the series isn't short of star wattage, but it's Witherspoon's performance as Madeline Mackenzie, a wife and mother who feels cruelly superfluous in her own home, that reels the viewer in in this first episode.The drama takes place in Monterey, California, where Silicon Valley's nouveau riche rub shoulders with the working class as parents of pupils at a particularly desirable public school. Writer David E. Kelley - adapting the novel by Australian Liane Moriarty - and director Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers' Club), quickly establish a tense little world in which quiet desperation cuts across all income brackets.Then a glitzy fundraiser for the school ends in murder."
"'I must warn you a bit about Big Little Lies. This HBO series is very violent, with vivid depictions of domestic violence. It also has a lot of nudity. In addition, the show is one that EASILY could overwhelm viewers...especially those who have been through domestic violence and rape. A tough show....but an amazing one. So, if you\'re inviting over Father O\'Malley or your mother, you might just want to think twice about seeing this one with them.The series is about three women in Monterey, California....a very expensive and swank town to live in, though not quite as swank as nearby Carmel. Regardless, the story centers on these women as well as the men and children in their lives...as well as their \'friends\' who are mostly social climbing back-biters and jerks. I could say so much more about the plot....suffice to say it\'s exquisitely written and has some of the best acting you could ever hope to see. Considering there are tons of reviews about the series already, I\'ll just end it here with an admonition to watch the show...it\'s sensational.By the way, as a trained therapist and ex-social worker, I really appreciated the writing of this show. Their portrayal of domestic violence as well as how a therapist works were both spot on and I appreciate this.'"
"'A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.'"
"'The main thing that I took from Big Little Lies is that we lead screwed-up existences. The protagonists have what look like the ideal lives, but it becomes clear that something is amiss. Whether it\'s a lack of fulfillment or something worse, all three are living a lie. The story gets told as a series of interviews to let the viewer know that the action is building up to something big.I wouldn\'t call this the best miniseries that HBO has made (remember, this is the channel that gave us The Sopranos and Game of Thrones), but serves as a good look at the problems that arise when we try to ignore the simmering tensions amid a supposedly perfect world. The morally complex characters make this a series for the ages. Not to mention that it\'s a treat to see Reese Witherspoon play a role markedly different from the ones with which she\'s usually associated. And as someone who went to grad school in Monterey, it was neat to see some of my old haunts.I recommend it, and I hope to read the book, and that Jean-Marc VallÃ©e (of Dallas Buyers Club and Wild) keeps turning out work like this.'"
"Season 1 is ok. Season 2 is where it peaks and then it's straight downhill from there. Season 3 is completely awful. Season 4 is better, but then seasons 5 and 6 are absolutely painful to watch. Absolutely painful. Could have been a good show."
"'The series started strongly, with a refreshing story and some entertaining music numbers. However, some characters were simply annoying. And, in the end, the originality of the story ran out and the only thing left were the annoying characters, the predictable plot and some boring musical performances.'"
"'The first time I saw the promos for this show, I thought that it was going to be pretty bad, like those awful High School Musical films. However, when I watched it, I was surprised of how good it was: The plot and the characters were pretty interesting, the songs were incredibly good, and the performances were more than decent. I like this show very much. It is one of the best shows to be still on air.This show was made by the creator of Nip Tuck, but this show is way more light-hearted and optimistic. And more enjoyable too.No wonder why this show is so successful, it is one of the best shows of the recent years. Glee deserves all the hype it receives.'"
"'As someone who was a bit of an outcast in school, Glee is pretty interesting for me. Having just binge-watched the first season, I\'d say that this look at a collection of high school students participating in the glee club is a good show. As it was, a lot of the songs that they perform I learned from Weird Al Yankovic\'s spoofs (e.g., Like a Virgin became Like a Surgeon).I\'ll be eager to see the rest of the series. I like how it develops the characters\' personal lives as the show progresses and avoids stereotyped characters. Indeed, I expected Kurt\'s father to be a hard-ass but he accepts his son\'s homosexuality. Even the malevolent Sue Sylvester has her own story.So far I like this show. I\'ll have to see the following seasons. It\'s too bad that Cory Monteith died of a drug overdose.'"
"'it is a real revolution. for the art to transform rules of crime movie. for the game of imagination. for the image of evil. for strange humor. and for obsessive music. so, it is a provocation. fascinating, full of mysteries and fake ways, with taste of pie and shadow of a young woman, with the mythical characters and a FBI agent out of any definition. a good movie ? not exactly. only a great experience. because, after years, the story, the music, picture of Laura Palmer, silhouette of agent Cooper are fresh memories. because the Gothic atmosphere is almost seductive after years. because it is a great work or just an iconic film. because after Twin Peaks meeting all is different for its public.'"
"'Having watched Matt Bomer as a spy in Chuck, it\'s not a far walk to see him as a charming, sparkle in the eye, confidence man Neal Caffrey. Starting in prison, he escapes, only to be tracked down by the same FBI agent - Tim DeKay as Peter Burke - who put him there in the first place, who knows more about Neal than he does about his wife. Found holding a bottle of wine - which rather than being a goof, is a device created to drive a future plot line - he\'s carted back to prison, but after coming up with a vital lead in a case the FBI are working on.\nAnd this is basically the three plot lines for the rest of the series; each episode has a crime that can only be solved with Neals confidence tricks.\nNeal is trying to track down a lost love, through carefully created clues that are pertinent to their lives.\nNeal helps Peter with his personal life, while Peter helps Neal using his FBI connections.\nYou know they\'ll get the bad guys, but then what series doesn\'t that happen? It\'s how they do it and following the treasure hunt that keeps the show interesting.'"
"'I watched the first episode of this, which only had 2-3 stupid bits of writing in it, and the actors played reasonably well, although a bit clichÃ©d in body language and style. The concept is pretty obvious, has been done before many times (Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte in 48 hours, etc) but there is nothing wrong with the concept.So I bought episode 2, and watched about 1/3 of it. Clearly, the writers are either different, or were intellectually exhausted by the pilot. There are so many things wrong here, so many caricatures and clichÃ©s, so many plot holes and stupid behaviour on the part of the good guys. Do Americans really like this? Why is it so many many people here vote this up above 8.0? Truly I am amazed.AVOID THIS SHOW.'"
"'There is a lot to like about White Collar: charming cast, good acting and writing, funny enough. Where it fails is in the modern phenomena of binge watching. The weaknesses of the show that you don\'t really pick up when watching episodes once or twice a week come more into focus when watching episode after episode. For example, there is a repeition of criminal betrays FBI Agent\'s trust, and then wins back that trust -- again and again and again. When watching the show periodically you don\'t think about it so much, but when watching seasons 1-6 in one month, you can\'t stop wondering, How many times would I forgive someone?'"
"'The O.C. is like the next 90210 except the show is not taken place in Beverly Hills it\'s taken place in Orange County which is another one of the Los Angeles suburbs. \'The O.C.\' tells the story of the Cohen, Cooper, and Nichol families, and Ryan Atwood, a troubled teen from the wrong side of the tracks, who is thrust into this world, and who will forever change the lives of the residents of The Orange County. The show has lots of things related to shifting loyalties and identities, of kids living secret lives hidden from their parents, and of parents living secret lives hidden from their children. This show premiered on FOX back in August 2003 and the show was a hit in terms of ratings that FOX brought the show back for a second season! This show brings back memories of the show 90210 because the show is similar in terms of the plot and it\'s taken place in the Los Angeles suburbs and teenager relationships!User Rating: 9/10BOTTOM LINE: THE NEXT 90210'"
"'Okay, so maybe Back to the Future seems a little hokey, but it\'s so cool! You probably know the story: typical \'80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it\'s probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it\'s an interesting contrast/comparison between the \'50s and \'80s. After all, who in the \'50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won\'t disappoint you.'"
"'This film tells the story of a family that stops at nothing to achieve what they want in life.This is a really good story that keeps me at the edge of my seat, even though there is nothing adrenaline inducing. The suspense is quite chilling, and I jus cannot wait to find out what will happen in the end. It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching.'"
'We just need to pretend that the show ended one season earlier'
"*The OC SPOILERS* Ryan Atwood (Ben McKenzie) is adopted by his lawyer Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), who brings him to his home in Orange County, where he lives with his wife Kirsten (Kelly Rowan) and son Seth (Adam Brody), who becomes instantly friends with Ryan.Ryan, with his simplicity and goodheartedness manages to fall for the most popular girl in town, Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton), whose father Jimmy (Tate Donovan) is a fraud and whose mother Julie (Melinda Clarke), who comes from the 'trailer park', so to speak, would do ANYTHING - and I do stress ANYTHING - to stay rich, including marrying tycoon Caleb Nichol (Alan Dale), Kirsten's father, and there beginning to tie all the families on the show into one. After Caleb's death she ended up dating Dr. Neil Roberts, Summer (Rachel Bilson) - Seth's crush-then-girlfriend-then-not-then-gf-again -'s father.In the meanwhile everybody has his or her sentimental - and psychological - trouble...Going into Season 3, the show seems to have regained some of the moment lost in the abysmal Season 2, with dry wit, drama and comedy mixed together, like old times.But now that the main female of the teens is dead, most probably the show will have to change tones.Is it going to be good? Or Not? We'll just have to wait November and see...The OC: 7/10."
'Very funny show. I like it when Al makes fun of fat women in the shoe store'
"'its secret of success is the art to transform insignificant, small every day details in the perfect show. because each of us is a member of the Bundy family or his neighbors. the frustrations, the fears, the embarrassing facts and the stereotypes are present in this amazing show about values and not charming sides of it. and this is all. and it is enough for see yourself from different angle, fore recognize common sins and for discover the old fashion comedy in new package but with the old ingredients . the life of an ordinary family across changes, challenges and sins. right answer to the pink worlds proposed by entertainment industry. and this does it special. so, Married with Children. and the voice of Frank Sinatra as introduction.'"
"A dysfunctional family headed by a loud mouth idiot is nothing new. In fact, it's a dime a dozen nowadays. But for its times, it pushed all the envelopes.Ed O'Neill delivers a big time performance as the loser husband shoe salesman. Katey Sagal creates a chocolate bonbon filled wife. Christina Applegate is the dim-witted blonde daughter. David Faustino is the creepy little brother.The writing is rock-solid. The show kept pushing the censors. The fact that many people opposed it just made it so much better. But it's the actors who created such outlandish characters that deserves the most praise. It lasted a shocking 11 years. The last few were of lower quality stuff, but it still deserves all the love."
'Except maybe Ari and Lloyd NONE of the boys who make up the little movie star entourage of buddies can act in this show. Vincent\'s actor has struggled after this show to find work in particular because he\'s such a boring actor you can\'t believe any of this good fortune is happening to. However the actor who played Vince\'s older brother Johnny ever found work in Hollywood is beyond me why anyone thought he would be a good idea in it. Except maybe one season everything good happens to them one episode after another like God needs Vince\'s permission for it to rain and ooh look another washed up celebrity cameo! Wow. This show has one of the worst opening songs ever and I like a lot of 90s rock. I used to watch this when I had nothing else to watch waiting for a new season of this or that show. At least it wasn\'t as bad as the movie. The movie was not needed at all. The only thing saving this from a 1 star is I did enjoy it somewhat and the series ended really well. However the movie was absolute garbage. Excuse me while I watch Eminem\'s cameo in season 8 on loop.'
"A show, true-to-life, about a bunch of tag alongs, who rather make money off of their friend, instead of getting a real job. I knew plenty of people like that, who had nothing going on with their lives and wanted to ride off of the coattails of others. That's all this show is about."
"Based loosely on Mark Wahlberg and his friends arriving in L.A. early in his career. This real life inspiration gives it good originality and a fresh take. Kevin Connolly is the cool headed best friend. Adrian Grenier is the hot sexy new star. Kevin Dillon is the older brother who has had limited success. Jerry Ferrara is the punchline to many of the group's jokes. And Jeremy Piven is the memorable scheming talent agent Ari.Girls, excess and the L.A. party scene draw us in but it's the group's friendship that keeps us watching. No matter what the obstacle, the group eventually pulls together but maybe after some hilarious ribbing. The last few season do feel a little stretched out. Ninety six hour-long episodes are a lot for any non-procedural serial."
"'Bringing Sherlock Holmes into the twentieth century, that concept has been tried before so I cannot say that this new show is original but Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu bring interesting interpretations to the roles of Holmes and Watson. Actually, Liu was the reason that I tuned in to watch the premiere. I have been a fan of hers ever since I saw the Charlie\'s Angels movies and I thought if anyone can play a tough heroine who can hold her own against any man it\'s her. She does precisely that in the premiere that I saw. This series looks like its going to be very dark and its characters haunted and tormented. Holmes by his addiction and Watson over the guilt she feels about a patient\'s death. There was one scene where Holmes coldly deduces that is what her problem is. I wanted Watson to punch him out right there! Holmes has never been played as more of an arrogant self righteous ass then he is in this show. I predict that this show isn\'t going to last very long. Oh well, maybe Lucy can make Charlie\'s Angels 3.'"
"Elementary sells itself fairly well, but it's almost a direct copy of House but for policework - the cases are convoluted, but unlike the medical seem to rely on a deus ex machina even more than House. Thus the Monk connection. The characters of Holmes and Watson are OK, but I just can't connect with them enough to make this primetime viewing of choice.All in all, this is adequate rather than great TV, the writer (who is also executive producer) seems to work out strange cases and expect us to fit our credulity to it - it would be better with a little bit more research and footwork and little less random associations.The show will do well, but I for one cannot rave about it."
"'all seems great. the idea, the script, the acting, the details who define each period. and the flavor of 50\'s in the most realistic manner to define it. sure, it is the result of a happy meeting between a courageous and real great director and the best actors for its project around a dream who is preserved by the imagination of each from us. but not the idea is the most important thing. the mixture of humor, tension, cultural references, the chemistry - yes, the word sounds strange but in this case is the best - between Christopher Lloyd and Michael Fox , the wise use of clichÃ©s about teenagers and family, the ignored guy who becomes hero, all make the story to roll in amazing manner. so, a sort of masterpiece. and one of the most adorable meet with a film. off course, a legendary one.'"
"Sherlock Holmes rises again, this time in the persona of Jonny Lee Miller, a self-centered, living off his father's trust fund morphine addict released/escaped from rehab and in the care of Ex- surgeon turned sour on a lost patient Dr Joan Watson (Lucy Liu). Though it is difficult to evaluate where this takeoff is going, at the present episode we do get to appreciate the much-tattooed Miller and the always beautiful Liu banter back and forth, with Holmes performing his rather mind-boggling ability to read clues and people and Watson as his 'guardian'. The show has possibilities though it is difficult to reconfigure the droll, elegant original Holmes in the form of this always-on-the-verge-of-withdrawal fast-talking new image. One of the finer moments of the new episode, almost ruined by Holmes misbehavior, is a moment at the opera where opera singers Randal Turner and Melissa Zapin are performing Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde'. Maybe there is hope that the series will progress down those lines of enlightenment. Grady Harp"
"Not interested at all in this series because the summary didn't fulfill what i do like in a series I never picked it up until a friend told me to do so because it's rather not that bad at all. Have seen the two seasons at this writing I must say that it is one of the best series I have seen so far.People of True Blood being involved it shows again. You have different 'people' in it like the white people, the Amish and the Indians and the androgen that does give Banshee a special touch. But not only that, the characters are very strong and the way it was shot is excellent with a lot of arty-shots. To give it an extra touch the score used is special too. I wont go into the story itself because it do evolve every time and some things you just don't see coming. It never has a boring moment, every episode delivers excellent suspense full of action (some rather gory), fight scene's that are brutal, a lot of nudity even full frontal and extreme people. After Spartacus and The Walking Dead series this surely follows in my personal top 5. A must see.Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 2,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
"A mysterious ex-convict leaves prison and arrives in Banshee, Pennsylvania tracking his love Anastasia Rabitov. He is at Sugar Bates' bar when a fight breaks out. One of the dead is the newly arrived Lucas Hood who is set to take over as sheriff. With the help of computer hacker Job, he takes on the identity of Lucas Hood and becomes the new sheriff in town. Ana has lived a life of suburban mom Carrie Hopewell married to DA Gordon Hopewell. Her oldest daughter Deva is actually the daughter of the mystery man. Rebecca Bowman rebels against her Amish upbringing to join her criminal uncle Kai Proctor. There are other criminal power bases in the native community and the neo-Nazis.This is unabashed pulpy goodness. There is sex, brutal violence, over-the-top action, and hard characters. The most unusual aspect is the brutal violence against women and by women. The show doesn't hold back with the blood splatter and the kinetic action. The characters are well-drawn and memorable. This is one show that knows what it is and how to do it."
"'I loved this show as the acting was hardcore, the violence was hardcore and the women were hardcore. It was a great show the likes which we might never see again.'"
"That's probably not my last comment about this tremendous TV show which reminds me ROAD HOUSE, WALKING TALL and some other stuff on this basic scheme: country side action and crime story. But that's all. For the rest, that's a typical new series where you will find nothing you may purchase in big screen pictures, about characters development - of course, you have more space and time to do it - and daring screenplay schemes, violence at a rate that, in for most cinema made films, it would be Parents Guidance rated. And that would not enhance the box office performance. But for home audiences, who cares if you have tons of brutality, that, on the contrary, enlarge, increase, the audiences and assure the show to continue beyond the first season? Take for instance a family father who wants to go and wee a brutal film in a theatre with his children; he can't, because the PG rating. But if he is at home, he puts the kids in the bedroom with a computer and he is quiet and comfortable to watch the film in the living room....It is important to understand the differences between big screen movies and TV series."
'Season 1: 6/10\nvery well made. tom hardy is a beast. not the most exciting show and a little weird at times but an enjoyable experience (1 viewing)'
"This is highly competent television, as competent as Vikings or Boardwalk Empire. Oddly I'd be more inclined to compare it to Vikings than to say, Penny Dreadful or The Frankenstein Chronicles, despite a difference in periods. Tom Hardy is perfect and highly charismatic. This is probably his best role since Peaky Blinders. His character corkscrews around in outrageous self-assurance whilst the plot delivers surprise after surprise. The sets are as authentic as The Frankenstein Chronicles or Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. The characters are Dickensian, but all seem to have a dose of Viking in them. The villains are very human by comparison, but have a whole lot more power and resources. This is a wonderful against-the-odds story. It's wonderful when a period piece such as this transports the viewer into a world that despite its age, appears new, fresh, even young.Importantly for a possibly seminal work, this series won't leave anyone hanging with a rotten cliffhanger at the end. All the same, if there is a sequel I won't be lax in jumping to see it."
"Firstly, Thank you BBC for putting a drama on for a Saturday Night, how many years has it been? Secondly thanks for making it something as special as Taboo. A few episodes in and I am utterly hooked, it is gripping, beautifully made, somehow cinematic, boasting wonderful music, glorious settings, and acting that is beyond impressive. Tom Hardy will always attract fans in their millions, his looks and talent make him a massive hit, I have a feeling we'll be seeing James Delaney for many years to come. David Hayman and Jonathan Pryce are both superb in their own rights. The trailers made this show look good, but in reality it is quite special, a period drama that is dark, gritty and wonderfully Gothic. I like that there is an air of mystery surrounding it too, can't wait to see how this unfolds. Do not miss this, you'll love it."
"So, what we have here is a game of blame. A blame game that pushes the responsibility for a suicide from the individual to everyone else, almost saying that the decision to off oneself is made by others.And then, as if to draw the biggest difference between Millennials and everyone else, it almost goes out of its way to say that people don't base their views on what everyone else thinks are wrong for being independently minded.The message is clear, let others think for you unto your death."
This is one of the best series i have ever seen. 13 reasons why is so heart touching and makes us thrilled in every single episode. Katherine as Hannah and Dylan as Clay had a very good chemistry and both of them did a decent job. Another best part of the series is the soundtrack. The background musics and the songs were just perfect for the mood of the series. All the leading cast did great with their roles. The cinematography is so good as every frame feel like we are in it. All 13 episodes are thrilling and at at the same entertaining. 13 Reasons Why is a must watch. Don't miss this series.
"If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!"
"Positives:\n1. Addresses, mostly from a teen perspective, bullying (w/suicide); social conformity & attracting attention; drugs/alcohol etc.; parenting; educational process including administration at the high school level.\n2. Acting & events/situations were just barely accurate, just overacted for dramatic effect.\nNegatives:\n1. Dragged on w/too many editing flashbacks; time filling trivial; needless over indulgent acting & made-up situations not likely to be seen at a school.\n2. Mentioned above the overacting & over-characterization for dramatic effect (made for TV so what to expect?) gives a misleading portrait of your typical high school behavior.\nMost importantly was the inaccurate portrayal of the counselor (and other school administrators, and teachers). Counselors & teachers have many legal impediments in terms of pursuing topics of a personal nature to students. They also are heavily restrained from physically touching the acting-out student even when said student is very disruptive or just a little harmful.\n3. Contrary to the movie's characterization most students are actually boringly good conscientious students. Although many know how far they can go to take up class time with talk & swagger.\n4. Next season they could go the gun angle since they showed a student w/a weapon; an unfortunate obvious topic. Or it may be too sensitive a topic."
"'Congratulations Netflix, You did it again!13 Reasons Why was so great in season 1 and should have ended there.\nThe series was dragged for a 2nd season, OK!, as long as Hannah was in it.But that, season 3, is such a mess, especially with that Ani ! that words are short of describing the situation.\nBritish accent, terrible look, terrible acting, terrible talking, in fact nothing is there in her favor, notwithstanding most ridiculous reasons and logic to shove her in the series in its 3rd season.Why should great series continue with nonsense scripts, be damaged to the core and milked bare until no greatness is left and only muddy and trashy memories remain..Please do yourself a favor and skip season 3, unless you enjoy constantly falling asleep while at the same time grinding your teeth noisily.'"

"The first series of Waller-Bridge's Fleabag was a legitimate comedy phenomenon - propelling her to international stardom, resuscitating the ailing BBC Three and breathing sharp life and fresh wit back into British comedy. Adapted from a one-woman Edinburgh play - Fleabag's fourth-wall breaking blend of filthy razor-sharp observational comedy and brittle humanity - centered around Waller-Bridge's vastly magnetic screen presence and what can only be described as the most shrewdly melded mix of editing, performance and writing ever attempted. I love it utterly and no praise is enough for what it does and what it is.Then, out of nowhere it got a second series and remarkably they manage to not only keep the tone going but actually build on it to reach one of the most bruised and cathartic finales in TV history. It's a gorgeous piece of work - all hands are magnificently cast (particularly the vastly underrated Bill Paterson who I've loved for years), it's a kaleidoscope of joy and pain. Do watch it."
"I'm still so annoyed with BBC3 for switching to online only, I still enjoy watching the show on my lunch break at work, but it doesn't beat watching it on the box.Fleabag is one of the best shows to come from BBC3 since the likes of Gary Tank Commander and Cuckoo. I don't get why a show like this isn't given a more prime time viewing slot, it seemed to be lost in obscurity and just deserved more.Some of the situations obviously are a little unusual to say the least, but the writing is just so good.Phoebe Waller-Bridge is proving herself to be an actress and writer etc of huge talents, Fleabag is genuinely funny, just as good as the recent channel four series 'Crashing' a project of hers I also loved. Olivia Colman can do no wrong, but it's nice to see her cast in a very different role, so often playing a 'sweet' character, she shows her versatility. Bill Patterson great also,"
"When I watched the first episode of Fleabag, I thought it was very funny but at the same time thought the main character was a bit off putting. But don't worry, her awfulness is mainly show.When I got around to watching the second episode, which was even funnier, I was hooked, and binge-watched the rest.Phoebe Waller-Bridge gives an amazing performance. She has a wonderfully expressive face which she uses to communicate with the audience, who she treats as a friend she's sharing secrets with. She can say everything with just a wry look or a moment of surprise.While Fleabag can seem like a sex-obsessed sitcom, the series insistently adds complexity to its characters. The main character is funny and bawdy, but also haunted by the death of a friend and traumatized by her upbringing. Her sister at first seems like a stock antagonist, but their relationship turns out to be far more nuanced, and the actresses' chemistry is remarkable. Even a bit part early on is given a chance at redemption.This is the first I've heard of Waller-Bridge, but she is an incredible talent. I just learned she made another series this year called Crashing, so I know what I'm watching next! (Update: I watched it, it was great)"
"Lacked subtitles for the elderly, disabled, hearing impaired, and ESL viewers. Disrespectful & cheap on the part of the producers especially when audio & enunciation is poor, and the varying British dialects. Dialogue is important!Main weaknesses: Trying to be cutesy clever by having actors talk directly to the camera. Second, usual hooks of alcohol & smoking to seem like just regular folk. Very pretentious dialogue. First episode was completely people just sitting around a table drinking & arguing. Usual social corporate gathering party including garden party scenes (both with food & drinks as the main props, of course). Usual search for romance. That's it."
"'If this review was just for the first season, the rating would have been four out of ten. However, second season was much much better. They lessen the unnecessary profanity and they kept it more real, about a problematic character in a messy family. The comedy was so so but the performances were really good. So, seven out of ten.'"
"'The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn\'t necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn\'t easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes. For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.Now I see there is a an untitled Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.'"
"'Starbuck ruined the show for me. Could barely watch her... No chance someone like that could ever stay in the military. Take it from all the bad reviews, the acting sucks... Whoever thought up the concept of the new cuss word frak or frakking was a good idea should be fired from any future writing gig. Good grief this show was just a hot mess. Im trying to watch the show as I write this and Starbuck just makes me want to scrape my eyeballs out with an escargot fork. So pathetic. Plunk plunk...'"
"'Sigh. Having read through some of the IMDb user comments, it\'s clear that the new Battlestar Galactica is another one of those cases where the audience is split down the middle, one side loving it to high heaven and the other hating it with a vengeance.I am one of the ones who love it, and I just can\'t understand the incredible bashing that the haters are giving the show. It\'s probably the best SF TV-show there ever was. Filled with strong characters, strong actors, strong writing and brilliant storytelling structure.Gaius Baltar is the greatest crazy scientist this side of Dr. Frankenstein; his increasingly schizoid personality is superbly rendered.There are only two things wrong with this show: One, we don\'t see nearly enough of Starbuck. Two, there is apparently no budget for the astronomical side of things - when they get water from an ice moon, we see nothing of it. We\'re just told that it happened. I wanna see some planets and alien environments! Come on, it can\'t be that expensive!But overall, an unspeakably great show with lots of story of a quality that doesn\'t insult your intelligence. This is fantastic space opera! History will be the judge, and this show will be utterly classic.My rating: 8 out of 10 - it was 9 in the first season, but I think the quality has trailed off.'"
"The mystery behind this show was very well thought out. During the entire series your trying to figure out who A is. That might sound like a boring concept, but as you follow the lives of the main cast; its extremely interesting. Unlike a normal high school drama, I find the series has more of an adult feel to it. The smaller stories within the big are extremely interesting that it keeps you wanting to watch more. The cast chosen for the show are very talented actresses/actors; they all play extremely well off of each other and do such an amazing job with their parts. The only reason I don't give this one a 10, is that the last season doesn't do the show justice."
"I remember watching this show in high school it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time trying to figure out who A was. It was so many loops the Liars had to go through before the finale showdown, I'm just glad I know who A is now."
'A fun if imperfect show. One of its MAJOR flaws is that it was driven a little too much by its fandoms. One of its bravest story lines at one point had former teacher Ezra Fitz as a possible A but due to the backlash it was quickly and quite badly backtracked. The same with Ali. Bad Girl Ali was one of the most interesting and entertaining characters on the show but by the end the need to pair her with good girl Emily had the show paint her as redeemed to the point of her being almost boring. That is and will always be the main drawback of the show. Forget the implausibility of many/most of the story lines. This was never billed as a very plausible show. It was a fun entertaining psychological thriller and stayed that way throughout. It was just that there were certain pairings that a large number of the fandom wanted as endgame most notably Ezra/Aria and Ali/Emily and writing into that made for some of the worst late series story lines. Still I would recommend the show to anyone who liked a good psychological thriller.'
"'Most do not know how close Germany came to winning World War 2.Declassified of the British Official Secrets Act (Law). After World War 2, the British discovered Two German Aircraft, that they designated the Heinkel 277, the bomb compartment only had one mount for one bomb of about 36 inches in diameter and over 6 feet in length.The Germans being meticulous bureaucrats wrote down everything, so much that they wrote all their War Crimes that they would be executed for during the Nuremberg Trials. Both of the Heinkel 277s had flown to and from New York City and Washington D.C. on more than one occasion undetected and were awaiting The Bombs one for New York City one for Washington D.C. according to captured German documents, that also indicated the Germans believed that the U.S. Atomic Bomb Project was located at Manhattan (New York City).

"If it wasn't for the Â« woke Â» madness and nail on the head symbolisms, the show would be really enjoyable. Unfortunately, it is filled with agendas and subliminal messages. The heroine, and her actress's mimics, are really irritating. Strangely enough, it also suffers from an extremely high level of fan pandering writing. And I sometimes feel like I'm watching some Â« ship era trend Â» show, where characters keep repeating how they refuse to be your usual clichÃ©. Only they are, just by desperately trying not to be. The horror/gore is silly. Making it perfect for Halloween, but irrelevant the rest of the year. Really, it has lots of resemblances with the original series. Only it takes itself too seriously, to be genuinely appreciated. Millennials in a nutshell... Oops."
A very entertaining show with a great lead and supporting cast. Bringing in the two actresses who played Sabrina's aunt's in the TV show (which I never watched) was a great Easter egg. But the finale was a downer and felt rushed.
"'Update:watch max 2 seasons of this show and Riverdale,or you will regret it,\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIm surprise at the satan related comments.\nnot as good as season 0ne True Blood or Dexter.\nI guess a mix of teenage to adult viewers demography .\nCan Have been much darker.\nrecommended .\nAlso watch German version of Dark.'"
"'This is a great show. From the Easter eggs referring to other horror movies and franchises, to the entire air of the show, the excellent cast, all add up to an excellent and fun show.'"
"So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!"
"'Season 1 was great.\nSeason 2 was brilliant.\nSeason 3 is a weak and woke forced diversity extravaganza! Weak on plot, poor antagonists, the best characters given very little to do, musical numbers and reduced to a teen romp.'"
'The funniest character is Malcolm himself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
"'It\'s weird to think that in the past 20 years, only FOX (of all channels) has aired any good shows: The Simpsons, The X Files, That \'70s Show and Malcolm in the Middle. The last one shows the adventures of Malcolm Wilkerson (Frankie Muniz) and his wacky family. Disorganized mom Lois (Jane Kaczmarek), uptight dad Hal (Bryan Cranston), impulse control-lacking older brother Reese (Justin Berfield), and over-imaginative younger brother Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan).Every episode that we\'ve seen, we\'ve liked. We particularly like how it shows the kids raising themselves while the parents have other things to do. Probably my favorite episode was where Malcolm went bowling. It had a split screen: on one side his mom took him and on the other side his dad took him. His mom proceeded to be a control freak, while his dad let them do their own things.It\'s quite an original show. So watch it. You won\'t be disappointed.'"

"Although I believe it has actually only been on TV for 5 years. What a roller-coaster of plot and emotion! Creator: Joseph Weisberg certainly had a winner on his hands and Keri Russell, Mathew Rhys, Holly Taylor, Noah Emmerich, and my favorite character Nina played by Annet Manendru brought this show to life! Anyone who missed this series missed a real treat of entertainment, mystery, thrills, and suspense!My only problem was this last season which (as I understand) is the end of the entire show. It went out in a quiet frenzy with our two main characters making an edgy yet unremarkable escape. Maybe I'm being too picky because I did not expect this to happen. Whatever, I did enjoy this show start to stop.Bravo!"
"'But this season truly was outstanding. It\'s been such an amazing year for TV, and I think this, Mad Men, Fargo, and Hannibal all stand on top of the drama pack in terms of their last seasons. I get why Hannibal won\'t make a splash with the Emmys, but how didn\'t Season 1 of this and how will it not again? Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are giving some of the finest TV acting, especially Russell. The characterization and plotting of this season is pretty impressive. Season 1\'s emotional core was the Jennings\' marriage, and this season was their relationship with their children, more specifically Paige. Seeing the new doors that the finale opened up, I can\'t wait for the next season. The show\'s truly found a perfect balance between all of the thrilling stuff and everything else around it, it never feels bogged down and it always gives enough emphasis to the characterization, in a way that could really test people\'s patience. Also, no other current show does musical montages like this one. Season Grade- AAlso, the ratings for this seem to be pretty awful, how the hell did it get renewed for another season? Regardless, I\'ll take it!'"
"Love, Death & Robots was originally going to be a feature length reboot of Heavy Metal; it's pretty damn stupefying knowing the path they ultimately decided to go with: an animated series of self-contained stories on Netflix where there are no true restraints on the contents of the stories or visuals. These stories are perfect trips for video game fans, sci-fi fans (like myself) and even comic book fans who just can't get enough of their far-and-wide alternate universes in fiction.Netflix is truly raising the bar for mainstream filmmaking, and this series shows that it doesn't conform to nostalgia-driven things like 'Stranger Things' all the time, but that even in an age where people love familiarity with their stories there is still a desire to see something new, inspiring and insightful. Love, Death & Robots is exactly that kind of ecstasy; it's an experimental trip that's both familiar yet satisfyingly new and bold. I'd say that my favorites would have to be 'Alternate Histories', 'Good Hunting', 'Sucker of Souls' and 'The Witness'. To be fair though, ALL the episodes are pretty good. They each cover their own respective genres just nicely.If you want to check out Love, Death & Robots but haven't gotten around to doing so because you're still yet to make up your mind, do yourself a favor and watch this pronto. It's a Netflix-Must!This Netflix-Must gets 4.5/5 stars."
"As i went through each episode i couldn't help but start predicting the scenes. The scenes werent only predictable they were illogical. Take for example Three Robots which had three robots on vacation traveling around taking vacations to see post apocalyptic civilizations.Two of the robots had mouths, one digital, one mechanical, both used for talking, but when they looked at human food they... nevermind. It isn't logical and it is a lack of attention to detail.Every episode had these logical errors which dragged down the story. So overall while the idea, the art, the motivation were interesting, the series of short movies failed to keep me entertained."
"SHEESH these robots are crazy.The fun anthology series returned with a second season. Similar to the first season, each episode has different animation, for the most part, and only one episode wasn't animated. Even though it's not thought-provoking and rich in themes like Black Mirror, I still love this series for its entertainment.And this second season wasn't different, as I enjoyed most of the episodes. The best episodes were the ones that had horror elements. They were adrenaline-inducing and intense in such a short amount of time. There was one episode that wasn't intense at all, and was more nonchalant and philosophical than the rest. This was my least favorite episode, as I found it weird and boring.Overall, the second season mostly gave me what I loved about the first season. Very entertaining. 8.5/10."

"Yep. Sometimes I have to log in, come here to the comments, and put in my two bits JUST because... a show or movie made me cry. This is one of those times.And even when a particular episode doesn't tug at those particular heartstrings, it winds up tugging at some others. And there's just not enough of that in popular media products, these days.Netflix is picking up the old narrative gantlets that traditional media money is now leaving to (otherwise) shrivel up and die on the ground. Good on 'em."
"'Death, where is thy sting?This well-written and well-acted show presents us with death from the perspective of a family-run funeral home. There is a Shakespearian element of having the ghosts of the corpses come and talk to the living characters. Chief amongst these is the patriarch of the family who has periodic conversations with his wife, daughter, and two sons.From zany fake commercials for mortician products to deadly serious issues such as hate-crime, the show has a wonderful range of moods and stories.'"

"'This has to be the most over-rated series in TV history,\nin the begging, 1st 2 seasons, I watched. It was OK with some moments.\nthere are maybe some episodes, or some scenes that were good.\nthe longer it was on, the more annoyed I got with this....\ndeath comes unexpectedly, which is to value life more.\nclichÃ©, everyone dies. death is never comfortable for the living.\nwhether unexpected or not.Mortuary is a good business. even in a recession. it doesn\'t suggest any proclivity or special interest in death. and I am sure one gets used to dead bodies. It\'s a family business.but as it goes on, it gets worse. and the same old theme really drags.\nand the girlfriend, who goes off the rails, I couldn\'t care less. and the dynamics are boring. and Dexter who I love later as D., so he is gay coming out is hard. yes we know.\nwatch it if you must, but it is just average at best; I think many actors liked it bec. their friends were on it, and the acting may be good. but again, that\'s hard to judge if you don\'t like the material.'"
"'When asked the question; what is the best anime, Death Note should be in the conversation. This show is GRIPPING. The viewer is almost always on the edge of their seat. The characters are very, very intelligent and capable in their roles.It\'s an awesome show.'"
"On the first 10 episodes, I thought Death Note was rather interesting and different. I have heard of it before until 6 years later, I went onto YouTube and finally got around watching it. Although as I watched the 10 episodes and the second Kira Misa appeared, I just lost interest. I even lost interest because they were still looking for the real Kira. I had to skip the 26 episodes and I got to the final episode. I was actually so sad that Light died. He was such a hottie good or bad. Omg his sidekick Ryuk was so creepy, every time he appeared, I had to look away. I know he's meant to be scary but for god sakes, he doesn't blink or show any emotions, it gives me bloody chills when a cartoon character looks like that haha! I wouldn't call this my favorite anime but I would call it an anime to remember!"
"Well, at least almost nothing. 20+ episodes is just way too much of pointless conversations in combination with more or less interesting twists. If it would have been condensed into half it could have been a good show. There is suspense, thrill, depth, intelligence and moral but also randomness, repetition, cliche and shallowness. Maybe I miss the point of my 1st anime series but from a pure entertainment side it's in my POV average at best."
"I watched first 6 (out of 37) episodes and I'm hooked. Although this type of animation goes on my nerves, it's not as bad as in other anime I encountered so far, and the story is so good that I have to see it through, no matter retarded looks of Shinigami and all the other flaws of the genre. This would be excellent feature thriller, either movie or series. If possible, in Japanese or European production, although I doubt even Hollywood could screw it too much. But, speculation on the side, in this form, I rate it8/10As the series progressed, I was more and more tempted to give it a 9, or even 10, but the last episode was a real disappointment. Someone who has been living a triple life for six years and playing the game at such a high level would not make such an amateur mistake. I knew they will get him eventually, but I was expecting some highly intelligent mindfak, not the outworn cliche of a villain exulting in the face of the enemy before his plan succeeded. Final rating8,5/10"
'This show has a long of Kid Friendly stuff and some Suggestive content'
This show is really awesome to be honest I grow with the anime as I'm encounter it as some distraction like every single episode of this anime have 5 to 10 minutes of flashback actually the flashback is not necessary to build the storyline it's actually distracted from the plot.
"'A group of intergalactic criminals are forced to work together to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Call me an apostate or what you will, but I do not think this is the greatest superhero film ever made or any of the other hyperbole going around. Is it a good story? Heck yes. Is it funny? Heck yes. And are the characters interesting? Heck yes. But it is also overshadowed by some mind-numbing special effects and lightning-fast editing that could be done without.Not to say this is a bad movie. It is not. At all. Among the Marvel films made so far, it is probably slightly better than average. Not quite on the level of the Iron Man movies, and definitely not as clever as the second Captain America, but far, far ahead of the disappointment that was Thor: The Dark World (though, to be fair, Thor is a bad character to begin with).'"

"Season 1: 3\nWhat i liked: the show is visually stunning. and the sci-fi concepts are beastly. what i disliked: basically everything else. it's a low quality show disguised as a high quality show because of how nice it looks. the acting is mediocre with some being really bad (like ortega). the dialogue is childish at points, and for some reason they switch between various languages without warning so you have to start reading subs at a moment's notice and i had to go back a bunch of times. and there are so many typical parts, cliches, and really dumb moments. i laughed a lot in this, all at unintended humor. the intended humor was terrible. but worst of all, the fight scenes were absolute garbage. except for one scene which was pretty good, the rest were abysmal. i'm talking 0 star fight scenes. you couldn't see what was happening at all. so many quick cuts and shaky cam. just absolutely awful. you know it's bad when i want to move past the action scenes to get to the boring stuff. speaking of boring stuff, so many parts i just wanted them to move past, like the emotional stuff between elliot and ava. and the story was ridiculously convoluted while at the same time being generally uninteresting. bad combination. yet another garbo showing from netflix (1 viewing)"
"A TV critic I respect recommended this. I haven't read the book it is based on.The CGI is terrific, the concept I am enjoying.Joel Kinnaman mumbles so I had to throw on the CC.First observation is that there are so many fight scenes which means massive grunting and no dialogue. That always disengages me from the characters and leaves me thinking: too many big words, let's throw in red lasers and masks and big huge fights. Interesting that 250 years from now the hero can't be pulverized into dust in a nano-second and that what looks like duct tape is still used to bind another character to a chair.I'm hoping it will improve and engage the intelligence a little more. I'm picking up on allusions to religions that don't allow sleeving which bothers me."
"DEADWOOD became quite overlooked at both the Emmy and Golden Globe awards, though it saw Ian McShanan anchoring his Al Swearengen an Golden Globe statue this series should proudly have strutted more awards after its three years run. You won't find a better TV-drama than this, surely we've seen Sopranos-commercial success and Six Feet Under's bizarre and highly original pull-offs, but Deadwood has an edge and guts that's truly, truly remarkable - the character performances for one thing is gold, Swearengen (the leading gusto) is nothing but stunning, his barbarous methods may be devil-sent, but his vision is even stronger as he staves off chaos controlling Deadwood. And although like other HBO-series say Sopranos or even more promptly, the Wire, the show is a slow-burning affair, the episodes are languorosly as they talk and talk, discuss, push & pull - but the narrative moves are so perfectly placed that it doesn't get boring for a single second. All of the Deadwood-citizens are making way for politics, education and culture, law & order doesn't steer Deadwood with its firm hand - Deadwood itself does, anarchy in a western-civilization in which everyone avoids chaos, but chaos is inevitable. Throughout its three seasons we see the Gold Rush Dakota-setting going from its giddy to its change of time, the Great West changing course. You faint of heart, cover your ears and shut your eyes - live fast, die young - Deadwood's in town."
"'/refers to Seasons 1 & 2/Together with Scandinavian (particularly Danish and Swedish) crime series, British ones are a sign of quality as well, I have not come across with any that is really annoying. True, their pace is slower and they can well do without constant shootings and chases, so there is a lot of focus on human psychology-relations-background.Still, it is always good when there is a novel depiction mode or interesting intertwining - as we can see in Broadchurch, where it seemed after Season 1 that Season 2 should be based on a) totally new case b) events followed by an escape of the suspect. But the witty combination of and references to an unsolved earlier case make Season 2 even more gripping and versatile. Apart from skillful direction and camera-work, there are also very good and realistic performances (no one chosen by just a cute looks and no one sticking unnecessarily out due to his/her fame), and wonderful beach and sea views forming a complex entirety and creating an atmosphere so becoming for such a series. Thus, another good viewer experience, recommended to all those not regarding human and family matters as spoilers on the way of thrill. But one should watch all episodes in succession and definitely begin with Season 1.PS Season 3 is another thrilling creation, with versatile references to Season 2 and distinct solution of the crime.'"
"This is one of the most incredible television shows I've ever seen. At the beginning the story comes into focus very quickly and the rest of the multi-episode show takes the viewer on a long roller coaster ride where we meet a cast of characters in a town like many others, with varying degrees of virtue and vice, covering a wide spectrum of British society. In truth, it could be anywhere. The mood is dark and psychological forces are at war. The town where this movie takes place could be anywhere and yet it seems like a place we all know because it exposes the secrets, the paranoia, the fears of being caught amid the casual friendships and veneer that we call everyday life. Dark music accompanies the progress of the show as we see one person after another cringe with fear as to where the next blow will land. Yet, we also see how human nature can rebound and lost souls can rally together and forge unity when crime pulls people apart. David Tennant, Olivia Colman, Jodie Whittaker, and Andrew Buchan are outstanding in this series. There are no heroes, only victims. If you want escapist entertainment, don't watch this. However, if you want to find out how we react when the social order seems to become unhinged as the result of a single crime, this show will deliver superbly."
"Watched 6 episodes, mostly on 2.0 speed. i basically hated it from the first episode. network garbage. western and sci-fi tones don't mesh well. corny jokes. terrible action. cult following my butt"
"'I won\'t spend any time here discussing the horrible way this show was marketed and broadcast--resulting in an early cancellation--except to say that I was one of the original viewers and I felt betrayed.Firefly is my favorite television show of all time.The basic premise bears some resemblance to Star Wars, but FF does it better. The music is great, the production values are great, the set of the ship is fantastic. The cast is terrific. But what really makes this show is the writing. The characters are truly developed and nuanced, far from one-dimensional. The plots are intriguing and different. The universe of FF expands throughout the first season.The guest stars deserve special mention. There were many portrayals worthy of Emmy nods (hello, Christina Hendricks!). Joss Whedon had created such a wonderful first season, if the show had continued, there were so many story lines to build on. I think FF would have been an Emmy factory.'"
"Firefly has a huge cult following, and I can see why. Had it been allowed to grow and develop, it could have turned into a fantastic series the way Buffy did (whih actually had a much weaker first season than this). As it is though, it's just really good, although it does hit greatness various instances. The characters are pretty fantastic and episodes in you really feel a sense of family, something Whedon has always been great at doing. It also helps that the cast is up to par, there's no weak link to be found and makes ranking them that much harder. I still have yet to see the film but I hope it doesn't disappoint, and I hope Netflix does something to bring this back."
"Nathan Fillion as Capt. Reynolds is probably one of the coolest characters to grace your TV screen ... although he wasn't there long enough for you to enjoy him. And it's a shame that the show got axed so early.The problem the executives might have had with this TV show, is that they couldn't market it. They didn't know how to advertise the series, so it got under the radar. Not completely, because still fans watched it, but the decision not to air the pilot first was a fatal one. Even if the first episode (after the pilot movie) was a recapturing of the characters that you should've known already, it's not the same.I bought the DVD box set, because of all the buzz it was getting from the internet. The acting is great, the dialogues are a joy to listen to, the stories that are told with the character development (yes the characters do develop, even if at times only a few inches) are superb. If you like your comedy to be well written, the dialogue witty and funny and don't mind the mixture of Sci-Fi and Western, than this show is definitely something you should watch!"
"GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a fun and light-hearted superhero romp from Marvel. The setting is outer space and the film is a sensory overload at first, featuring an unknown cast of colourful alien beings interacting in a standard storyline involving the possession of a magical, world-destroying device. The first thing you notice is the quality of the CGI effects, which as in the recent DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES, are quite remarkable and photo-realistic for the main part.The hero of the piece is Chris Pratt, nowadays hot property but an actor I can take or leave. He does his usual cocky routine, but the supporting cast are much more interesting: Zoe Saldana takes a similar role to her one in AVATAR but has a lot more fun, while Dave Bautista is hilarious and even Bradley Cooper's raccoon character is lovable. Groot isn't quite on the same level as Treebeard but is still amusing, and you have to love others like Michael Rooker's larger-than-life space pirate. The plot is derivative and predictable, and the spaceship action scenes are still copying STAR WARS some thirty-plus years later, but the camaraderie is good-natured and, more importantly, funny. The result is a light and breezy movie that never loses momentum, and leaves you happily looking forward to the sequel."

"I really don't get all the great reviews. And 6 seasons of having to watch so much stupid characters? Not for me thanks. I love comedies, not the ones who get stuck on stupidity. Watched 5 episodes of the first season and gave up."
"The first season was interesting and even with some logical errors in the script I continued to watch. However getting half way through the second season I started to see a pattern with the script. Whomever was writing this crap just kept spreading the story too thin. It was as if they needed to stretch stuff out because they didn't have enough content to make the episodes interesting.There are too many deus ex machina devices being used. The characters are supposed to be these amazing geniuses in the field of computers but they end up being morons. Too many episodes where they do stuff which isn't realistic or logical. Too many contrived scenes which feel like a square peg being forced in to a round hole.The predictability of the script was terrible too. I could watch the opening scene and then skip to the ending and miss nothing in the middle.I ended up stopping towards the end of the second season. I couldn't handle the predictability of the characters or the overacting, the terrible dialog or the lack of logic. A good analogy would be like watching Family Guy which often uses filler scenes of Peter farting for sixty seconds."
"'Years ago, I used to work for my government, and since that time I have maintained some interest in related issues, and that is why I tend to follow political series from different countries. True, I am selective in this, trying to avoid the depiction of blunt superiority and propaganda, but names like Guggenheim and Sutherland have been a sign of quality to me.Well, the US series have usually certain angles, approaches and topics not self-evident in other countries, but if you know then beforehand, you just accept them as an integral part and realise that you cannot expect the same attitudes and themes as e.g. in Borgen (Denmark). Run of events and characters in the White House seem plausible, the outcomes logical - bearing in mind the PresidentÂ´s forced evolution and tragic benchmark. Well, the events related to Agent Wells tend to be more action and not always compatible to what is going on arond Kirkman, but they are noo too disconcerting. Despite the Season 2 is less interesting and versatile than 1, it ends in a way that suggests the Season 3 - but not coming according to the latest information. So the all thing remains incomplete, without proper round-up.All in all, it is no House of Cards, but thanks to K. Sutherland and K. Penn, above all, it is pleasant to watch. And when taking account into current US president, then perhaps a guy like Kirkman would be more becoming option...'"
"'In Designated Survivor, Kiefer Sutherland plays Tom Kirkman, the Secretary of HUD who is sworn in as President when the U.S. Capitol is bombed and the leaders of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches are killed.When voters evaluate Vice Presidential candidates, they consider how they might fill the presidential role, but no one evaluates the Secretary of HUD that way. One of Kirkman\'s first tasks is to project authority and adequacy. Sutherland\'s usual whisper-talking has a gravitas that is suitable for this problem.The show deals with the problems within Kirkman\'s family, who are moved into the White House immediately. It also deals with the struggles within government as Washington tries to regain equilibrium, political and otherwise. Lastly, the bombing has spurred challenges to American authority and resolve on a global level. Can Kirkman respond to these challenges? The irony is that he may be better suited than the two major candidates now running for the Presidency in the real world.Though conflicts and crises often unite people, the situation on Designated Survivor--being focused on Washington D.C.--quickly devolves into political gamesmanship, unprincipled and illegal, though totally believable.The acting on this show is excellent. My one wish is that the show can maintain a viewpoint that is not politically biased. After three episodes, it has done a fair job of that.'"
"If it's entertainment you want, Designated Survivor fits the bill. It has tension, suspense, intrigue, explosions, downhome family scenes and oodles of that peculiarly American schmaltz where everyone loves their country and is just doing his job, sir, just doing my job and which turns off a good many Brits like me, I have to say. And this Brit is also turned off by the somewhat formulaic nature of it all.This, sadly, is once again drama by numbers, the kind of thing you have seen often before and will see often again before you pop your clogs. And if it's nuance you want, subtlety, ambiguity, something pitched a little higher than just 8pm evening fodder, go to The Leftovers, Boardwalk Empire, or one of several other excellent series which have hit our screens these past few years. There are too many plot holes, too many occasions when you ask yourself 'but why did she/he/it do that? Why notÂ? And there are to many clichÃ©d characters - clichÃ©d liberals, clichÃ©d foreigners, clichÃ©d journalists. So if you want clichÃ©s... But as entertainment, Designated Survivor will do, and do just fine.That isn't, though, meant as much of a compliment."
"I had my doubts about this show at first, but now I feel it's the best political drama TV series.Right off the start I was annoyed by Kiefer Sutherland's 1960's eyeglasses... really, wardrobe came up with that idea?Anyhow, I got used to them and more importantly very impressed with Kiefer Sutherland's performance as well as the entire cast.The writing in every episode is amazing and the directing and cinematography is on point.Every government should use this show on how it should be run and how a president should act. That said, Kiefer Sutherland for President!A perfect TV series I hope has endless season. 10/10 from me!"

"'I think the audience for Se7en is rather self-selecting. If you don\'t mind an ultra-gory cop film with a lot of expletives, then you will be delighted. If you are looking for something family-friendly or \'nice\', then you wouldn\'t even consider watching this in the first place. While I don\'t think I\'d put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn\'t a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it\'s natural I\'d get to it sooner or later.As for the film, I won\'t say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it\'s the sort of thing you\'d normally watch, watch away and enjoy.'"
Oz is one of the best shows that I've ever watched on TV. The show is full of realness and actucally scares me of going to prison. Every episode you watch leaves you hooked wondering what is going to happen next. Aside from all the gayness which makes me want to vomit this is a great show.
"'To say it is the best serie is real easy. and fair. and risky. because it seems be a revolution of genre. not stories but a large puzzle. not characters but cases, relations, teams,, business, revenge, the prison portrait in a cold, realistic and bitter manner. and Rita Moreno in one of the memorable roles of her career. Oz is special and it is not any way to demonstrate that. it is enough to see it. episode by episode. for know. it is an experience. than a serie.'"

"'Truly inspired cartoon comedy about title character, an undersea fast food fry cook with interesting work- and play-mates. Hits paydirt on many levels while rarely offending or shocking, and deftly combines fantasy and everyday elements in its stories. Has realistic, funny, and what they would call richly-textured characters. At one point I would have put this in the 10 classic television productions of all-time, having over-dosed on the DVDs of the first season I may have mellowed a tad since then. In case you were wondering, I would include in that top 10 list (in no particular order) Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, The Avengers, The Prisoner, The Dick Van Dyke Show, M*A*S*H (early episodes only), Seinfeld, Monty Python and probably a couple of dramas I never fully appreciated. Deserves kudos for closing the TV show before completely playing itself out. 10 out of 10'"
"As a kid who grew up in the early to mid-`90s watching cartoons like Ren & Stimpy, Beavis and Butt-Head, and Rocko's Modern Life. This is a cartoon that is similar to those but not as daring. The new generation of children have a different taste from mine so the cartoons today are obviously different and I can understand that but with a cartoon like SpongeBob it is nice to see a cartoon that represents those of my generation. This is a funny cartoon and who can forget the episode where SpongeBob and Patrick were cursing. Hilarious!"
"'I grew up watching this cartoon and I have to say I enjoyed it. My favorite episode was Frankendoodle. I thought the first 3 seasons were the best. After Hillenburg left though, like many people I felt that the seasons seemed to lose their charm with each episode. They weren\'t bad but I felt like something in the humor was missing. Instead of clever puns or gags they decided to just use gross-out humor which if done right can be funny but now it\'s just overkill. Most of the characters seem to be one-dimensional now. Also Spongebob\'s more annoying due to his even more high pitched voice and antics. It\'s amazing how oblivious he is to things sometimes like a pet he brought home named Puffy Fluffy who turned out to be a monster despite Gary\'s warnings.With that being said it\'s not bad but it almost seems like a shadow of its former self. The animation\'s brighter and better but the stories seem to be hit or miss. It seems like some of them aren\'t really finished or even recycled from previous episodes. If you have little kids they\'ll enjoy it just fine. If you\'re a fan of the show still more power to you. Dive down underwater and see for yourself.'"
Sponge Bob and Square Pants i think wasn't a bad series. This all began in 1999 and now it has ended with the series in 2002. I thought this was good but i prefer all the other series such as the simpsons and the rugrats. I give this programme 7 out of 10.
"Copied the Sopranos with the nagging wife and two brats for kids that are a pain to watch every time that they are in a scene.\nRay is carrying this whole show and as soon as the story lines start to filter out into his brother's, the family and father things get unwatchable fairly fast.This show should have been cancelled after the mess of Season 5. Fans had to petition for it to continue for Sea 6 and again for Sea 7. No luck for an actual ending and Season 8 as the producers probably couldn't figure out a decent enough ending. Good thing. As bad as this was crashing I'm positive it would have ended much like the Sopranos in a restaurant, with nothing happening, and a black screen for 40 seconds."
"'This series began with a cool premise: a Hollywood fixer who cleans up after the messes of the elite. Unfortunately, they barely touch on that and instead have made it the worst kind of soup opera imaginable. I can\'t believe people like this. Who is the target market? I cal this dwelling on family members as the Meadow Soprano Syndrome after that series went overboard on dissecting the lives of the most uninteresting people under the sun. And who the f**k cares? It\'s just an excuse not to have a plot with an actual story.Ray Donovan\'s inner circle is made up of everything from a priest-diddled brother to another punch-drunk moron of another brother, to a loud-mouth idiot of a wife with a very phony Southie accent, to a gay kid, and an adolescent daughter that should have been put to sleep instead of forcing her on viewers. Did I miss anything? That was just the first season. I stopped after that. So if you are looking for something with almost no action but heavy on really stupid family drama then this is for you.This could have been such a cool series if they had stuck with the action. I could think of ten good stories to pursue as far as his cleaning business is concerned. Instead, they went telenovela.'"
I've watched close to the entire series and even though it go's far out it's done well. The entire family becomes rounded and you end up caring for the characters. It's a very intense series and thrives in constant trauma but not like a soap opera (which I can't stand). It's not an upbeat show that's for sure but it's done so well that I stuck with it. Solid
"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichÃ©d characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time."
"'Ray Donovan (perhaps with not the best choice of title) is another fine example of recent trend when crime series have become more interesting and meatier than crime movies. Lots of acclaimed actors, intertwining characters and events, and twisted twists make such series interesting to follow - but, for the sake of full comprehension, you should have time and opportunity to watch all episodes in succession. All this applies to the series in question, where the cast is evenly strong (well, Jon Voight as Mickey Donovan and Liev Schreiber as Raymond Ray Donovan stick out still), and the situations and relations get complicated a lot, without becoming airy-fairy, and the nature of Ray\'s duties and his big family enable to deal with dozens of different mini-scenes. Perhaps too much for some, but I personally liked to follow what happened in different places at the same time. Moreover, in many situations, I could ponder on and over complex issues, how/if I could resolve such a situation, and have some sympathy with characters even when the situation was unpleasant or even rude...Good job, and I am looking for the next season already.'"
'So I first rated this an 8 which felt perfect but as time has passed the visuals and production have stayed with me the show managed to create an experience -it was an experience to watch this.\nI experienced ( it was a feast for the eyes ) and many of the less Integral messages have also stayed with me . The production was excellent'
"'It seems possible that Netflix presented the writers with algorithm results from their viewer rating system and said, OK. Here\'s the budget. Here\'s what our viewers in this demographic want. Go write a series. Frankly, I expected better from Tykwer and The Wachowski\'s. The star of this series is its cinematography. That earned my vote, which would have been much lower without it. The cast is a mixed bag. Miguel Silvestre, a.k.a. Sex-on-a-Spoon, is not only amazingly photogenic but perhaps the most talented. Aml Amen, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt carry their weight in that order. Jaime Clayton is in way over her head. It\'s hard to watch her squeeze out an emotion at times. And who doesn\'t like watching a skinny girl, played by Doona Bae, kick bully ass? Now that\'s entertainment. The plot 1s part Twin Peaks, part Twighlight Saga and part mishegas. The pseudo-science is really obnoxious at times. The concept of yet another superior subgroup in human society wears badly, especially when these special people blow less special people up or shoot them in the face. But they sure are a sexy bunch, and that\'s what really propels this series. It\'s a hedonistic pleasure, like all the recreational drugs that are seemingly admired by the writers.'"
"Well this was beautifully done. The sets, the cast, the imagery. They could have done with a little less , I can't believe I am saying this , but visually it was a lot to take in - i am so visually appreciative when it comes to shows and how do I say - this was stunning (but for me) too gratuitously so. It pushed the bounds of my comfort level. I have to give it the solid 8 I liked the characters, became enmeshed in their plights the story was a good one , the filler was the best ever really but somehow I felt there was money and talent to create these over the top montage type (Isn't the word but like that) scenes) i I give it a solid 8, pardon the pun it was well done but I had trouble suggesting it. Not at all because of the political it whatever you call it tendencies if characters etc that was reasonable and I liked the representation of the many cultures and people , it was elaborate in that way. I mean what more could I want ? It had everything!"
"'I\'m sorry but I couldnt even make it through the first episode with everybody humpin around! I\'ve never SEEN a show with SO MUCH sex! And you think they\'d be trying to draw in viewership in the first episode!!! But by the time I cut it off, I\'d already seen 3 instances of sex, a guy humping a wall, a couple having sex, and 2 women having EXTREMELY EXPLICIT sex!!! I thought I\'d rented this from the back room of the video store!!! Needless to say, I was HIGHLY offended by the amount of sex, if a writer has to pad their script with THAT MUCH sex, then they have NO confidence in their writing skills/ storyline. I thought this was supposed to be some big, innovative series, but I can see now why it got cancelled so quickly! I would have cancelled it after the first episode! The storyline is just WEAK, the acting SUCKS, the locations are great, but that won\'t save them from the sinking ship. This is the S.S Sens 8 Titanic!!'"
"The creator of this amazing show is a true visionary.He brings to life the vision of a greater future of connectedness, acceptance and unity in a way no other show I've ever seen does it.I'm not gonna go into the story itsself, many other reviews have done this.All I want is ask: What prejudices do you and I have? In what ways can you and I get rid of these prejudices? Why not be open and curious instead of hatefull and narrow-minded?ps: The -1 star is for the massive overuse of slow-mo kissing scenes and a rushed, but thankfully still enjoyable and somewhat satisfying finale."
"'Grimm is one of the coolest representations of Portland. Like Portlandia, it shows the City of Roses at its quirkiest. The focus is a police detective who is a descendant of beings who kept a balance between humans and mythological beings, and so he can see monsters who appear as humans to everyone else. So whenever there\'s a string of bizarre murders or kidnappings, he knows what\'s up. With the help of his lupine friend, the detective keeps Portland safe (and weird). Meanwhile, there are secondary story lines that reach all the way to Austria.It\'s just a really good show. It demonstrates that when Hollywood puts its mind to it, it creates shows that are worth watching. I think that you\'ll like the show.PS: Another Grimm is a Dutch movie about a pair of siblings who escape a dangerous situation a la Hansel and Gretel...only then it turns out that the main part of the movie hasn\'t even started.'"
"'Sure it is a Science Fiction show. But it is like fairy tales that pop up and come out for real, literally. As Detective Nick Burkhardt is a homicide cop who finds out he is a hunter called a Grimm who fights supernatural forces, one of the last of them in line.He fights down creatures that are usually called Wesens. Despite being friends with Monroe, played by the great Silas Weir Mitchell who is one of them.In addition to his great job, and a great partner in Hank Mitchell, played by Russell Hornsby. And an understanding captain, Sasha Rotz also a Wesen. He has a lovely fiancÃ©e named Juilette played by Bitsie Tulloch. All three did not know about his real nature of a Grim until later in the second season.He had his mom fight with him, an original Grimm played by movie actress Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.It is like fairy tales that are coming to life there.'"
"Grimm was entertaining and fun for the first couple of seasons, when it focused on the simple monster-of-the-week stories. Unfortunately too many story-lines about the powerful royal family of vessen, the reapers, the vessen-grimm politics, and the vessen-killing military cult got introduced. The show got ridiculous and annoying.Nick's wife became a central figure, a lot of insanely off-the-rails things happened to her, and her character was a big drag on the show, in my humble opinion. Claire Coffey was another character that became a drag because she was sleeping with every main character and having kids with them and Grimm became a soap opera about sleeping around, pregnancy clinics, parenting training, and family dynamics.The last couple of seasons were really hard to watch. Grimm became Dr. Phil's Monster Families."
I just binged both seasons and if they don't make another season I'd be absolutely fine with that.The cinematography is excellent and the performances are consistently brilliant.The plot is weaker than a dead wife's fragile torso.It tries to be sociopolitical instead of just telling a story.It breaks off into so many unnecessary tangents that I found myself not caring what happened to most of the characters.Just give me a Mad Sweeney and Dead Wife road story and bin everything else unless you plan to use Crispin Glover properly.
"A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later."
"Of course Parasite could be anything ... which is why you should avoid Spoilers at all costs. Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it.If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"
