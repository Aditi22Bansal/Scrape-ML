'It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (LÃ©a Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no Diamonds are Forever. And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn\'t they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'
"'No Time to Die is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch James Bond living as a pensioner but this will change very soon. Bond has to face a new mysterious villain along with many surprises that he would never even think.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an interesting plot that connected very well the previous James Bond movies and presented equally good both the old characters and the new ones. Its long duration did not bother me at all since there was plenty of action along with many good interpretations by the cast. The direction which was made Cary Joji Fukunaga was simply amazing and he did an excellent job. Regarding the interpretation of Daniel Craig who played as James Bond, for one more time he was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were LÃ©a Seydoux\'s who played as Madeleine, Rami Malek\'s who played as Lyutsifer Safin and Ralph Fiennes\' who played as M. In conclusion, I have to say that No Time to Die is an amazing movie that if you are a fan of James Bond movies I am sure you will love it.'"
"NO TIME TO DIE (2021) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Magnussen, Christsoph Waltz, David Dencik, Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah. Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor."

"It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent. Still, that message works better if the storytelling convinces us of that point instead of assuming we'll just blindly agree with it."
"So after watching the original Venom in 2018, I found it to be pretty good & enjoyable! This sequel, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, which was meant to be released last year, finally comes & to be honest it wasn't bad!The film follows Eddie Brock & his new buddy companion Venom as he tries to navigate life with him! But when a super villain also gets a new buddy companion called Carnage, polar opposite to what Eddie Brock has does it get real & it's up to Eddie Brock & Venom to stop him & his girlfriend with super screaming powers!I found the film to be pretty good! It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10."
"Denis Villeneuve's Dune is not a perfection because it's still a preparation, a very very well made preparation, a perfect build for what i hope is gonna be a massive and incredible war, more incredible than the original 1984 Dune, Denis Villeneuve's Dune also fills with an amazing performance by all the cast, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is for me something special because the movie can keep me personally awake for 2 hours and 35 minutes and for a preparation movie with a very little big action scene it's very impressive, compare to Avengers Infinity War (which is another preparation movie to Avengers Endgame), Denis Villeneuve's Dune is mostly talking and it's work, is it better than the original Dune? Well, that's a joke for me because even the first 10 minutes of the film is already better than the original and the whole movie completely is not finish, overall, Denis Villeneuve's Dune is an incredibly well made remake yet not finish but it's worth to watch and worth to wait."
"'The visuals are sometimes stunning but there are great issues with this version: the changes in characters just feel very wrong - if you know or are used to the original material (I read Frank Herbert\'s books quite a few times, and Lynch\'s Dune is in my opinion, despite some flaws, a masterpiece and ways stronger than this new work, even the cinematography is in my view more original and fantastic, not to mention the way stronger and more interesting cast).Villeneuve\'s Dune may be a modern reinterpretation of the material and will maybe satisfy a younger audience or people who do not know the books (well), but for me it is more or less just a visual spectacle (like so many movies these days) with some profound changes (to characters, plot etc.) but without the right heart, mind and soul, and the greatest issue: a lot of the complex source material just gets lost in some sci-fi visual spectacle. Verdict: certainly not bad but rather mediocre pop-corn cinema stuff, because missing the depth of Herbert\'s fantastic epic sadly by far, but for sure there are lot of worse ways to spend 2+ hours of your lifetime.By the way - that Imdb is flooded right from the beginning by fake reviews and countless max rates, tells a lot.'"
"'This film is delightful to watch! It is fun, engaging and upbeat. The visuals are fantastic. I enjoyed it a lot.'"
'4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.'
"'I quite enjoyed this. I like the Scarlett Johansson Romanoff character from the MCU, and together here with Florence Pugh (Ok, so Yelena Belova sounds like one of Ian Fleming\'s innuendo-ridden Bond girls) the two have a blast tracking down the evil General Dreykov (a terribly wooden Ray Winstone) whom, it seems, has been masterminding some super-power laden sleeper cells in the US of A for quite some while now. It is only when their parents - David Harbour and an oddly miscast Rachel Weisz are rumbled and they all have to flee to Cuba that we discover the modern-day machinations of our evil baddie and when the sisters reunite after an absence that is never really explained - baddies beware. Like so many of the Marvel films, it\'s escapist nonsense - it\'s not there to challenge our views, beliefs or our politics, it\'s a very well produced vehicle for a star who gives her all each time and who may be many things here, but is never boring. The action scenes are plentiful, but they are not as frequent or as enduring as in many films of this nature, and though I will readily admit to finding it far too long, i did find it worthy of a big screen occasion - even if I will probably never watch it again.'"
"I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."
"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it\'s an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung\'s who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh\'s who played as Ying Nan, Meng\'er Zhang\'s who played as Xialing and Awkwafina\'s who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.'"
"Have been anticipating this film since Halloween 2018 which I found to be a bit of a let down & lacking, but when I heard of this film, I was hoping for it to be better & boy did I get it!The film continues on the events from the last film directly & sees the whole town of Haddonfeild clubbing together to take down the monster Michael Myers for good!I found the film to be good, ok, not quite as gory, but still pretty damn close to it that's for sure! The violence was pretty epic for what it was & the scares were ace! Yes, there's no focus on a specific character, but hey who cares!? The story is simple also & straight forward, that's not an issue! Moreover is the fact that the film continues on directly after the film & sort clears uyp loose ends & back tracks to 1978 also which was good! The violence & body count are revved up in this sequel & put the 2018 film to shame! The eye candy is good also!Overall it's an ace sequel! Don't listen tot eh haters, watch it for yourself!9/10!"
"James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight."
"In a research hospital in 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver faces a growing threat from Gabriel who seems to control electricity. She is forced to order ending him. In present day, a pregnant Madison Lake (Annabelle Wallis) is slammed against the wall by her angry husband. A mystery figure kills him and she wakes up in the hospital. Her supportive sister Sydney Lake (Maddie Hasson) tells her that she lost her baby. Police detectives Kekoa Shaw (George Young) and Regina Moss (Michole Briana White) investigate.James Wan comes home to horror. I like the backward facing killer. I don't find the mystery that compelling. More than anything, it's a bit confusing more than compelling. At the end of the day, I kept thinking that there is one easy solution... suicide. The movie never has the daring to approach that subject matter. It was always in her head and that's where the battle was going to be won or lost. The electricity is some odd X-Men addition that seems out of place. On the other hand, I do like the visual dreamscape transitions and the over-the-top action. It's crazy enough to work. There is a lot to admire from James Wan but ultimately, it feels a bit empty."
"Is the red hot case in this movie that i underestimated at all levels before viewing, if you search the wikipedia for relevant information on the true facts you will be impressed how the writers and directors have spun a trully develish endaring parapsychologic gory horror thriller story like taken outta the 1980's best ''thing''ishly made products.What i admire most of all is the use of enerving background music that makes your goosebumps scream '' dont turn your back to it'', and the mix of special effects and brilliantly made scene staging, the use of light and dark, sound effects and bloody gory physical fights that will linger your vegetative nerve system for all its worth and may shake your abundant teratomas back to life, like ripley said,''believe it or not.There are some black holes in the timeline of the story, and some intriscic factors that youll find hard to add up when watching, but i was simply overwhelmed by the scare factor that becomes so dominant all the way from the start.Acting is not the top notch on the hyperbel curvature, but still good enough to make you think ''ive got to see this one more time, at the cinema''. So if your in for shock and awe and a little bit of a mental freakshow, do as the grumpy old man did, view it . A big recommend and still searching for my teratoma."
"'I went into this movie blind, which definitely made my experience better. I had a good time. It has some cool ideas and concepts that make me think. I was into it throughout. And it has some very creepy and memorable scenes. I was debating between a 6 (good) and a 7 (awesome). Gave it a 6 for now, may change it to a 7 on second viewing (1 viewing, 7/26/2021)'"
"I have read several really bad reviews about this film, and the last film or two I watched from Shyamalan were average at best, but there was something about this film that I did enjoy.It flew by, it wasn't slow or dull, nor was it particularly scary, instead it relies on the primal fears many have (self included) about the ageing process, and the passing of time, if you are someone who has the slightest worry of time passing, this will resonate.The location work is awesome, and the production values are superb. Great acting throughout, it's always great to see Rufus Sewell's cheekbones.Not sure if it was my ears, but I found some of the dialogue a little muffled at times.All in all, this was good, 7/10."
"THE SUICIDE SQUAD (2021) *** 1/2 MARGOT ROBBIE, IDRIS ELBA, JOEL KINNAMON, JOHN CENA, DANIELA MELCHIOR (the voice of SYLVESTER STALLONE), DAVID DASTMALCHIAN, VIOLA DAVIS, MICHAEL ROOKER, NATHAN FILLION, PETE DAVIDSON, STEVE AGEE. Filmmaker James Gunn gets his ya-yas out in this go-for-broke kitchen sink epic taking of the cult DC Comics characters including in Robbie's hell-yeah Harley Quinn and Elba's morose Bloodsport forced to go on a secret mission with a melange of oddballs to thwart a worldwide threat in the form of an alien creature being housed as a military weapon in the fictional Corto Maltese. Totally bonkers and a ton of fun the ensemble motley crew is gonzo for destruction, mayhem and sure, saving the world at any means possible. King Shark is the wild card voiced by Sly as a man-eating cuddly great white in Jams.Have at it!"
"Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is back with the Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) blackmails Bloodsport (Idris Elba) onto the team. Along with Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2, Polka-Dot Man, King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), and Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the group is tasked with infiltrating the island state of Corto Maltese after a military coup to take out an alien starfish.This is a sequel to Suicide Squad (2016). James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt. It makes it hard to build a continuing narrative for the franchise. This is a great stand-alone movie although the franchise is a different question."
"Okay so cruella was actually kind of amazing. The cinematography and costuming were breathtakingly beautiful. The storyline took a few weird turns, but for the most part really worked. The characters were well cast and well acted. The Emma's slayed being maniacally deranged."
Anyone who thinks that Fast and Furious has gotten way over the top with stunts and what not ... well wait til you see this. Just the beginning alone takes the cake ... not the car chase per se ... but the stunt out of that ... scene. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.I guess it sets the tone. And then we get Mark Wahlberg. Depending on how you feel about him ... you will love the rest of the movie or loathe it. I was ok with it ... he has some really interesting over the top scenes and stunts. Well his character does. Add to that some really good actors ... or funny ones ... and you have an intriguing if flawed movie. Could be worse ...
"'Infinites are people who have achieved a form of immortality through reincarnation. They have split into two groups in a battle of good versus evil. Evan McCauley (Mark Wahlberg) has always have knowledge beyond his experience. He forges a sword for a drug dealer in exchange for illegal meds to keep his sanity. He gets arrested and attacked by Bathurst (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He is saved by Nora Brightman who brings him into the world of the Infinites.This seems to have an intriguing elevator pitch. It\'s the story of reincarnation as a superhero movie. So the start seems fine. The drug dealer, the police station, and the epic escape are all fine. Once the movie starts doing expositions, it completely stalls. Wahlberg starts reverting back to his Wahlberg mannerisms. It\'s the blandest of action thrillers and the most bombastic. It takes any hint of original concept and turns it into forgettable non-descript action.'"
"'There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism.'"
"'At Christmas, the enigmatic Green Knight arrives at court and challenges all to fight him. If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though.'"
"'The Green Knight is a Drama - Fantasy movie in which we watch the classic Arthurian legend The Green Knight. Sir Gawain who is King Arthur\'s reckless nephew starts a quest in order to face the eponymous Green Knight but first he will witness some weird facts on his journey and he will evolve as a person and he will better define his character.I have to admit that I did know the legend of The Green Knight before watching this movie. The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury\'s who played as Mother, Sean Harris\' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander\'s who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie\'s potential. To sum up, I have to say that The Green Knight is an average movie that failed to reach its high potential of becoming a great movie. Nevertheless, I recommend you to watch it because I believe that you will enjoy it but I suggest you to be patient with it.'"
"'Greetings from Lithuania.Promising Young Woman (2020) is one of the most daring movies i\'ve seen in some time. This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won\'t forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to movie for me. I really liked it, but it wasn\'t like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, Promising Young Woman is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise. The more it revealed the more i felt for our main character. Here is a one movie you won\'t forget soon after seeing it.'"
"'Fennell\'s execution puts her female identity at the forefront, not a masculine film masqueraded by a female director holding the rein, like Kathryn Bigelow\'s THE HURT LOCK (2008), PYW basks in many tropes from female-fronted genres, a combo of sororal slasher, silly romance (dancing to tunes of Paris Hilton\'s STARS ARE BLIND in a drug store, noughties pop gems is Fennell\'s blatant manifesto of girl power!) and oddball comedy (Cassie\'s birthday gift from her parents is a modish suitcase), with the appurtenances of Fennell\'s fabulous choices of decor and palette, it is a girlish-looking movie, but its thematics are grave, urgent, important and PYW makes a cogent case of it.read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks'"
"Let it be clear, Promising Young Woman is a good movie. Is it Oscar worthy? In my opinion it's not but that's just me. It's a revenge movie. The kind where you hope justice will be done, if possible with a lot of suffering for the guilty persons. I can't help it to be a bit disappointed in the revenge parts, but overal justice is served. Carey Mulligan did a very good job playing her character. And so did the rest of the cast. The movie is easy to follow, and even though the story is sad there are not really scenes that are too graphic. Maybe some more graphic scenes would have made this movie even better but again that's only my opinion. Promising Young Woman is certainly worth watching, some men could learn a lesson from it."
"CANDYMAN (2021) *** Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Teyonah Parris, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Colman Domingo, Kyle Kaminsky, Vanessa Williams, Brian King, Miriam Moss, Rebecca Spence, Michael Hargrove. (Cameos - Tony Todd & the voice of Virginia Madsen) Nia DaCosta's imaginative reboot of the 90s slasher flick updates the vengeance seeking demon with a Buppie couple (artist Abdul-Mateen & curator Parris) setting up shop in the bougie new confines of the mythical Cabrini-Green projects of Chicago where the urban legend of the titular spirit is resurrected when the painter begins to invoke the bogeyman for his own personal interests, unleashing a bloodletting as well as a nightmarish discovery. Executive produced by Jordan Peele - who co-wrote with DaCosta and Win Rosenfeld - the effective production design and atmospheric scoring by Rober Aiki Aubrey Lowe pairs incredibly with the handsomely shot cinematography of John Gulesarian employing effectively the dread building up ."
"Again, totally blind into this Netflix just been told, watch it, it is good. And so it was.I just came back from Tokyo and it was shot in the district I stayed so I did recognized a few things, like the Godzilla head for example, And Lawson, and the sound of the red lights...memoriesKate is a pure revenge flick, exagerrated as there are so many at this moment. In fact, if you did like Nobody (2021) then you surely are going to like this one. And if you are into Yakuza and martial art, well, this is it.It's brutal, and bloody and messy. There's of course CGI, used for the car chase, also over the top but hey, it's so typical for these flicks.Kate is out there on flix, it's number 3 in my country so it does say a lot.Gore 1,5/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 2,5/5\nStory 2,5/5\nComedy 0/5."
"Kate(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a hit women living in Tokyo, suddenly realizes that she was poisoned, and has 24 hrs to avenge it, and does not care how many bodies she has to step on to get to the person responsible, but will she before it's too late?Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a pretty good performance as tough hit woman with no mercy, but then shows she also be very vulnerable. The girl Kate teams up with is also great. Woody Harrelson brings his boyish charm as V, Kate's father figure boss. Kills are quite brutal, and fight scenes are quite intense. If you are into that, please give Kate a look."
"'And a dozen other productions, shamelessly. Just like civilization in 2021 -- total chaos.'"
"The movie has a great story director and cinematography but it is too much lengthy for court drama movie as always Amitabh sir's, Emraan Hashmis and everyone acted greatly."
"In summary my wife and I, grandparents, enjoyed this musical movie as light entertainment. It uses a lot of mostly contemporary songs that are actually sung by the cast. Most singing is pretty good, some of it not so much, but it does fine for this type of movie. It is mostly funny, at times absurd, with elaborate production numbers.The biggest divergence is both the prince and Ella are, in different ways, reluctant to accept the traditional roles. He isn't sure he really wants to follow his father as King, she isn't sure she wants to be a wife of a King, maybe being a dress designer would be more fulfilling.Right after release on Amazon streaming this movie has received lots of unjustified, very negative reviews. It isn't a bad movie, in fact it is very well made and interesting for any viewer in the right frame of mind. It isn't my type of movie, I'll probably not re-watch it, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. A rating of 5 or 6 is probably just about right."
"'I had a good time watching Jungle Cruise because the thrills just keep on coming. As someone who likes adventures on reel, Jungle Cruise met all my lofty expectations: mythology and legend, a smart-aleck skipper, an Englishwoman and her sweet-faced brother, and the Amazon rainforest. Give it a go even if you are not familiar with the Disney link.'"
"So, some Pirates of the Caribbean, some Jumanji, some Mummy, some Lara Croft, some Indiana Jones. . . . But . . . I really had fun. Dwayne was Dwayne ;) I think the casting was good. I really enjoyed. Yes I agree, it wasn't a good movie but what did you expect? This is a popcorn movie.7 out of 10."
"I think this is quite a fun adventure. They repeatedly hinted at the guy's sexual orientation in the film, but it wasn't followed up in the end, which is a pity. Would have been nice if he got together with someone too."
"'I had never heard of the Jungle Cruise ride until I heard of this movie, and that Disneyland was removing racist caricatures from the ride (well, they kinda have to at this point).As for the movie Jungle Cruise, it was what I expected. Lots of action reminiscent of every adventure movie of the past forty years, and no shortage of CGI. Very much a summer movie. Sure to entertain the tykes.'"
"There's a lot of action in the film, from guns to sword fights. There are times when the plot is not so convincing, such as when Akiko trusts snake eyes all of a sudden, or when snake eyes can fight with a sword skillfully on a motorcycle. It is nonetheless entertaining."
"'Wrath of Man had three strong ingredients: a solid central character, plenty of action, and an intricately crafted screenplay.Jason Statham is first-rate in the role the man known as H, which is short for Mr. Hill. His real name is Mr. Mace, but the names do not figure in the intensity of the action.The best scenes were those involving a fleet of private armored trucks of the Fortico Company. The opening sequence sets the stage for H infiltrating the company, landing a job as a security agent, and seeking revenge for the death of his son Dougie.The script effectively doubled back to reveal what happened to Dougie as a bystander during the film\'s opening scene. The bereaved dad stoically plots his revenge by piecing together clues about the perpetrators. Led by an operative known as Sarge and the trigger-happen Jan, the team, of course, is no match for H.The secondary characters were well-developed, especially the operative named Bullett. The associate of H named Kristy could have been fleshed out more completely. But the film succeeded in delivering good location footage around L. A. and, above all, solid action around armored trucks and millions of dollars in cargo.'"
"Amazing storytelling jam packed with action. The cinematography was beautifully done, the way you're given different perspectives of the same scene, is so well done. The story unfolded in a captivating and compelling way. The acting was decent and the action coordination felt authentic."
"'I saw Escape Room:Tournament of Champions, starring Taylor Russell-Words on Bathroom Walls, Lost in Space_tv_2018; Logan Miller-The Walking Dead_tv, The Bling Ring; Deborah Ann Woll-The Punisher_tv, True Blood_tv and Lucy Newman_Williams-London Has Fallen, Everest.This is a sequel to the 2019 minor hit-it cost $9 million and made $150 million-so with numbers like that, there was bound to be a sequel. If you are missing the Saw movies, this should fill the gap. It puts people in escape rooms where they have to solve puzzles to get out and continue along to the next test. Taylor, Logan and Deborah are survivors from the first movie and get roped back into the games. Lucy is a therapist that Taylor is seeing-because of the events in the first movie-that is trying to get Taylor over her fears. Taylor & Logan get on a subway train and the games begin anew. They also find out that 4 other people on the train have been through the games before so that\'s why it\'s called the tournament of champions. The ending leaves room for a sequel-if they make big bucks.It\'s rated PG-13 for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes.It\'s a little better than the first one with more elaborate traps-probably because of a bigger budget-but I don\'t think I would buy it on DVD. If you liked the first one, this would be a good rental.'"
"Nicolas Cage (Robin) is electrifying in Pig much better than a lot of his oddball roles! I don't think it's much of a thriller except a few parts, more of a drama that is quite impactful on emotions and crystal smooth writing. I'm offended a couple people I talked to thought Pig was a name for someone no it's actually about the animal which was so well filmed in every aspect! I wasn't sure why people were so mean to Robin but he handled it all superbly. I absolutely loved this movie, I highly recommend it to anyone."
"After being delayed for a year because of the pandemic, this sequel to A Quiet Place finally came out. This marked the first time I went with my movie theatre-working friend to watch a movie in two years. Good thing we did because this was as thrilling and entertaining as the original one. John Krasinski is once again writer and director and appears in the beginning sequence which takes place before the first movie. And his wife Emily Blunt is also there and, along with the two players playing her teen children, make compelling performances throughout along with some other players that we haven't seen before in the original. I'll just now say we both highly recommend A Quiet Place Part II."
"'Now, as sequels go this is not half bad. Building on the well crafted 2018 film, we take the story of the Abbott family still in hiding from the deadly alien locust like creatures. Still grieving, mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt) must try to keep her remaining two children Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and Marcus (Noah Jupe) as well as their newly arrived baby out of the clutches of their nemeses. Forced to flee the relative safety of their home, they hook up with neighbour Emmett (Cillian Murphy) and attempt to reach safety on an island that the invaders (who cannot swim) have yet to conquer... This picks up well on the tension left at the end of the first film, the characters are already established so John Krasinksi doesn\'t have to waste time reimagining them. Aside from a slightly distracting recap demonstrating how their current predicament started, the feature moves along apace with plenty of tautly directed action that presents both of the younger actors with opportunities to shine - and that they do. Unlike many follow-ups, this expands the story giving us plenty to hide behind the sofa from; an extra character from Murphy that adds to the threat nicely, and though I didn\'t enjoy it quite so much as the original, it\'s still a fine piece of cinema.'"
"Don't Breathe 2 didn't need to happen but with the way the first ended I'm happy the story was continued. It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one. Stephen Lang did so great as the blind man that has to deal with a new group of home invaders and a little girl he care-takes. Love or support my thoughts I highly recommend Don't Breathe 2 to horror fans!"
"Following Batman v Superman, Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) are searching for more heroes for the upcoming battle against Steppenwolf. They recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and The Flash (Ezra Miller).Is this better? On a basic level, yes. It's not chopped up and corrupted by a different chef. It gives each hero more background. The scenes are not cut short. Even Steppenwolf looks better. It fits Zack Snyder's vision better in style and in color. This four hour extravaganza is Zack Snyder's definitive version. That is also why it wouldn't have been shown in theaters. My suggestion is to split it up in two but it's hard to place the break. The obvious story break is bringing Superman back to life but that happens well into the second half. Now that it's on HBO Max, one should probably split it up into a few sittings. It's a heavy lift, and I had several breaks over two nights. There is only so much overly crowded CGI and slow-motion pose-a-thon that I can take. Nevertheless, I still appreciate that it's his style. The tone is serious with Ezra Miller providing much of the humor. It's not the quip train from a Marvel movie. This is a war between Gods with all the good and the bad. The grandiose can be overdosing. It is very much Zack Snyder."
"While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films."
"If you haven't watched Nobody yet, do yourself a favour. Best movie I've seen in ages That's not my words it's someone else's but I totally vouch for him. He's never sold me a dud movie."
"'The Father is a contemporary example of what was formerly called Kitchen Sink Drama--a gritty slice of life unvarnished and raw. Sir Anthony Hopkins delivers a magisterial performance as a man suffering from dementia and occasionally recognizing that he is a prisoner in his own mind.The central, heartfelt relationship in the film is that of the old man and his daughter Anne. At times, Anthony treats her badly, and the filmmakers deftly deliver the experience of a daughter struggling to cope as she contemplates sending her father to a nursing home.The fragmented way in which the narrative and characterizations shift gives the audience an experience of a crumbling mind. Anthony confuses names and details as he desperately seeks an answer to the question, Who am I?It wasn\'t entirely clear if the filmmakers wanted to depict an experience of elder abuse, as the two men who were in the flat as Anne\'s husband would berate and even physically assault Anthony. Still, Hopkins is successful in carrying the film by evoking a Shakespearean figure of tragedy. It is quite simply an unforgettable character portrait.'"
"After his previous carer leaves the daughter of an octogenarian, Anthony, organises a new carer for him. However, to Anthony everything is confusion: faces change, one day his daughter Anne is moving to Paris, the next day she's not, is this his flat or not? And why doesn't his other daughter visit him anymore?Brilliant. An absorbing, sensitive-yet-jarring look into what a person living with dementia or similar must go through plus what those that love them and care for them must experience. Told in a very intriguing and compelling manner: nothing is signposted, everything unfolds in a layered altered-reality fashion, making you figure things out for yourself.Quite haunting and thought-provoking, as that could be you one day, or someone you love. Incredibly emotional too as you think about this affects his loved ones, the life he's lived and that this is what it now amounts to.Incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the lead role. While the plot and direction are fantastic the film needed an excellent performance as Anthony and that's what Hopkins does, absolutely nailing it. He well deserved his Best Actor Oscar.Great supporting cast: Olivia Colman (who got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her efforts), Rufus Sewell, Olivia Williams, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss."
"'The devastating effects of Alzheimer\'s disease (although never mentioned by name) on an aged ex-engineer in London. There is no conventional story in The Father, and that\'s as it should be. Director Florian Zeller, who also co-adapted his 2012 play Le PÃ¨re with Christopher Hampton, gets inside the deteriorating mind of the central character with astonishing skill (although it takes about 15 minutes to get into the movie\'s rhythm). Anthony Hopkins gives an incredible performance; his confused, frustrated Anthony is delusional, forgetful, obsessed with time, unable to distinguish the past from the present, and prone to nostalgic bewilderment and angry fits of befuddlement. We, too, are lost in time as people Anthony is introduced to are either figments of his imagination or are substitutes for whomever is trying to communicate with him in the present. It\'s a moving journey through a trap-door existence, though the operatic pieces by composer Ludovico Einaudi are a tiny bit excruciating (less so if you admire the genre) and Zeller tends to overdose on weary-eyed closeups of Olivia Colman playing Anthony\'s conflicted daughter. Six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Hopkins as Best Actor. *** from ****'"
"Anthony (Anthony Hopkins) lives in his large London flat for much of his adult life. He's showing signs of dementia as he falsely accuses others of stealing his beloved watch. His caregiver daughter Anne (Olivia Colman) tells him that she's moving to Paris to live with her new boyfriend. His world is disjointed and confused as unfamiliar faces push into his life.It's a fascinating artistic vision of what dementia must feel like. When Olivia Williams shows up, I thought the movie could go in two interesting ways. The new people could be scamming the old man which would be very daring in terms of writing. It could also be a psychological Kafkaesque horror with ever-changing faces. The movie tries that but it's not pushing the Kafka feel enough. This is an interesting movie with some very interesting actors. Maybe the early part of the movie had me expecting too much. I end up reviewing what's not on the screen rather than what's on it."
"'The problem with this is you haven\'t the faintest idea as to what the thing is about until so late in the day as to have long since even up... Hugh Jackman (Nick) runs a sort of laboratory with his pal Thandie Newton (Watts) that has a big bath into which folks can go an relive their memories for a few hundred bucks a pop. One day, the beautiful Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) arrives, into the bath she gets and poor old Nick is hooked... From here on in it\'s not quite clear whether we are in the past, the present or the future - was she real, is she real - is he, is any of it - and most importantly - do we give a monkeys? Sadly, his obsession wasn\'t mine - and I lost interest. There are some fun scenes - especially for fans of lethal fish, but for the most part it is a good looking but rather uninteresting story that gives us precious little context at any stage that might enable us to opt into his fixation. Nobody\'s best work.'"
'This was one good Sci Fi Noir filled with some good acts and some good story potentials .Hugh was likeable while Rebecca was visual threat.'
I don't know what the deal is for a video game adaption this Mortal Kombat is the closet thing to accurate in my opinion. Got to see this in RPX which is an exhilarating theater experience glad I didn't watch on HBO it wouldn't have been as epic! I absolutely love how brutal the fights/murder scenes were. Some of my reviews don't get enough appreciation so at least take the positivity from me.
"Gunpowder Milkshake is beautiful, I crave the amazing cinematography and to top it off the action is awesomeness! Girl power movies are usually so damn good I'd say 65% of the time. The music is god tier throughout I really like it! Karen Gillian is perfect as a professional killer. I don't use Netflix as much as most but I wish I saw this sooner."
"Gunpowder Milkshake tries too hard to be a stylised female John Wick. It needed more inspiration instead of ripping off Hong Kong action movies.It also lacks the heavy duty gunfire of John Wick and the playfulness of Keanu Reeves.Sam (Karen Gillan) was abandoned by her hitwoman mother Scarlet (Lena Headey) some years earlier.The older Sam has followed in her mother's footstep by becoming an assassin for her boss Nathan (Paul Giamatti.)When a job goes wrong. Sam needs to look after a little girl and get help from three women who were her mother's comrades called the librariansThere are some nice touches such as the diner shootout. However the story is thin, the movie overlong and Michelle Yeoh is the real standout when it comes to action."
"'Fear Street: 1994 is a Mystery - Horror movie and the first movie of the Fear Street franchise, in which we watch a group of teenage friends trying to solve a mystery behind a series of brutal murders that frighten Shadyside for more than 300 years.I enjoyed this movie because it had a very interesting and mysterious plot. The only think that I did not like were the unnecessary jump-scares but thankfully were very few so, they did not ruined the image of the movie. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak was very good and she presented her main characters very well along with their history. In addition to this, she did an excellent job on the way she connected the history of Shadyside with the present time. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Kiana Madeira who played as Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Kate, Olivia Scott Welch who played as Samantha Fraser and Fred Hechinger who played as Simon were very good and their combination as a team worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that Fear Street: 1994 is a nice horror movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of horror movies.'"
"'I had never heard of the Fear Street books before watching this movie. What was particularly interesting was that, like Stranger Things, Fear Street: 1994 looks at the class differences. It\'s nothing great, but I did like it, and I\'ll be eager to see parts 2 and 3.'"
"'Movie tries really hard to pull on some heartstrings wich may be a little offputting. But overall a very nice story with human aspects. Acting was ok, some slipups but overall good. Overall a fine movie with some really good story elements.7/10: yes.'"
"This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.Director Sian Heder knocked it out of the park with extremely laser precision on-point direction. Specially how he had the actors who played Ruby's parents react to the singing at the high school. Everything was so on point and believable. Emilia Jones was outstanding. Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved. It was one after another, freaking fantastic scenes.The only con I can think of was the title. Why an acronym for such a beautiful film?SOLID 10/10 and screw the haters. This film really deserved the 10."
"SiÃ¢n Heder's 'CODA' is a heartfelt crowd-pleaser that hits all the right notes. While the film utilises many familiar tricks, it is a picture with compelling performances from a great ensemble and boasts a well-crafted and well-executed genuinely uplifting story about family and people who care deeply about one another. An emotional powerhouse."
"'Luca is about a race of merpeople??? Luca (Jacob Tremblay) is a young Italian merman/merboy who dreams about life on the surface. His parents, Lorenzo and Daniela Paguro (Jim Gaffigan and Maya Rudolph), however, are deathly afraid of the surface and don\'t want Luca anywhere near it. Luca defies his parents with the help of another merboy named Alberto (Jack Dylan Grazer). When he gets to the surface he finds that he becomes an air breathing, tail-less, human boy. He enjoys every minute of surface life, but he has to keep his true identity secret if he wants to stay safe from the townsfolk who are afraid of sea monsters.I enjoyed Luca. I knew the moment would come when he and his friend Alberto was discovered, but it wasn\'t as dark and ominous a moment as I expected. Even with the somber message, Luca never got too down and depressing as I\'ve seen some other animations get.'"
"We've been saying ever since the purge that Frank Grillo is a star, he should be a lead in a franchise. A BIG franchise. The whole cast was excellent mel gibson is always great. I have to say though my favorite part was hearing the GREATEST band EVER!! BOSTON!!! THE MOST UNDERRATED UNDERAPPRECIATED band of all time!!! Listen to brad Delp's incredible voice, tom Schulz incredible guitar and the most positive music EVER!!! We miss you brad delp!!!!best action movie this year....By far!!"
"I hesitated watching this movie, because the story was so ridiculous and I didnt much like some of the really gross bloody scenes (not suited for below 16!). But half an hour into it, I did get the hang of this violent story and started to like it more...The good: the computer game like action is fantastic and over the top, with some really gruesome scenes that made me look away though (extracting your own teeth!). But all the violence is portrayed in a lighthearted, funny way, just as in a computer game, so I could cope with the gruesome violent scenes. More good: the story (however ridiculous) does have a really nice twist to it, that is rather charming. To top it of, Mel Gibson is back in a great bad guy role, with some cool oneliners and a couple of good jokes. This is simply good old fashioned action fun, with many great looking special effects!Any bad? The leading actor looks like a B-movie hairdresser, without any charisma. But who cares, this is a computer game movie, with only macho fighting stereotypes. It's all about the fun of continuous figthing scenes with a lot of gruesome killings...The story: fight, fight, fight. A man has to relive the same day, every day of his life. And that particular day just happens to be a day in which he gets attacked by dozens of assasins! Will he ever get out of this repeating killing maze?"
"'This film start with a video game layout, and the main character Roy killing the man Mr. Good Morning try to attack him scene! As turnout, this film is about a woman Jemma created the so called Osiris Spindle to let Roy save her from a villain Clive! Entire film full of intense action scene! Such as, car chase scene, car crash scene, bloody shooting scene, sword fighting scene, bloody slicing scene, bloody stabbing scene, things broken scene, and explosion scene! Make the film quite watchable! At the end, after saving Jemma, Roy going into the Osiris Spindle to stop the time loop! That\'s it! Another must watch action film!'"
"It is intense and suspenseful. It doesn't use jump scares, which is impressive."
"'NOT funny. And just as a reminder it is suppose to be funny.Perhaps very young kids could like it, but then again this movie has got a PG- 13 rating so that wont be a possible market. And I simply cannot imagine any teenager having fun with this sort of NOT funny comedy, because it is so terribly childish.If you are an adult, simply pass this one by...'"
"I liked it, I don't love Adam, I even have my reservations about these American besteroles, but seeing a hot ex-avenging and winning is comforting, and the movie, although very stupid, is fun pathetic, and ridiculously funny... Worth the time invested..."
"'The bad:\nSeen these kind of action thrillers before. They are pretty much all the same. There is nothing new to this story either and there are a few pretty implausible plot turns, that prevent it from becoming a spectacular thriller. BUT it is still a rather enjoyable action thriller, for those whose demands are not too high...The good:\nThe acting is pretty good. Angelina Jolie is still beautiful at her older age and she still mesmirizes me with her acting skills. The other actors aint bad either. Despite some predictable and implausible plot turns and despite a predictable happy end, there is still enough action and suspense to keep me entertained. Rather impressive firestorm photography tops it of...The story: Angelina Jolie protects a kid who witnessed a murder, during a firestorm. Will they survive both the fire and the killers who are chasing them? Duh...'"
"Well its a film where smeone gets pursued and tried eliminated, the only problem for me is to figure out why???. Try it yourself and you may feel the same. Is it a political inspired take out due to reduced budgets on a federal scale, and howcome the film starts in florida with a person that you arent given any background stuff about less than he has a brother in law out west, montana working as a police officer there... well the plot and story aint the best unfolded one, but its kind of chilling, much thanks to a rush of nonstop action, killings and pursuits with some decent acting all over. I think the actors doing the ''take em out'' roles does a real good effort , acting as a crook agent or whatever, some are just born to be sly when acting...so if youre in for the firefight there aint any fight, just a fight for life and fight against ptsd. So grap a ticket while its still hot and available in the theater, cause the rush of adrenaline is the proclaims the grumpy old man, with a recommend."
"'Forget about hate speech. The movie is very enjoyable, the cast is great, the script is terrible, the acting is great, the comedy dose was good, the bad words as always ;) I found what I expected from the movie. It was pretty fun.'"
"'If you know your greek you will recognize this tweaked version of a Scarface quote (the 80s Scarface that is in case you have a very well versed film knowledge). Another thing to know: the film features a lot of foul language and a lot of violence. Is there a big story behind it? No this is more about shooting cool stuff, explosions and quotes to take home.As a Greek I sort of almost wanted the villain to succeed. Of course not really because after all he is bad and evil, right? But it was nice to see a Greek bad guy for once - and very well established and sawn into the financial crisis and into general history. And while it is not an actual Greek playing that role (Papadopoulos or Papad..less as he is also called by Sam Jacksons character at one point), Antonio Banderas is not only a great actor who is great, he also learned or knew some Greek words he threw in there for good measure. Always a nice thing to hear that and while it may only be a minor detail, it is something that is much appreciated.Also his history with Salma Hayek makes this almost meta. Not to mention a cameo that I wasn\'t aware of, that has a funny scene with Samuel L. Jacksons character ... his voice may be one of the most recognizable ones ever.So this is case of style over substance ... but in a very good way.'"
"'Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek reprise their characters in this sequel to the action comedy The Hitman\'s Bodyguard (2017). In a rather more convoluted plot that adds Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman to the list of characters, this sequel does not really break any new ground, but does pull together the elements of action comedy in a bit splashier way and incorporates a decent dose of emotional backstories and somewhat more personal intimate scenes that add a nice balance to the action comedy. The threat to the European Union is quite a nice new spin on mass destruction. There are a few places where the movie threatened to become an unintended parody but pulled itself out with experienced acting. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable summer movie that offers a little mental attention to follow the plot and the relaxed luxury to join in the visual and auditory physical action, the light-heartedness, a few poignant moments and come out satisfied if not exuberantly and amazed.'"

"'Space Jam: A New Legacy is an Animation - Comedy movie in which we watch a new version of Space Jam of 1996. Instead of Michael Jordan there is LeBron James who has to work together with Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win a basketball match and not letting artificial intelligence achieve its goal.Since I had already watched the first movie of Space Jam I knew what to expect from this new version of it. The direction which was made by Malcolm D. Lee was average without achieving to intrigued audience and make them feel that they are also a part of this movie following his main characters. The interpretations of LeBron James who played as himself, Don Cheadle who played as Al G. Rhythm and Cedric Joe who played as Dom James were good and their combination worked pretty good. To sum up, I have to say that Space Jam: A New Legacy is an average comedy movie and I advise you to lower your standards if you want to watch it otherwise you will be disappointed.'"
"'After 25 years since Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes appeared together in Space Jam, another reboot or remake of the franchise was made in Space Jam: A New Legacy. It stars LeBron James, who tries to chase Michael Jordan in the GOAT (Greatest Of All-Time) conversation, just proves once again that he is not him on and off the court especially with poor acting unlike Jordan,who was clearly having fun in his role in the original.It was apparent the comparisons will be made compared to the first movie released in 1996. While the digital and visual effects are a lot better, it proves once again that LeBron does not have the marketing appeal that Michael has. That is why you see a lot of ads(from LeBron and Warner Bros) implied on the film and focused on it rather on the story it has.Well, this movie was released to capitalize on both stars being the best of their respective generation\'s NBA players. Too bad that this movie proves once again that LeBron is not comparable to Michael even off the court.Take note,I am not even a Jordan fan. Wilt Chamberlain is the true G. O. A. T (Greatest Of All-Time) in NBA History. Hands down. Not LeBron nor Michael.'"
All I'll say is I told you so...Last Words: It's complete hash.
"'This movie delivered as promised, Godzilla and King Kong duking it out. The storyline was a bit far fetched... but can you really expect anything less? All things put together it was pretty good, the cgi and cinematography were amazing to watch.'"
This is the fifth film in the Purge franchise and a direct sequel to 2016's The Purge: Election Year.This one has ample amount of action but somehow the tension is missing.I still enjoyed it. The sun soaked settings added more fun n it was good to see Josh Lucas aft a long time.I was hoping for an exciting showdown in the end but alas.
"It's definitely derivative and it almost certainly has some issues with the choices it takes in the last 15 minutes, but The Little Things succeeds with tension, atmospheric creepiness, and the performance of Jared Leto. I think we all would have hoped for a little more from the 3 of these leads, but it still contains some fantastic cinematic moments.6.9/10."
"Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best."
"'Emma is a subtle comedy, delving into issues of marriage, sex, age, and social status. It was the last book of hers published while author Jane Austen was still alive. About the character Emma she said, preparing to write the novel, I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.Emma is 21 and privileged, she fashions herself as a matchmaker and most of the stories that develop result from this. It truly is a comedy of manners. Not slapstick comedy, the type of subtle British comedy.This movie pretty well follows the novel and Anya Taylor-Joy to me is just perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She is a good actress but I especially love to look at her face, with her wide-set eyes and perfect lips. Strangely after she was selected to play the role she was hesitant, she said she didn\'t think of herself as attractive enough. In fact in an interview she said, I have never and I don\'t think I will ever think of myself as beautiful. I don\'t think I\'m beautiful enough to be in films.Bill Nighy is very good as her wealthy father Mr. Woodhouse and as often happens when he has a supporting role, Nighy steals every scene he is in.Good movie of a familiar story, I enjoyed it. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.'"

"'I really enjoyed the invisible man, it was a different kind of thriller and it works. Elisabeth moss slayed as the leading lady, developing well throughout the film and delivering a killer ending. The acting was good, the storyline development kept a good pace, and the action scenes awesome. Really enjoyable thriller.'"
"'Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) flees from the isolated mansion of her husband, the awarded physician Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen), with the support of her sister Emily Kass (Harriet Dyer) during the night. Cecilia claims that Adrian is an abusive husband and EmilyÂ´s friend Police Detective James Lanier (Aldis Hodge) lodges her at home in the room of his daughter Sydney Lanier (Storm Reid). When Adrian surprisingly dies, Cecilia inherits his fortune. But when weird things happen with Cecilia, her sister and friends, Cecilia believes Adrian is invisible but not dead and is sent to a psychiatric clinic. Is Cecilia insane?The Invisible Man is an absolutely overrated film. The screenplay is not good, with many plot holes and with poor development of Adrian Griffin and Cecilia Kass, performed by Elisabeth Moss, looks like a crazy and unbalanced woman most of the time. The viewer never sees the claimed abuses of Adrian and how Cecilia finds that he is invisible in the beginning is a great mystery. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): O Homem InvisÃ\xadvel (The Invisible Man)'"
"Cecilia Kass (Elisabeth Moss) escapes from her controlling partner Adrian Griffin to her friend James Lanier and his daughter Sydney. Two weeks later, she is surprised when her sister Emily comes with the news of Adrian's death. Adrian's brother Tom is handling his estate which leaves Cecilia $5 million. Mysterious things start happening and she suspects Adrian's hand in the matter.I was intrigued with taking the invisible man to the horrors realm. The start needs to give Adrian more time so that the movie has a firmer grasp on its villain. When the situation starts to turn, I get the feeling that the tension is not quite high enough. Looking at an empty room for the invisible man is intriguing for about two minutes. Then I realized that I already know the cause and therefore there is no mystery to the movie. Also, it's unlikely that the dead man is the automatic suspect. I'd go with Tom first and she should be investigating Adrian's death. James is possibly the worst cop ever. A lot of it could be set up with more of Cecilia and Adrian's relationship before the escape. The ending is also problematic. Being over two hours, the last bit should be cut for various reasons. The premise remains intriguing but I would change a few things."

"Nomadland won three Oscars and it's well deserved even though I wouldn't say it was the best motion picture of that year, or the best directed one but that's just my opinion. Frances McDormand though deserves her Oscar. She's an actress that always delivers and in Nomadland she looks so natural playing her character that it almost looks like a documentary. Some of the rest of the cast are actual nomads, living from day to day, from one place to another, far away from the rat race, and that's what makes this movie stand out. Watching people living completely different than what the norm is supposed to be is just entertaining. I applaud people that do their own thing, sometimes by choice but too often because society gave them no other option. It's a hard life, but when you think about it I'm almost sure those nomads are happier than anyone else. The idea of camping in the most beautiful sceneries, it's a luxury some pay a lot of money for every vacation. Living like this is a choice and it seems like the best choice if you're fed up with the mass consumption society where you need to produce all the time, just to fit in. Nomadland is a good movie, maybe not the happiest movie, but certainly food for thought."
"It delivers. It doesn't limit itself to be just an action/drama/revenge film, it gives important lessons about choices, about relationships, about grief and about forgiveness.Once again, Mads Mikkelsen has a fantastic performance (that moment on the bathroom, god damn!) but all the supporting cast do a very good job."
'Mads Mikkelsen is a Special Forces guy who returns home to Denmark after his wife is killed in a train accident. Two computer geeks meet up with a third and visit the very angry but not grieving widower. His teenage daughter is not dealing with the situation well either. Riders of Justice becomes a cross between Death Wish(with much better acting) and Boondock Saints. I cannot praise this film highly enough. Mads is perfect and the supporting cast superb with a surprisingly sarcastic script to accompany the necessary bloody violence. Trust me on Riders. It is one of my top three films of 2020.'

"'Like many Disney movies these days, I was more-or-less obligated to watch. My daughter was excited about it and wanted me to watch it too. As they say, If you like it, I love it. Well, not quite.

Without going into the detail of the hows and whys, the main character has to collect pieces of a broken crystal ball in order to bring back all the people turned to stone by the druuns (a plague based upon the discord of people that took physical shape). The main character, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), is aided by the dragon Sisu (Awkwafina),The movie was funny and upbeat, just not enough to keep me fully engaged.'"
'It was really an emotional biopic . A great story with lots of emotions and heartbreaks. Salute to a great hero of this nation. Jai Hind!'
'Good movie to watch for especially the war and super VFX scenes the movie has been brilliant shot the movie has got some good war drama.'

"Been meaning to watch Freaky for awhile being horror is my favorite genre, love the cast and the director glad it came on HBO! This movie is so much fun and refreshing. The story is very enjoyable where it's a horror version of Freaky Friday with touches of comedy mashed in. The Butchers mask is so awesome/cool looking which is another great aspect about the director kinda like Happy Death Day was very original at least with the mask. Kathryn Newton is perfect I love her in nearly anything! Thanks for appreciating my review to those that have!"

"THE HUNT (2020) *** Betty Gilpin, Hilary Swank, Ike Barinholtz, Wayne Duvall, Ethan Suplee, Emma Roberts, Amy Madigan. Part pitch black comedy cum horror film part political satire with a dozen strangers finding themselves being hunted down without any idea why and who among the reasons of a diabolical revenge plot. Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof's screenplay has larger aspirations with its pinprickings of every social strata in 'merica however the characters are more or less caricatures and with names like 'yoga pants' obviously not interested in developing their backstories. Gilpin is the wild-card as the shrewd final girl and her battle to the death with the event's villainous Swank is one of the best recent cinematic fights ever. (Dir: Craig Zobel)"
'A heart wrenching move about a father and daughter who are intent on getting revenge and justice for their mom/ wife.'
'News of the World is one touching emotional throwback style of film that can be classified as a historical drama and an adventure journey of hope and discovery. Set five years after the civil war an ex soldier Capt. Kidd(in a good performance from Tom Hanks) now not in battle travels and roams lands and countrysides telling stories and delivering news of happenings all across a still torn country. His life and journey is thrown into a wild card and spin while in his Texas travels he meets an innocent and precious young little lady named Johanna(the charming and wonderful Helena Zengel). The two bond and get to know one another.Along the way this film becomes somewhat of an epic travel journey and adventure like film with the drama of danger as the will to fight for life is ever present for both Capt. Kidd and little Jo(as she has a past connection to the Kiowa people). The story is entertaining as the acting and chemistry of scenes was in top notch form as it shows how travel and journey leads to discovery and new hope as it brings an emotional connection and new life for both of the two central characters. Overall watch if you enjoy historical like dramas.'

"Review By Kamal KTamil Nadu is one of the states where cinema and politics blend comfortably and Jayalalitha is one such flamboyant personalities who has left a trail of bright dots in both these fields.The movie starts off with Jayalalitha's Paanchali Shabadam and then traces back to her entry into movies,her intimacy with MGR and how she carved her way into a Male dominated political structure.If we go through the journey of Jayalalitha, it is RESILIENCE written in bold all over it and who else better than (Kangana Ranaut) can be rightful for this role.And for the bountiful of talent that Arvind Swamy is,its never too difficult for him to play any role.If Dulqer as Gemini Ganesan in Mahanati left a lasting impreession ,then Arvind Swamy as MGR too left a perennial impact.Samudrakani played the possessive confidante of MGR with poise.Karunandhi's rationalism, atheism and his literary prowess hasn't been explored much as his role was very confined.The writers didn't delve too much into a lot of other incidents and other important characters like the enigmatic Sasikala's as this movie ends with Jayalalitha taking oath as Chief Minister for the first time and her subservient MLA's bowing down to her which has now become a common scene in Tamil Nadu's political space.At the end,this movie leaves you only wanting for more as there's lot that could've been told."
"Kangana potrayal as Jayalalitha is awesome and win our hearts. Not only that, thanks to Karky and Vijayendra Prasad screenplay and Vijay direction, the film is watchable and her career best act. Defintely it is a must watch. Don't miss it."
The fictional biopic goes on the theme of 'women empowerment' and has delivered it quite convincingly. The casting is too good and everyone has given their best performance. The interactions between J and Samuthrakani take the scenes to next level. Dialogues from Karky esp. For Karuna's character is just brilliant. Good entertaining film adaptation!!
"Kangana potrayal as Jayalalitha is awesome and win our hearts. Not only that, thanks to Karky and Vijayendra Prasad screenplay and Vijay direction, the film is watchable and her career best act. Defintely it is a must watch. Don't miss it."
'Good Movie. Everybody acted well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie was good. The movie was interesting and thrilling. The movie was interesting and thrilling at 1st half. Good Movie.'
"How incredible to be able to see this show on TV instead of going to New York and spending $800.After watching it, I wished I had seen it live. A production came to my home town and the last row in the balcony was the aforementioned $800.Anyway, this is a fantastic and memorable show, all the more important for maybe getting a few kids interested in a) historical characters; and b) Broadway/musical theater.The music is not my demographic, but there are many different styles, and I loved some of the songs. The lyrics were clever. I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius.What I love is the originality, the expansiveness, the singing, the choreography, but most of all the incredible energy of the cast and story.For people who have no interest in seeing our forefathers dancing and singing, I say, watch it anyway. I wasn't interested either. It is fabulous."

"'Religion figures prominently in this slice of American Gothic from Antonio Campos but it\'s the old time religion of the Old Testament rather than the New and it\'s the Devil who\'s in the driving seat in The Devil All the Time. Covering a period of about twenty years and with a multitude of characters, most of whom come to a sticky end, it\'s a darkly funny piece of Americana set in the backwoods of West Virginia where murder is more common than a prayer before bedtime.We\'ve been down these backroads before, of course, all the way back to the seventies. Scorsese cut his teeth on material like this as did Malick and Campos shows us you certainly can\'t keep a good genre down. It meanders a little and jumps back and forth in time maybe more than it should and it\'s certainly overlong but it\'s well-acted, (particularly by Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland), and very nicely narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, author of the original novel.'"
"'This is a drama with a lot of killing. The film first focuses on Willard (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) in 1957, a WWII vet who has seen horrors. It then shifts to his son. We needed Willard to understand his son Arvin (Tom Holland). The film shifts between small towns in Ohio and West Virginia and has a subplot. It also contains third person narration that was done by someone doing a light version of Sam Elliot. Next time just get Sam Elliot and don\'t call any of the characters dude.It nicely develops many characters to give you a feel for the town folks. Most was done by narration, which I normally find annoying and poor substitute for a good scene. That was not the case here. It flowed.Guide: F-word. Sex. Nudity, mostly in B&W photos.'"
"The story spans from WWII to Vietnam War dealing with deaths in religious rural America. Willard Russell (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd) returns home from WWII in the Pacific after suffering from trauma. He marries waitress Charlotte (Haley Bennett) and together they have son Arvin. Arvin (Tom Holland) would become an orphan. He moves in with his grandparents who have adopted Lenora Laferty. They are raised as siblings. Lenora falls for new preacher Reverend Preston Teagardin (Robert Pattinson). Oh, there is also serial killer couple, Carl and Sandy.This is a jumble. There is a lot here. There are some good performances. SkarsgÃ¥rd is especially good. The cast is terrific. There is a sense of places and times. It would be nice if the story could be simplified to just Arvin's life. There is too much story with too many characters although it's never confused. I love the themes of religion and death. I also love that this movie is going for something expansive. It's probably going for too much."
"'Chaos Walking is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young man helping a mysterious young girl who crashed on his planet. There all the thoughts of men are called \'Noise\' because they are presented above their heads and can be heard from everyone.I found this movie very interesting because it had a very different and new plot, something that I had not watched before. The interpretations of both Tom Holland who played as Todd and Daisy Ridley who played as Viola were very good and the combination of both worked very well. The direction which was made by Doug Liman, it was very good and he did an excellent job on how he presented both his main characters and the plot, something that made more clear a lot of things that could confuse the audience. To sum up, I have to say that Chaos Walking is an interesting movie and I advise you not to hear the critics and just watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it.'"
"First time seeing two different IMAX movies in the same day I got to see Wrath of Man as well that's irrelevant but amazing too. Darren Lynn Bousman continued a beloved horror franchise with new faces I'm proud of Chris Rock being in horror I don't think he's done anything like it! Spiral is just as gruesome as any of the Saw films with a little bit of comedy, dirty cops, and plenty of games to be played. Well worth the money and better than a lot of the sequels."
"Another film with a dyed non blonde, that doesn't like her natural look so has to change it."
'This movie was unbelievably amazing for story. I just never expected that this kind of movies can also have that much good love stories.'
"'I must admit that whenever Liam Neeson stars in a movie, then it is a movie that I feel that I must watch, because he definitely has a track record of some rather impressive movies these last many years.However, when I read the synopsis for The Ice Road, I must admit that I wasn\'t exactly overly impressed. But still I sat down to watch the movie, as it had Liam Neeson in it, after all.And I must say that writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh actually managed to put together a good old fashioned thriller. And while the concept may have seemed a bit off, then it actually worked out well enough with having the movie take place in the frigid colds of northern Canada.The storyline told in The Ice Road is one that quickly lets its frostbite set in and director Jonathan Hensleigh doesn\'t let you go before the movie comes to an end. I have to admit that I was genuinely more than entertained by the story told in this movie.Needless to say that Liam Neeson does it quite well in this movie as well, of course he did. And he was joined by the likes of Marcus Thomas, Laurence Fishburne, Amber Midthunder and Benjamin Walker for a rather interesting and fast-paced thriller.The Ice Road was definitely a surprisingly good movie, and it was one that provided me with proper entertainment.I am rating The Ice Road a six out of ten stars.'"
"Definitely a movie to set your rational brain aside and watch simply for the sheer fun of it. That seems to be Liam Neeson's fortÃ© lately, and he does it in overdrive in this flick. Call the movie bad if you want, but one has to marvel at the way the film makers produced all the disasters in the picture, the first of which removes Laurence Fishburne from the story in a pulse pounding scenario. I'm watching this with my wife and she's got a blanket over her face every few minutes trying to ward off the inevitable. The backdrop to the story involves corruption at a regional level in which a company skimps on methane detectors and pays its miners to shut off their sensors. The cave in that develops results in Neeson's character and his disabled brother (Marcus Thomas) in a high stakes race over the titled 'Ice Road' to deliver a wellhead that's needed to save the men from suffocating. Starting out they're not alone, but conspiracy and espionage undermine the effort and at the finale, it's a race to the finish that defies credibility, but you don't watch this for a credible story, just the adrenaline rush. The mission is completed successfully for the most part, but not without it's share of misery for the brother truckers."
"Mohamedou Ould Slahi (Tahar Rahim) gets picked up by the Mauritanian police after 9/11. It's the start of his odyssey to GuantÃ¡namo Bay. Three years later, New Mexico defense attorney Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster) gets recruited to be his lawyer. She is joined by junior associate Teri Duncan (Shailene Woodley). Meanwhile, Marine lawyer Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) is recruited to be the prosecutor to give the prisoner a death sentence. He is eager for the job after losing a close friend in one of the planes. Former classmate Neil Buckland (Zachary Levi) is involved with the interrogation.Director Kevin Macdonald delivers a clear-headed dissection of the case against Mohamedou who is known here as The Mauritanian. The power of this movie comes from a straight forward telling of his story. I am uncertain about portraying the torture but somehow it has to be laid down on film. I would consider a less direct approach to give the audience some space. There are a few lines of dialogue that I wish Nancy would say. The performances are beyond reproach. All in all, this is a powerful truth seeking missile of a film."
'5 out of 5 stars.Great musical film. With a touching story. And message. Love the cast ensemble which they all did great with there musical cues. The soundtrack and musical sequences are amazing. Love every one moment of it. The direction is powerful and colorful. Making it one fun musical film.'
"'A truly stunning Steven Soderbergh masterpiece. Colors, music, dialogues, costumes, detail in the use of cameras, the harmony of every actor and actress... Sodenbergh is the greatest conductor of our time.'"
"Love and Monsters is a strangely lighthearted post-apocalyptic story. And while the premise makes it sound like a low-budget TV movie, I was quite impressed with the visual effects and the overall production quality. Dylan O'Brien is a highly relatable protagonist, and this quirky creature flick had more heart than I expected. I think more people should know about this film."
"Cold-blooded creatures and insects have mutated and grown to monstrous sizes wiping out most of humanity. Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) has been living in an underground bunker community for the last seven years. He's lonely after getting separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick). He freezes in stressful situations and is not wanted in any confrontations with the monsters. He decides to head off on his own to Aimee's seaside community. Along the way, he befriended a dog named Boy, and two survivalists Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt).Dylan O'Brien is a charismatic enjoyable lead. The section with Rooker and Greenblatt is a fun winning adventure. That is the best of the movie. The rest is somewhat average at best. It starts with a questionable premise. There is a convoluted info dump leading to a questionable premise in the bunker. There are a few undercooked ingredients in the stew. Once he gets outside and joins others, it can literally breath fresh air. It leads to another problem in the movie. The middle works so well that the last act falls a bit flat. It's a letdown to finish the movie and then there is a ham-fisted suggestion for a sequel. It's a sour note to end on. Overall, Dylan is great, the middle is great, and the rest needs work."
"'I am not sure if anyone is enjoying my riffs or how much sense some of the funny things I come up with as summary lines are making - or even if some consider them funny at all. Having said all that, the movie is funny. But even that can be judged differently by differnt individuals. The CGI work is really well done and the story is well thought of.Of course every fun moment or any moment in general happening here can be taken and dissected. Even if it has so many wink wink moments - as in knowing what we expect and try to surprise us while also delivering on what we want to see. The story is predictable - but that does not stop this from being really entertaining from start to finish. Great actors round the whole thing up - actaully my first thought concerning a summary line was Maze Runner meets Iron Fist - ok so it may have been a stretch, especially because there is not really so much hand to hand combat here ... but would be relying more on the actors involved. Enjoyable to say the least! I wouldn\'t mind a sequel as well.'"
"'I enjoyed this way more than I expected. It has love, adventures and humanity in it.'"
"'Co-helmed by the guy who wrote Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out and directed the latter 2, Soul is yet another amazing film. It goes deep, covering the nature of existence, the important of dreams and life, the need to find meaning. It goes funny, with crazy gags that leave you breathless. It goes visually stunning, with remarkable imagery. And the plot is constantly moving and shifting and surprising.Seriously, just watch it.'"
"If you've seen the original, you probably do not need to see this. I had no idea this was a remake when I watched this. But I had a strong feeling of Deja Vu. I was quite glad I had seen the original. Overall the first movie to go a certain place is better than a remake. Rule of the thumb or however the saying goes.This still can be a lot of fun. Yes it is CGI heavy, yes it isn't the best CGI ever and all that. But it can be fun to watch. Unless you are a witch and feel this is misrepresenting your way of life ... ok kidding aside (I hope that is a joke you say? Yes me too), some things may be considered offensive, but you could say similar things about the original too.A fun family film with some shockers in between - maybe not for the very small ones then."
'3 out of 5 stars.The Witches is a fantasy thriller about a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Only to learn from her that witches exist. And they hate children. When the boy comes across a witch. Grandmother decides to take boy out on a getaway at a resort. Which conveniently a group of witches are hosting a convention. Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.Cute and fun film for the family. But cheesy cgi and visual effects makes the movie feel cheapily put together. The acting was also decent with the cast ensemble. The story also comes out short with barely anything to mention.'
"When Hero's (Jahzir Bruno) parents die in a car accent in Chicago,he is raised by Octavia Spencer, the world's greatest grandmother. Unfortunately a coven of witches led by Anne Hathaway are out to change kids into mice and curse them with the voice of Chris Rock. The main action takes place in a swanky hotel.It was a fun film. I can see kids liking it."
"I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn."
"This is the story of Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya ) who lead the Chicago branch. He had one too many bills. It is also the story of Bill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) the FBI informant who assisted in getting Fred assassinated by the FBI and Chicago Police. The story starts with Fred already as a leader and with Bill getting arrested and becoming an informant.I imagine the role of the traitor was a tough one for LaKeith Stanfield who came through as a reluctant informant. While the film touches on the black struggle, he is not weighed down with being preachy , just letting the facts speak for themselves.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"'Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a companion piece to Spike Lee\'s BlackKklansman from a couple of years ago. But whereas Lee\'s film was angry, funny, and fabulously entertaining, Judas is more somber and feels saddled with the burden of being IMPORTANT.Daniel Kaluuya received most of the attention and the Oscar for playing Fred Hampton, leader of the Black Panthers who was assassinated as part of an FBI raid. But it\'s Lakeith Stanfield, as the film\'s titular Judas, who impressed me more. Kaluuya\'s performance consists of a series of loud speeches, but Stanfield is the character with the story arc, a man who must live with his decision to act as an FBI informant. Stanfield was at least nominated along with Kaluuya, but true to Academy form, loud and showy always triumphs over quiet and thoughtful.It\'s a solid bit of movie making, but it\'s lacking something that could have made it a blaze of outrage rather than the tsk tsk tsking history lesson that it is.The end credits song Fight for You brought the film a second Oscar, while it scored additional nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.Grade: B+'"

'This is a killer story with an exciting twist. The main character has got a distinctive charisma. I enjoyed watching it.'
"'Always was a fan of the cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry so for sure I watched the latest big screen movie, and must say it was really good and entertained as the way the animation mixed with live action and people characters was super great. Set in New York City the big apple the tale involves a wedding(only things get elephant like crazy!) And both the cat and mouse take up shop in the luxury loft elegant hotel and their chases entertain! Wrapped around it all is a young lady and hotel lobby worker Kayla(Chloe Grace Moretz) as all become friends and learn about the ins and outs of life! The music score and scenes are well done as it even has avid fans thinking back to memories of the old classic Hanna Barbera days. In the end things stay the same with the classic chase rivals only it\'s live happily ever after for others. Good tribute and entertaining movie of the classic cat and mouse duo.'"
"Animation is so well done reminded me of Who Killed Roger Rabbit where the real world is mixed and they interact with the cartoons. Anyway I see why so many highly rated Tom and Jerry it's so lovable, heartwarming when Chloe Grace Moretz character says it's like they've been fighting years. I'm so happy there was more animation than you'd expect that's great for fans! Tim Story is very good at making feel-good films."
"'It times feels like two movies at once, Tom and Jerry stepping out there comfort zone and into the real world, playing off the live action characters, like Chole Grace Moretz and Michael Pena.\nA fun time for anybody is a Tom and Jerry fan, animation was good, not for everybody I mean building a movie around this is not easy, the original Tom and Jerry cartoon is just a series of shorts. so it can not be those two going at it.'"
"'The bright, colorful Tom & Jerry brings the cartoon duo into the real world, and even if it never amounts to much more than a series of escalating hijinks, it provides a fair amount of laughs outside the antics of its namesake duo. Loved it. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 3/16/2021'"
"At one point in Bhoot Police, a character, addressing a crowd, advises them not to believe in the two tantric babas who have been hired to drive away the local chudail. They have only been hired because their father was a famous tantric. She says: Nepotism ne yeh poora desh barbad kar diya hai. And on cue, Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor, playing the ghostbusters Vibhooti and Chiraunji, give each other a look. Both actors are of course, products of nepotism themselves and their knowing expression made me smile. But that's pretty much as clever as Bhoot Police gets.Read the full review on Film Companion."
"If you're looking for a nice Saturday or Sunday evening entertainment, this is the movie for you. Bollywood actually needs such horror comedies. Saif ,Arjun, Yami, Jacqueline, Javed Jaffee all in one and do their parts well. The atroy itself is fun, with comedy all through. Yes, the climax could've been shortened a bit, but it's ok, I am already looking forward to this been made as a franchise of sorts. It could actually breathe some new life in the tired Bollywood Horror genre, which is none.Full credit to the director too."
"'Wow this is very good! The centrepiece is the one take action scene that lasts for almost thirty minutes, encompassing car chase, gun shots and jumping off buildings. It is intense like you cannot imagine.'"
"I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.Chris Hemsworth, always the most charismatic of the AVENGERS, is a great choice for the taciturn lead and he really throws himself into the brawling, bruising action scenes. The story is nothing special, we've seen it done a million times before, but the direction is fresh and vibrant and the action choreography is excellent. The two highlights are the lengthy chase sequence at the mid point, which utilises all kinds of heavy camera work, camera tricks, and stunt doubles to truly convince, and of course the immersive bridge spectacle at the climax. What a delight to see America finally catching up with the likes of China's WOLF WARRIOR 2 in terms of films featuring lavish, wide-scale thrills and spills."
"'So, here is a pretty fantastic horror movie. I had reservations about watching it because it\'s filmed entirely through Zoom, which felt like an irritating gimmick, but I got used to it pretty quickly and didn\'t even notice it after a while.This could be the newest Paranormal Activity, or Blair Witch Project. You know, low budget movie, no-name (but fantastic) actors, get together and make a genuinely scary movie.The fact that it is only an hour long is a strength, as there is barely any extraneous material in the movie.I say check it out.'"
"Watching a review on YouTube by Double Toasted,I was surprised to hear them mention a code for free 30 days on the streaming service Shudder. Signing up,I decided the film film I'd unlock to view,was one I've heard a lot about under Lockdown.View on the film:Zooming into production during Lockdown, co-writer/(with Gemma Hurley & Jed Shepherd) director Rob Savage displays a inventiveness in creating chills,whilst filming under social distancing, via sudden close-ups on the screen capturing how helpless the others are in being unable to help out.Wisely kept to a lean runtime of under an hour, Savage dials this Found Footage with surprisingly creepy special effects, where the limited bedrooms location gives the moving chairs and shattering glass,a invasion of personal space eerie atmosphere.Making Haley regret her prank on the call, the writers take the major plot point from the interesting Hammer Horror title The Quiet Ones (2014-also reviewed),and wastes it,with little drama coming from the accidental conjuring,instead going for Found Footage jolts and jump-scare crashing sounds, over poor performances across the call,with the cast failing to create the impression of being mates before the call is cut."

"Due to the repetitive nature of time loop movies, they have to be done right in order to keep the audience engaged the whole time. Palm Springs does it right. This film does a great job of keeping things fresh. Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother. I wish this film were a little less vulgar, so it would be accessible to a broader audience, because I think more people should take a trip with Palm Springs."
"'Funny movie with an interesting story. andy samberg is awesome. cristin milioti gives a beastly performance. good love story. (1 viewing, 2/24/2021)'"
"'For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, Groundhog Day, Palm Springs is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It\'s got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It\'s a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it\'s not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It\'s all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-'"
"Netflix as a company is mostly miss on their productions. This film is one of the few exceptions, it's a solid production.Firstly, Netflix have avoided the woke - it's a well done.Secondly, the story is quite interesting and well paced, although it occasionally jumps and you have to pay close attention.Thirdly, the film is very violent at times and it's something I have never enjoyed about the Witcher series - the violence serves no purpose. If you compare this to Romper Stomper or Fight Club, you will appreciate what I mean. Both of those films revolve around violence with a purpose ... or even V for Vendetta.I would not recommend this for sensitive younger viewers. I enjoyed it enough to watch it a few times."
"'This film start with a little boy run away from the monster, and a witcher Vesemir saving him scene! As turnout, this film is about Vesemir need to killing a villain Tetra, who hated witcher! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the blackout scene, and overuse of the drinking scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene quite bloody gore, but overall have slow motion, messy, not intense, and occur in too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after killing Tetra, Vesemir recruit the orphans to join him! That\'s it! Another disappointed film!'"
I only went to see this film after seeing is score on imbd but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.There was plenty of action and a good plot. I didn't understand a lot of it but it was good fun.I would go again to see another film like this.
"I had so much fun with this movie, it was only playing in a theatre a half an hour drive away from where I live so I drove to the theatre and was blown away by just how good it was.The animation was amazing. It's was fluid, kinetic and very crisp and detailed. I was a bit hesitant on watching it at first, since I knew this movie would hold some major spoilers for the seiries, and I've only watched the first episode of the anime show since I've only known about it for a week since discovering it on Netflix. This movie does have major spoilers though, but I encourage you to see this in a theatre as soon as you can if tv spoilers bother you or not.I was worried that the whole movie being set on a train would get stale fast, but it is always exciting and doesn't drag a bit. If watching Train To Busan taught me anything, it's that movies set in limited spaces such as trains can still be constantly exciting if it stays engaging. This movie just like Train To Busan isn't entirely set on the train, there are flashbacks and an action sequence seperate from the train.Anyway this was an exceptional movie with very good direction and animation. It was thrilling and also very emotional. Don't miss this one"
"This movie isn't even a movie or at least it doesn't use the same formula as any other. It's pretty much action for 3/4 of the movie, and the action is absolutely incredible! It's so fluid and amazingly thought out and it comes together so well! The crazy thing is this movie all takes place in the one area, excellent use of setting throughout. There is quite a bit of cgi aswell but it looks pretty good compared to most anime. The start may be a bit slow and it may not have a real focus but just keep watching it gets reeeaaally great. The main character of the show is in the shade of the side characters as well, it really does an amazing job of create a central focus on this new character while still having other main characters feel a part of the movie. Until the end...the action shuts up and the tears start :( bruh...it so sad. It's so well done I can't put into words how baffling the ending is. If you've seen the show you gotta continue it sooo good and it leaves it for future projects. :D."
'Graphics are amazing the story is good pretty sure we will have a sequel.But even better the music they chose was amazing.All in all very violent not for kids but a great anime for adults.'
"'One of the best CGI fantasy environments I\'ve seen. The detail; color saturation; 3-D naturalistic movement of the nasty critters, and just a whole lot of them to keep you on your toes. They borrowed scenes from many past sy-fy movies, but did so in quality creative ways. We are given Dune sand monster w/footsteps on sand; above & below ground spider & web chase & entrapment; sand storm w/electrical discharge; dinosaurs (especially the rib cage scene reminds me of Pitch Black) & fire breathing dragons; flaming swords; 3 masted sand schooner; monolithic mysterious structure; Guardians raccoon equivalent cat; parallel world. Just a very complete mixed bag even the dirt on the characters was real. Except, Milla still has lipstick - not uncommon w/female action characters. Nice adaption from the game.'"
"I was expecting this to be a run of the mill awful action film with one note performances, but surprisingly I was entertained, although I'd say not a great film, but in some ways it kind of knows that.\nThe effects are pretty enjoyable, like almost similar to Jurassic Park. Mila Jovovich and Tony Jaa do play off each other quite well, and both are really at action. Ron Perlman is also good in his supporting role. I never played the game in which this is based, but i'm sure it's every bit has entertaining."
"'Minari is one heartfelt touching family drama of love and wisdom as a viewer sees how being together grows a family strong no matter what kind of cards are dealt their way. Set in the early 80\'s a Korean American family has moved from the hustle and hassle world of California to the rural south to an Arkansas farm for a chance at the American dream, as new roots of goals and life have been planted. Jacob(the good Steven Yeun) and Monica(Yeri Han) want to break from their 9 to 5 life of working at a chicken factory so Jacob invest in the earth and land and equipment to start planting seeds to grow harvest so he can become a fine farmer. Their two small kids David(Alan S. Kim who\'s so cute) and Anne(Noel Cho) have to adjust to a new school and life that involves church too. And things do twist and spin even more when their stubborn and go against the grain rule breaking grandmother Soonja(Yuh-Jung-Youn) arrives. Grandma is loving and caring though and she brings a little seed of magic and hope to the Arkansas farm! Challenges and ups and downs are common still thru it all this picture shows that at home if a family has love, togetherness, with hard work and determination they will last no matter what happens. Overall wonderful film that one will love watching as they see a strong masterful family.'"
"'First off, this movie is subtitled; but don\'t let that make you miss this movie. A Korean family living in California in the 1980s moves to Arkansas for the rich soil. Patriarch of the family Jacob (Steven Yeun) wants more than life to be a farmer. His wife Monica (Yeri Han) and children have experienced culture shock and disappointment as they try to get accustomed with the hillbilly form of life..Husband and wife get jobs sexing young chickens, because the males are considered worthless. Jacob spends every spare moment trying to grow the biggest garden possible. Be on the watch for Alan S. Kim, who plays young David.Let me stop to not spoil this wonderful film. Beautiful scenery and characters build before your eyes.'"
"It's 1983. Korean immigrant Yi family moves from California to rural Arkansas where the father dreams of growing Korean vegetables and grab a piece of the American dream. His wife has massive doubts. The couple works hard sexing chicks. Their son has heart problems. The wife's mother arrives to take care of the kids. The family is befriended by religious fanatic Paul. It's a struggle on many fronts.It's the classic immigrant struggle and it's as compelling as ever. It feels real. It feels personal. It just feels. It's a movie with all the feelings. It's funny, sad, intense, and light-hearted. All the performances are great and they all feel real."
"'What is it about subtitles informing us, Chicken clucking; Chicken squawking. Really helpful!\nFive stars for expressing the theme of female empowerment, and the critical thought that family honor should not determine a young girl\'s future. That equality not servitude should be the norm. That girl\'s should not be molded to be a good wife by having to show obedience, elegance, politeness, poise, gracefulness, and to serve her husband in silence.\nOne star for the poor flying wire scenes & camera edited, not realistic, fight scenes, & Mulan suddenly wearing lots of makeup with flowing hair when she exposes herself as a female. One star for Disney kowtowing to gain Chinese viewers by appeasing Chinese censorship in promoting obedience to the Emperor (Xi Jinping), and his dynasty (the CCP crackdown on individual freedom).'"
"'In the much coveted role as Mulan, a cool, calm and collected Liu Yifei serviceably passes off as a virtuosic warrior with her well-trained gymnastic prowess (beautifully captured by the tired slo-mo treatment), but as so often she must conceal her comely femininity under a facile mannish comportment, she seems to err on the side of also bottling up Mulan\'s emotions, which leaves any inward outputting border on minimum, and the story of MULAN is actually very emotional (a baptism of fire experience about warfare, self-identity and defiance), but Liu mainly puts on a brave face and plows on without telegraphing much inner fluctuation, that is a major letdown.reading the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks'"
"'It\'s curious that this film has been rated 15 - most of the intended audience must surely be younger than that! The premiss is that Blu Hunt (Danni) wakes up in an institution where she is told that she has mutant powers and is being cared for until she can master them safely. Along with four other patients/inmates she slowly comes to realise that this is more of a prison than an hospital and the initially suspicious and antagonistic group start to bond. Maybe what makes this stand out is the fact that a Marvel adventure openly, and rather understatedly, depicts a same sex attraction between the heroine and Maisie Williams Rahne (pronounced rain) but otherwise it\'s a pretty lacklustre, character free 90 minutes with great special effects but little, if any, menace after an extraordinarily long build up. Clearly teed up for a sequel, let\'s hope they spend more time developing their personalities next time.'"
"GREENLAND is the latest Hollywood disaster movie about a world-ending comet striking the Earth and mankind doing their best to avoid it. It goes for a more realistic approach than many; no silly attempts to ward off the disaster here, just people scurrying for safety in one of the few places on the planet that'll protect them. It's a lower budget movie than expected, with just a couple of CGI bits, but in many ways that makes it a tighter and more realistic thriller. The main thrust of the story is about efforts to keep the nuclear family together despite the odds. Gerard Butler is an actor I like and a good lead in this, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor. It's nothing new but it has a good pace to make it quite watchable."
"For me to like a movie I ask myself some questions. Was I entertained? Was the cinematography of good quality? Were the actors doing a decent job? Was the story somewhat enjoyable to watch? On all of these questions above I have to answer yes. My wife wasn't that thrilled about Enola Holmes, rating it a six, just because the main character was talking directly to us, the audience, but I on the other hand thought that was a clever thing to do to tell her story. Millie Bobby Brown, well known since the brilliant series Stranger Things, is definitely an actress that we will see a lot in the future. Don't forget she's still only 15 while playing Enola Holmes, and the least we can say is that she's very convincing as an actress, very enjoyable to watch. No doubt she will become easy on the eye once she will grow up, so I can see a bright future in good movies for her. The rest of the cast did also a good job playing their respective characters. Henry Cavill is an actor that plays in good production and there's a reason for that. Enola Holmes is easy entertainment, just the kind I needed at this moment."
"'Honestly, if all hijacking-depiction movies/series end this way, They\'d be in big trouble (all characters involved).Nevertheless, a great movie with very good acting by all the cast, full of basic instincts & emotions (especially Elias and Nadja), realistic creatures\' movements, suspenseful score and an amazing flow. Had it not been for some dismal technical/physics big holes destroying the logic of events, it would have surpassed many productions out there and would have been one of the truly unique productions in the genre as depicted in that confined space.So, summing it up, a very nice try for that budget, huge effort put in by all the cast and crew (Netflix Europe/Germany section) and above all, 2 hours of thrilling entertainment, nearly glued to your seat.Well done and expect more high-level productions from them, hopefully with bigger allocated budgets. Roll on...Screenplay/story: 7Direction/development: 9Realism: 9Entertainment: 9Acting: 9.2Cinematography/filming: 9Visuals/special effects: 9.4Sound/score: 8.5Depth: 8Logic: 4Flow: 8.8Horror/thrill: 8.5Ending: 7.'"
"The last few vampire movies which i enjoyed were 30 Days of Night, Let me In n the low budget Prowl.This one really nailed it.It has ample amount of tension, suspense n brutal mayhem.The scene n the place where they show how the lead character got infected is atmospheric n i hope they show more on the father son story.But alas, the way they ended, left no room for a sequel.Hope at least a prequel.It was good to see Dominic Purcell aft a long time.This one has shades of Red Eye, Liam Neeson's Non-Stop n Snakes on a Plane."
"Pretty good movie, wasn't something special but this watchable before sleep, family friendly."
'This story is engaging and intense enough. The characters make you want to care about them.'
"'This 2020 thriller stars Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen.\nThis begins with a woman, Diane (Paulson) giving birth to a baby that becomes incubated. Seventeen Years later, Diane is tending to her teenage daughter, Chloe (Allen) who is crippled. Soon, Chloe suspects that she\'s hiding something from her. This is a good, tense thriller that has a Misery vibe and both actresses are good in it. I recommend this if you\'re into psychological thrillers.'"
'Run was a well acted thriller that had some very good psychological chills in it that were able to impress me in a sort of a way.Before watching this film i thought i will witness another cliched horror film with psychological drama that i saw a million times before but i was actually surprised by this film in a good way.Actresses give a very good job expecely Sarah Paulson who was very creeepy in some scenes and in end she did a god job.Kiera Allen is a actress that i dont know much about but she also did a good job.Run was a nice surprise for me and i was happy with it'
"'Run' is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.What happens when you suddenly don't trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? 'Run' explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film's protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. 'Run' became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.Once the characters are set up, it doesn't take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she's a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don't want to do any spoilers, so I'm not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn't come soon enough. Not because I didn't like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you're into thrillers).Kiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought 'Run' was excellent.Would I watch it again? Yes."
'Amanda is honestly so talented! The plot is great!'
Quite Alrite with old movie concept with adding new elements. It's a bit long and horror part not that advanced. But still good with the storyline.
"'8/10 - while I agree with other reviewers that the ending was a little underwhelming, this was all-in-all a captivating horror thriller that kept unraveling and peaking my curiosity.'"
'Michael Rianda joins animation royalty (Brad Bird et al) with one of the sharpest scripts in years.'
"It seemed boring, a family facing machines, the title sums it up and it doesn't help, but what a captivating family, it seems our family, maladjusted, crazy, but that everyone loves each other, special participation of that perfect, margarine commercial in the urge, but none surpasses ours, the adventures are wonderful, the perfect strips, super fun and exciting..."
'Kristen Stewart plays a mechanical engineer (first unbelievable part) on the deep water Kepler drilling station owned by TIAN. While brushing her teeth there is a hull breech and the film is in full action and survival mode. Not too hard to figure out (before she does) that there is something out there. They drilled too deep.For some reason it reminded me of Jaws 3D. There was no introduction of characters. We are introduced to the mining operation through news clips during the opening credits. It was weak. I would have rather have seen a group conversation over the issues while building character. Kristen Stewart spends part of film running around in poor lighting in bra and panties. She is no Jane Russell.Guide: 1 quick muttered F-word. No sex or nudity.'
"I enjoy these types of movies. it wasn't anything special. but it was suspenseful and i enjoyed the experience. lots of cool moments and scary sequences. a good time overall (1 viewing, 9/19/2020)"
"Sonic the Hedgehog - 3\nHuh. This movie actually wasn't that bad. Sonic the Hedgehog borrows heavily from other buddy road trip movies we've seen, and some of the characters' decisions don't make sense, but this is a harmless film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Also, my kids really enjoyed it. And seeing has how most video game adaptations are terrible, that makes this film adaptation one of the better ones."
"Well it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. The Sonic face was better it looked more similar with original game. The best part of movie are songs. Everything was a little bit too basic, jokes were lame, plot was meh."
"Well made movie all around. very funny and fun. great pacing and kept me invested throughout.i already said it was very funny, but i need to specifically talk about jim carrey and the pure gold that is every scene he's in. his first scene in the movie had me crying, no exaggeration. it wasn't that hysterical for the rest of his scenes, but when he wasn't hilarious, he was so awesomely over the top. a perfect role for him, and a perfect casting choice since i can't imagine anyone else making such an outlandish character believable. jim carrey, you are the GOAT (1 viewing, 5/10/2020)"
"Sonic the Hedgehog (Ben Schwartz) is a blue alien refugee on Earth. He's living in secret near the small town of Green Hills. Tom (James Marsden) is the town's friendly sheriff. When Sonic accidentally causes a power outage, the Pentagon calls up evil genius Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).The Sonic redesign is good. This is mostly fun. Jim Carrey is very weird which somewhat fits. I like Sonic and I like his chemistry with Marsden. I like the family. It's all somewhat good but nothing great. It doesn't have much of a plot. The last act is not that great. That makes this a good video game movie."
"The film is part of a certain genre of lovable alien coming to Earth and being chased by unnecessarily evil and ineffective power hungry guys while being protected by regular people for emotional reasons. It checks all the boxes, it is funny and pleasant, too. The villain, while being the usual cardboard evil character, gets much more nuanced and interesting from Jim Carrey's performance. And frankly, I thought James Marsden was just a pretty face, but I kind of like him in everything he does so, good luck James!As a successful and fun to watch movie based on a game - they are too few and far between - I think this is way above the average. Maybe a bit too childish, though, but I guess this film isn't for adults."
"DreamWorks will forever be my favorite studio for now on, Disney showed it's TRUE self during the pandemic didnt release anything we could see in the theater and only caved and released them but on THEIR disney streaming service. I will NEVER go to a disney movie again!! But DreamWorks gave us a phenomenal film it was full of adventure, comedy, had tension incredible animation and above all gave us something to see in the theater. I went twice to the theater and purchased the 3d bluray!! I will buy any DreamWorks bluray that is released and will see every film they release in the theater!!!! THANK YOU DREAMWORKS!!!!!!!!!"
"One of the first prehistoric families sets out searching of a safer place to call home. When they think they have found paradise, another family, the Bettermans, already lives there. Beautiful elaborate tree house with acres of fresh produce, plenty of fresh water and scores of amazing inventions. It won't take long for tensions to escalate between the two families. Full family fun and beautiful choreography.This animated film features the voices of: Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, Kelly Marie Tran, Catherine Kenner, Joel Crawford and Peter Dinkladge."

"'This film feels like Ferris Bueller joins the army. Then gets discharged and becomes a junkie. It has a quirky first-person narrative throughout the film with clever film editing and a added love interest for Bueller, cough Cherry (Tom Holland).'"
"Second movie in a row for me featuring Tom Holland. After Chaos Walking, that was quite enjoyable to me as a fantasy movie and that despite the low ratings it got, this time Cherry, a powerful movie about PTSD but mostly about addiction, heroin addiction to be more precise. Not as powerful as The Basketball Diaries but certainly good enough to keep you far away from heroin after watching it. Tom Holland just nailed it here, very good performance playing his character. Ciara Bravo also did a good job. The destructive relationship they are in, the issues that both have, it's all well filmed and keeps you interested in the entire story. A long movie but never boring. Good to excellent cinematography, great cast, great story, what else can you ask for? Again an underrated movie with Tom Holland."
"Conceptually very strong, loved the characters and they have great chemistry. However, there's so much information trying to be conveyed that the main storyline gets lost. This would make for a great series but it's too much for a 2 hr movie. But great acting and the action choreography is intense."
"It was interesting, I would even say something unique. Plot has some action,some adventures and history moments. Not sure about that plot hole when someone betrayals, it just doesn't make sense and lower quality of whole film. I would recommend to watch this movie for action lovers, I found it similar to Suicide Squad."
'4 out of 5 stars.The second film was a bit of a letdown with its uneven direction. The third film does end the trilogy in a good slow direction that picks up in a bloody showdown third act. The film takes the characters back in 1666 to give an origin story of the witch. When a village of settlers in the town. Gets cursed and people starts pointing accusations towards girls who seem out of place. Without giving away spoilers. There is a twist which turns the film direction into a bloody third act. Where a few teens try to hold up in a place to face against a variety of killers while trying to kill the evil.Plot is good. The cast ensemble is good. It took awhile to get used to the same cast playing different characters in 1666 which felt weird at first. Especially the accents they were using. But the story keeps you engaged. The thrills is good. And the third act is bloody entertaining. The film holds back a soundtrack with spending more time on a music score.The film does give it a proper conclusion. While leaving a mid credit scene for more possibilities.'
"'Fear Street: 1666 is a Mystery - Horror movie and the third movie of the Fear Street franchise, in which we continue our journey in the past. We are now back on 1666 and we watch how all started and how the curse of Sarah Fier released.I enjoyed the third movie of this franchise the same way as the previous two. The plot continued to surprise me since there were some plot twists that I did not expect and made the movie even more interesting. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak who made also the direction for the previous two movies followed the same successful way. The interpretations of Kiana Madeira who played as Sarah Fier / Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Henry / Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Lizzie / Kate and Olivia Scott Welch who played as Hannah Miller / Samantha Fraser were for one more time very good. All in all, I have to say that Fear Street: 1666 and Fear Street franchise was simply amazing and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. I am sure that if you are a horror movies fan you will simply love this franchise.'"
"Which is an extraordinary achievement even in today's upside down world. The first in the trilogy was so good I sat through the second and third, parts of my life I will never get back. Whichever exec greenlighted this disaster should find a new line of work."
"'I had only seen the first one, but I saw a review of the second one. Yes, it was the Nostalgia Critic who showed me that one. Anyway, this movie features Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter reprising their roles decades after the first movie. That deserves credit by itself. The plot features Bill and Ted saying that at 7:17pm of this night, they have to write the perfect song or else time will be destroyed. They go to themselves in the future when they make the perfect song.Like the first one, this relies mostly on creativity as its strong point. It really seemed like this didn\'t have that much on comedy as the other ones. It\'s still enjoyable, because it gets very creative. I will admit that it did get a little boring at times and even for a movie that\'s an hour and a half, it could have been shorter. The characters (and actors) are still likeable, which is another strong point. I\'m so glad to finally see a new movie released in theaters since Sonic The Hedgehog: The Movie! ***'"
"As entertainment I thought Greyhound was slightly better than 1917 for example. There's more suspense in this movie than in the Oscar winning war movie from last year. That said Greyhound is sometimes a bit repetitive without being boring though. If you're like me not a big fan of wild waters and the open sea then Greyhound will be more effective, there will be more suspense as the naval battles are quite impressive. Tom Hanks did another good job with his character, he's a guarantee for success. I'm still waiting to see a bad movie with Tom Hanks. The CGI's were well done and added to the suspense. I wished they would have filmed the German side as well, in the submarine for example. I think that was a missed opportunity that would have made this movie even better. But I'm not going to complain, Greyhound was entertaining for me. If you like movies like Das Boot give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed."
"'There is a superb book written by Rear-Adm. WS Chalmers that describes, in considerable detail, the career of Adm. Sir Max Horton - the man who ended up commanding what was known (in the UK) as the Western Approaches - the crucial lifeline between the UK and her supply chains from across the world. Tom Hanks (Capt. Krause) is the captain of one such lifeline leading, for his first time, a convoy across the Atlantic with just three warships to combat the increasingly effective Nazi U-boat wolf pack strategy that enabled the torpedoing of the freighters in a coherent and effective manner. Hanks carries much of this film en seul; his efforts as the officer juggling the responsibilities of keeping his fleet safe whilst combatting the atrocious conditions the ocean has to throw at them result in a strongly delivered character in whom we can all too readily believe. Some of the visual effects are top drawer, too - particularly towards the end when the battle lines are drawn and engagement with the enemy provides us with an enthralling sense of suspense and jeopardy. Some of the battle effects are little too Battleships at times, but they do contribute well to the overall and effective sense of peril that was faced by these young, inexperienced, seamen on mission after mission. Aaron Schneider (and Hanks with his writing hat on) have done a good job immortalising in film what CS Forester had already, poignantly, written.'"
"Greyhound (4 out of 5 stars).Greyhound is a good war film that follows Captain Krause (Tom Hanks) as his ship escorts a group of cargo ships during WWII. Which they come across a nazi submarine that plays cat and mouse with them. As they battle to survive.This film is very fast paced. With very little to none on the character and story development. Occasionally having Krause having flashbacks of his wife played by Elizabeth Shue. The film is non stop action which you may have to buckle up for this wild ride. The plot is good. About Krause captaining Greyhound ship and trying to escort others.The direction does deliver a chaotic battle sequence. Putting you right in the crew's perspective with the action. As they see a sub ascending with a torpedo coming towards them or seeing a ship flashed from an explosion. The action is big, loud, and chaotic which you have to see on the big screen. The music score was great as it created that intense feeling and mood when a threat is near.I was a little disappointed with Tom Hanks script which did not have any character development or characterization with anyone. The script is consist of crew members yelling out orders or demands on the ships actions. Which was thin and lacking for about anything else for a war movie.But it was one wild ride that will have you on the edge of your seat."
"What a beautiful, moving story and film, and acting....I was stunned by this feature, and I realized that it was real good for mental health to discover such gems from time to time. That's unfortunately not the kind of film that audiences in theaters will come to see, at least not the bulk audiences. There is not real love interest here, not as in other films, I mean. This is a so sensitive and poignant story, so unexpected story telling. Thanks Netflix for having released this movie."

"Former lawman George Blackledge (Kevin Costner) and his wife Margaret (Diane Lane) suffer a great loss when their son die in an accident. Their daughter-in-law Lorna, with their grandson Jimmy, remarries to Donnie Weboy. The couple leaves town without telling the Blackledges. Margaret is desperate to find them. The Blackledges track them back to the Weboy family home run by commanding matriarch Blanche.The first half works like a horror movie. It's building up to an epic meeting. It could have stayed in the horror lane. It may be the better move. Instead, I have to question some of what the Blackledges are doing. They are escalating the situation. I don't mind turning it into a family feud. I would not try to force rooting interest into this fight. If it's kept a horror, this would be a lot simpler. As a Greek tragedy, it works better if both sides are more equal in responsibility. It would make Blanche's final question more poignant. I would also question what the police would do after the movie ends. They are dragging poor Peter into this mess. I'm sure the police would be coming after him even if they don't mess with the white women."
"'Without Remorse is an Action - Thriller movie in which we watch a United States Navy SEAL seeking revenge for the death of his wife. As soon as he starts searching more about it he finds himself into a large conspiracy that will affect everyone\'s lives.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it had some plot twists that made it interesting. The direction which was made by Stefano Sollima, it was very good and he presented very well his main character, his thoughts and his dreams. The interpretation of Michael B. Jordan who played as John Kelly was very good and he did an excellent job at his part. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jodie Turner-Smith\'s who played as Karen Greer, Guy Pearce\'s who played as Secretary Clay and Jamie Bell\'s who played as Robert Ritter. In conclusion, I have to say that Without Remorse is a simple, interesting, action movie that is good to spend your time with, if you have high expectations from it then I advise you to lower them.'"
"7/10 - while I am by no means a Pete Davidson fan, I couldn't help but appreciate the brutal honesty in this often-funny semi-autographical dramedy"
"'Seriously Mr. Apatow... 136 minutes of too much filler, not enough substance? This was way too long and way too slow. The only reason I didn\'t fall asleep, was Davidson\'s fine balance of pathos and humor throughout the film. His story was very relatable and he performed/portrayed it quite well. The supporting cast was great as well. Had this film been cut/edited down to approx 90 mins with better pacing, and some crazier and funnier moments, it would\'ve been a real hit. Still, mad props to Davidson for telling his story so well. Too bad Apatow didn\'t write and direct it better.'"
"I would say it's very interesting movie to watch. Not too complicated to catch main idea and fallow plot. Still the ending wasn't strong part of this film. I'm still missing ending, it wasn't very clear."
"7/10 - while I am by no means a Pete Davidson fan, I couldn't help but appreciate the brutal honesty in this often-funny semi-autographical dramedy"
"'2017\'s The Babysitter remains one of the most unexpectedly entertaining Netflix Originals ever, given that it was co-written and directed by none other than hack-for-hire McG.And while this recently-released sequel doesn\'t match the original\'s inspired level of gory insanity, it is nevertheless a follow-up unafraid to go balls-to-the-wall in the pursuit of knowingly trashy thrills.As much as it\'s a totally unnecessary sequel, it arguably justifies its existence through its self-aware, goofy tone, and commitment to splashing the screen with as much ridiculous gore as possible.'"
"'This is a gory teen slasher film. Some scenes are over the top bloody, but it manages to maintain a fun vibe.'"
"Genuinely funny, surprisingly heartfelt, and entertaining from beginning-end, Bad Boys For Life has to be one of the biggest surprises of the last few years. There's nothing quite like a throwback buddy-cop film, and Smith & Lawrence have once again proved to us that the franchise should be here to stay. Aside from a Fast & Furious style ridiculous twist and some hit or miss jokes, Bad Boys For Life is a thrilling action film that will surely lead to more sequels, for better or worse.7.7/10"
"This is one of the best third installments in a series I've ever seen. It was perfect. The right blend of nostalgia and old faces with fresh blood and modern technology. It was jam packed with action, touching moments, and laugh out loud humor. It was indescribably good. Lawrence and Smith have undeniable chemistry and make this movie flow seamlessly. This series was brought beautifully into the year 2020. I can't wait for more."

"'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is a Comedy - Music movie in which we watch two musicians having a dream representing their country Iceland at the world\'s biggest song competition, Eurovision Song Contest. They succeed on taking the chance to represent their country and now they have to prove to everyone that they can win.I liked this movie because it had a simple, nice and very funny plot combined very well with some romantic scenes. For one more time Will Ferrell who played as Lars Erickssong was simply hilarious and his interpretation was very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you will like it and you will laugh a lot.'"
"This is way way better than I expected. It's fun and entertaining. It even brings tears to my eyes at the end, which is very unexpected! I really enjoyed it."
"'Sci-fi is extremely rare in French cinema ,but Netflix lent a helping hand and presto ! An estimable work well acted by reliable MÃ©lanie Laurent.MÃ©lanie\'s fate,in the first part of the movie , may remind you of Ryan Reynolds\' in the excellent buried (2010); what does it matter if Reynolds is buried alive in a coffin by a group of Irakis and if Laurent is locked up inside a cryogenic chamber with the highest technology? ;both try to communicate with the outside world , both are more and more anxious because their oxygen is running out ; and voices they get tell them to take it easy ,but actually makes them more terrified by the horrible fate which lies in store for them. Ryan \'s got only a mobile phone ,Laurent has plenty of paraphernalia around her,but most of the time,it backfires against her : the charitable euthanasia trick almost verges on black humor .There\'s an unexpected twist halfway through which explains why the heroine is stuck in her chamber,followed by awesome pictures which pack a real wallop .The second part is not as gripping as the first one ,and there is a certain blandness infiltrates the story .But it\'s so rare to see French actors in sci-fi (too bad that Malik Zidi \'s part is so small) that it\'s cause for celebration.'"
"Ava Faulkner (Jessica Chastain) is a professional assassin. She was an over-achiever, a drunk, and then a soldier. She is constantly battling her addiction. She got recruited by her superior Duke (John Malkovich) into the company. To his dismay, she continues to ask her victims questions before she kills them. Duke's boss Simon (Colin Farrell) is concerned. Ava returns to visit her family after an 8 year absence. Her sister Judy (Jess Weixler) is dating her ex Michael (Common). Her mother Bobbi (Geena Davis) is in the hospital for a minor heart attack.This has lots of big name actors. This needs to decide what it wants to be. It has all the elements of gritty personal drama and flashiness of an international murderous conglomerate. In one moment, it has some realism and in another, it has all the fighting gun action of the latest John Wick film. It hits me all at once in Saudi Arabia. I'm fine with the exaggerated fighting in the hotel room. I'm excited by her pretending to be the damsel in distress. Taking on a squad of heavily armed soldiers is just being unnecessarily over the top. They don't seem to know how serious to take this movie. It ends up being a B-movie with a lot of talent who are cashing in some cheques."
"And we're back into the 90s again, sort of. We do have a female lead though. And I don't mind the very predictable structure that much (feel free to disagreee here). What I do mind is the execution of the action and the stunts. They are not bad, but they don't incite excitement either - not as much as they could.I do love Jessica Chastain, but her action hero ego does not come off as strong - not as strong as it is supposed to be. A shame almost, especially because a fight scene Malkovich has, seems more potent and lethal than most of the other stuff. And that is what an action movie should prioritize, shouldn't it? If you are more forgiving in that aspect, maybe the paper thin story will wring more out of this than for others. Or maybe just the fact that you have really good actors (overqualified some might say) in this ... whatever floats your boat"
"Talk about a slow burn of a movie ... some may read horror movie and think this will be just one jump scare after another ... and while there are some of those, this builds up! And in quite the original and weird fashion! The fear of living or being in your own appartment/house cannot be put into words. Well not accurately that is - which is why this is also a visual treat.A horror movie that has quite impact - or is able to, if you let it. Visually stunning and creepy as it can be. The pacing probably will be an issue for some, but it isn't for you, do it! Watch it - you should be able to tell, if you like this after the first 15 minutes or so. And you can watch it again and again - because while this is a horror movie on the surface, there is a lot more beneath it ..."
"'Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one\'s home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you\'re in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn\'t a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil\'s Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it\'s about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of why don\'t they just leave? Easier said than done, it seems. Oh, and that one masked girl... Holy god.'"
"In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes. The cinematography isn't bad with interesting camerawork at times. As for the acting I thought the two major characters played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku were very believable in their roles. Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie."
"Exploring themes of grief, trauma, immigration, assimilation, remorse & acceptance through a horror lens, His House is a haunting & harrowing depiction of the refugee experience and, in addition to capturing their inward & outward struggle in adjusting to new life in new place, also delivers as a thrilling & effective haunted house chiller.Written & directed by Remi Weekes, the film blends character drama & genre thrills into one finely layered narrative and holds nothing back when unleashing the terror that dwells within the walls of their new home. While there are times when the story becomes perplexing, everything adds up & makes sense once the full picture of the characters' backstory is revealed.The atmosphere within the rundown residence is palpably tense & often unsettling, and though Weekes relies on jump scares to frighten the viewers, most of them do work out in the film's favour. Wunmi Mosaku & Sope Dirisu play the young refugee couple seeking asylum after escaping their war-torn homeland, and they both chip in with performances that are credible, grounded & convincing.Overall, His House is a welcome entry in the world of horror and also marks a solid debut for Remi Weekes' directorial career. The proper care with which he sketches the characters' troubled past, vulnerable present & uncertain future, and brings it in sync with the immigrant issues gives his picture a relevant touch & relatable appeal. One of the better horror entries in Netflix canon, His House is certainly worth a shot."
"Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) discovers he has an illegitimate son in Queens who is to be his heir as his daughters can not rule by law. We first see the son (Jermaine Fowler) interviewing for a job with the son of one of the Duke Brothers (Trading Places). I am sure I missed some more homage stuff. Wesley Snipes plays the well dressed choreographed bad guy. The film is a who's who of black entertainment minus a few under contract to Netflix.The production was very funny. It speaks to woman's equality but not preachy and in that regard I wished they had developed the daughter more. The son was not what I expected. They had him as a techno geek and a small time ticket scalper, but neither one was ever used in the film. I would have expected some gut who was a street smart hustler, using those credentials to pass his tests.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity."
"'Now we\'ve all come across sequels, or remakes - reimaginings or reversionings - and wondered why? Well, this has to be one of the worst in recent times. Eddie Murphy\'s father - the luckiest actor in the film, James Earl Jones, is dying - but before he goes to spend more of his Darth Vader money, he presents his successor with a son he didn\'t know he had, who lives in California. Off he goes to fetch this young man Lavelle (Jermaine Fowler) and his larger than life mother Mary (Leslie Jones), brings them back to meet his all-female family in his Kingdom of Zamunda and all hell - accompanied by some horrific musical parodies of just about everyone from Gladys Knight to Nile Rodgers, with a bit of John Legend and Prince desecrated too - breaks loose. To be fair to Fowler, he is a good looking lad with some bemused attitudinal charm (particularly at bath-time), and there are some wonderful facial expressions from JEJ as he awaits death/relief from his coffin, but the rest of this just misfires on a pretty much continuous basis. The first film was very much of it\'s time, and that time is well and truly past...'"
"Sure the trailer is misleading it's more of a drama/thriller with a few horror elements so if you want a full on horror this isn't it. Jonelle MonÃ¡e is magnificent throughout really gives an extraordinary performance! The bulk of the movie is about trying to escape a slavery colony with some mysterious aspects mixed in there.The cinematography is absolutely incredible, would've been nice to see in the theater but at home on Halloween with a 4K TV was good enough and watched with my sister Emily along with our dog Lucas that was all delightful! Quite satisfied with Antebellum the way it plays out and I'd recommend it to anyone that might appreciates the film for what it is!"
"I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't."
If you compare this movie to the original it will feel less unique and may seem more deja vu. Of course it's a a chase movie with zombies. In that sense it has a Terminator feel. Things start off with an interesting premise - go back to get the cash since Zombies don't want money. Some faults. One thing I didn't like was the game where they fed humans to the zombies. Unnecessary. Also making them fight other bad humans was irritating. A lot of the movie is at night.\nThe good points are the ending wasn't irritating. No one likes too much self sacrifice. Kang Dong Won looks quite suitable in this role surprisingly. In the past he seemed not quite hero looking for action but here he is good. Lee Jung Hyun is quite a good heroine too.\nOkay for what it is. More conventional and less unique than the first movie. I prefer #Alive. But still an entertaining enough watch.
"Hollywood likes to portray Hollywood, like the narcissistic city that it is, and so from time to time you get these high budget, grand cast extravaganzas that do nothing but explain their place of origin. Mank is a black and white ode to the 30's Hollywood era, all wrapped around a conspiracy theory core. You get Gary Oldman playing the cowriter of Citizen Kane, the most important and beloved film that no one really watches anymore, and the story of how the story of this film was written. It wrongly assumes that you not only have watched Citizen Kane, but you are also familiarized with its history, the importance of the little details and the big personalities of the era. And therein lies its failure to connect to the audience.If you ignore that and you don't give a damn about Citizen Kane, you can enjoy a fast talked snapshot of an era film, very well acted and complete with references to events and political strategies that mirror the present. You need to watch it even if only to see that fake news is not something new to 2020. It may be a little too presumptuous, a little self absorbed, but a good film nonetheless. I am sure it's better if you know what the hell it is referring to, though."
"'Honest Thief is built around the conceit that bank robber Tom Dolan has found the perfect woman that leads him to renounce the world of crime and turn in the $9 million that he stole as the notorious In and Out Bandit.The woman is Annie Wilkins whom Tom meets while renting a couple of units to hide his loot at a self-storage site. The best scene in the film was the first encounter of Tom and Annie. The banter was lively and the chemistry apparent. That scene really jump-started the film.Tom\'s noble plan to make a deal with the feds goes awry when a couple of corrupt FBI agents attempt to steal the money, kill their supervisor, and blame the crime on Tom. Yet, like Don Quixote, the intrepid bank robber continues in his quest to make amends and cut a deal.The film was crisply directed with a lively pace and excellent location filming. The love theme was carefully balanced with the action sequences, and the result was a combination of heist film, thriller, and romance. Liam Neeson was outstanding in the role of Tom Dolan. Best supporting actor goes to Tazie the dog.While there may not be anything innovative about the film, the bottom line was that this was an entertaining synthesis of tropes from other action pictures with a standout central character of a thief with a heart.'"
"'Liam Neeson is the In and out bandit, robbing banks for years. He hasn\'t been caught, but when he meets the right lady, he decides it\'s time to give himself up; he tries to return the cash, but it doesn\'t go as planned. Co-stars Kate Walsh (probably best known as Doctor Montgomery on Grey\'s Anatomy) as Annie. Can he outwit the dirty FBI agents? He finally comes clean with Annie, but can he work things out before the FBI takes him out? It\'s fun. One of the two films directed by Mark Williams. Story by Steve Allrich and Mark Williams.'"
'3 out of 5 stars.Shadow in the Cloud is a fair action horror film about Chloe Grace Moretz character hitching a ride on a plane with a few soldiers. Needing to deliver a secret package in her luggage. While in the air they face against some gremlin like creature that is destroying the plane and fighting against other enemies that is attacking them in the air.Mix mash plot with a few cat and mouse fight with WWII air battles. Some horror thrills with a creature destroying there plane. While Chloe is locked in a gun cockpit.The script is cheesy with annoying irritating characters. And the dialogue is boring which makes you lose interest in whats going on.Chloe Grace Moretz is awesome in the role. Taking on an action role. The action is pretty decent and entertaining. It can be cheesy. The visual effects are cheesy too.'
"3 astronauts arrive at a space station to find a badly injured, unconscious 'stowaway' on board. The implications of having this additional person on board soon become clear.Whilst there are some really quite exciting parts in this film and a convincing / fascinating take off and docking, this is not your average space thriller. Instead it is a relatively gently insight into how professional people cope in extraordinary circumstances, leading to a pleasant albeit not wholly unpredictable ending. Not at all bad with a solid enough cast, it remains watchable if unremarkable."
"Undermined by leaving some big questions unanswered and a frustratingly abrupt ending, Stowaway is still a really good sci-fi drama that's emotional, engaging and tense. Anna Kendrick, Toni Collette, Daniel Dae Kim and Shamier Anderson are all incredible with excellent chemistry. Joe Penna's direction is fantastic, it's beautifully filmed and extremely well paced. The visual effects are impressive and the music by Volker Bertelmann is great."
"It was really nice movie. I can't say that this film is masterclass or masterpiece but it's standing above average,ordinary movies. Plot was interesting to watch and easy to fallow. Acting was on point,high quality. I would like it to be a little bit deeper and maybe had more harsh moments but it didn't disappoint me. The best film of 2021 so far."
"'Timberland is position as a comedian for the past 10 years in movie world. This performance changed himself to a real actor. Having said this kind of theme of an grown up with special past along with a special kids be filmed many times, but the focus more on the acting and how story been told. Patience required for this kind of movie.'"
"It's truly unfortunate the marketing campaign for this film couldn't have been stronger because this is a far cry from the childish films (and some of them work quite well) that illumination puts out on a year-year basis. Onward presents story beats that rival some of Pixar's best over the years with a touching final 15 minutes that catapulted this film up the ranks on this studio's finest work. And most of all, I think the film's ultimate message is one of utmost importance and something we can all learn from. Sometimes the very thing you've been looking for has been right there in front of you the entire time.8.8/10"
"'And as you would expect from Pixar, the quality of everything is really good! Be it characters, development, story, jokes, drawings/animation and much more. It really hits home (no pun intended) and always is able to touch your heart. While we are now housebound more or less and for the foreseeable future, this was nice to see in a cinema while I could.There are some cliches and some things that are predictable, but the movie builds a world that makes sense in itself and works within the rules it sets for itself. So yes suspension of disbelief, but a coherent one, where you can be sure that no rules it sets up are being broken (at least not in an overtly obvious way).'"
"'A fun and wholesome adventure to discover that sometimes what you always needed was with you all along. The story is a unique take on mythical creatures and magic, pitting ancient sorcery and new age technology. The characters are well developed and the storyline had good flow. Lots of fun and heartfelt moments. Lovely!'"
"Dame Kristin Scott Thomas follows in the footsteps of Dame Judith Anderson and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers.Unfortunately Armie Hammer has to follow Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Brett and Charles Dance. Well let's say that unlike Dance who was too old for the role. Hammer is about the age that Oliver was when he played Maxim de Winter.The story is about a lowly young woman (Lily James) who has a whirlwind romance in the south of France with wealthy widower widower Maxim de Winter.When the newly married Mrs de Winter arrives to his ancestral home Manderley. She finds that her naivety is exposed by Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper who was hopelessly devoted to Rebecca, the first Mrs de Winter who died in a tragic boating accident about a year before.It is a beginning of mind games between the two characters while Maxim seems to be haunted himself by Rebecca.Director Ben Wheatley has form with low budget English folk horror films. He also directed Peter Capaldi's feature length debut story of Doctor Who.With the help of a Netflix budget. Wheatley focuses more on the courtship in the South of France. There is a folk song played as the couple travel to Manderley which I thought will lead to an eerie Gothic atmosphere.There is a more lesbian subtext regarding Mrs Danvers and her infatuation with Rebecca.Somehow this is rather old fashioned. It is better than the 1997 ITV mini series but I expected more of Wheatley's own stamp."
"#ALIVE is a South Korean film with a very simplistic and familiar presence - a young man hides out in his apartment during a zombie apocalypse - that some have linked to the French indie THE NIGHT EATS THE WORLD. But then it is a very generic kind of premise that I had the idea of writing myself a decade or so ago. In any case, films like this live or die depending on the execution, and the good news is that #ALIVE is a winner thanks to plenty of hard work on the part of the director, who wrings maximum suspense, humour and action from that premise. It's fast-paced and engaging, saddled with an annoying but realistic lead who grows on you as the story progresses, and a great female supporting character. The zombies are the scary ones you'll remember from TRAIN TO BUSAN and KINGDOM, making this all the more gripping."
"This film exceeded my expectations tbh. It was suspenseful, thrilling amd never really ends up boring because of the fast pace. Absolutely smart with the technology-style but could've use more of that."
'Kevin Heart never dissapoints so far - even though this movie is not that typical comedy which Kevin is. But few joke lines saved it - so if you watch it with couple it will be a good one James Welch Henderson Arkansas 6/18/21.'
"Fatherhood is a 2021 Netflix/Columbia Pictures Comedy Drama starring Kevin Hart,Melody Hurd,Deborah Ayorinde and Alfre Woodard. Directed by Chris Weiz(who was\nthe writer for About A Boy) and based on a novel by Matthew Logelin titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir Of Loss and Love. The story is about Matthew Logelin(Hart) an African American who's been with his wife Liz(Deborah Ayorinde) since they were kids. However when Matt's wife is pregnant and has to go under a C Section for her baby,tragedy strikes when Liz dies leaving Matt heartbroken as he is left to rear his daughter Maddy(Melody Hurd) on his own without a mother figure for his child. While struggling with Maddy,Matt later meets a woman named Swan(DeWanda) and he strikes a relationship with her. But is he moving too quick or will he learn the challenges of being a single parent as well as facing obstacles along the way?Alot of people may be baffled as to why they cast an African American for Matt Logelin instead of a Causcian but I didn't pass any remarks on the casting for this film.Kevin Hart was very good in this film(he also served as a producer too with Chris Weiz), as I am so used to seeing him as the wise cracking buddy of Dwanye Johnson and being typecast in alot of his films.I've always loved Kevin Hart so that's why I watched it. If your a fan of Kevin Harts do check it out on Netflix.B."
"'Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the all falls apart felt forced and wasn\'t necessary.'"
"This movie stars a very fine actor who looks remarkably like the comedian Kevin Hart. In fact, he looks so much like Hart that the producers have tried to pass him off as Hart - no doubt to capitalize on Hart's popularity. I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut. This movie is not always easy to watch. But it is impossible to stop watching.If you don't like Kevin Hart's previous movies - and I didn't care for some of them - watch this. You will be amazed. If you did like his previous movies, watch it as well. You will also be amazed. It's an amazing movie."
"Yet another spin on superheros, 'Project Power (2020)' posits a world in which a new drug allows users to unleash their inner power - whatever it may be - for five minutes a pop. It's an interesting premise that, essentially, takes a traditional action-thriller and sprinkles some of the oh-so-popular superhero genre on top. It may sound cynical, but it doesn't feel it. It's generally an enjoyable time, despite its uneven tone and somewhat vague plot. It also has a few stand-out set-pieces which are approached in rather unique ways, such a hectic fight sequence that's only seen from inside a giant tank. The leads all do a good job with the material - though, Gordon-Levitt seems to think he's in a comedy - and the pacing is always tight enough to maintain engagement. It isn't going to get you thinking - in fact, you'll probably notice some plot problems if you do - but it should keep you entertained. 7/10"
"'Project Power is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ex-soldier, a police officer and a teenage dealer trying to stop a group of people from delivering a pill that gives to users unpredictable powers. They have to cooperate and trust each other if they want to succeed.I found this movie interesting but not something amazing or new since there are plenty Sci-Fi movies which have to do with superpowers and a way of gaining those. The interpretations of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Frank and Jamie Foxx who played as Art were good and the combination of them worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Dominique Fishback who played as Robin. All in all, I have to say that Project Power is a nice movie to spend your time with but if you are about to watch it, I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed by it.'"
More CGI than I was expecting but the CGI was really good. Not too surprising as they are doing man's best friend and they have it down packed. A new entry in this era of dogpilation has mega star Harrison Ford taking a back seat to a dog drawn on a computer and it's a warm tale that will definitely get dog lovers to cry.
"'There have been several movies Call of the Wild but this is the first time one has told the entire story in Jack London\'s book. The real main character is the big dog, Buck, and his transformation from house pet to sled dog to alpha male of his own hybrid Timberwolf pack.This movie in its form could not have been made with real dogs. Instead they used state of the art motion capture to generate realistic animation for the animals. This is covered quite nicely in a series of making of extras on the movie disc.Harrison Ford, almost 80 now, is very effective as the narrator and the old prospector that befriends Buck. This is a really good movie, at first the sight of an animated Buck threw me off but soon it made no difference, the story is so good.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped, not her kind of movie.'"
"This is a sanitized adaptation of Jack London's novel. It leaves out some killings. Buck, the wonder dog, is dog-napped and sent to Alaska where he excels and passes from one owner to another although no one ever really owns Buck. The film includes some minor narration. Geared for a young male audience, although anyone can enjoy it. Realistic CG.Jack London was an atheist and a socialist in case you were unaware."
"'This film start with the narrator talking about Branch and Poppy saving the trolls world in the previous film, and the introduction of a evil queen Queen Barb scene! As turnout, this film is about Poppy and Branch need to unite all the music trolls by defeat Queen Barb! Entire film full of music instrument flashing scene, and laughable scene! Make the film quite watchable! All the song sing in the film also quite connect to the scene! Make the film quite imaginable to watch! Laughable scene! Such as, Guy Diamond saying he is pregnant, Tiny Diamond pop out from his body right away! Branch and Poppy catching a fly look alike monster from Mr. Biggie! Father of Poppy eating the flyer reading by Poppy! Poppy throwing a stick from Branch\'s weapon box, the stick stuck at Mr. Dinkles nose!

Tresillo challenge the K-Pop gang a dance-off! At the end, Poppy defeat Queen Barb by breaking her ultimate chord\'s curse! All the music trolls unite at last! Still have a post credit scene! The Grizzly troll whining about he missing the trolls music party! That\'s it! A must watch animation film!'"
"Trolls World Tour (2020) is a movie I watched with my daughter as soon as it came out. The storyline involves a larger Trolls universe where you see how other trolls live. One group of trolls, into heavy metal, feel all trolls should live like them and sets out to make that happen. Can our friends from the previous trolls picture stop the invading trolls? This movie is codirected by Walt Dohrn (Trolls) and David P. Smith (The Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed) and contains the voices of Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) and George Clinton (Good Burger). The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10."
"'I hate to say this but i can say that this one is a little bit better than the first one, i don\'t know why but maybe because this is kinda my thing you know, Rock music, Classic music, Pop music, so i really really enjoyed this, and the weird thing is i got goosebumps like 4 or 5 time, it\'s crazy, i am not expecting that, and of course i really want to hate this sequel because the first one is just a great, beautiful, and fun movie but i can\'t, this is a really good and cool movie, and you know one of the coolest thing in here? Ozzy freakin Osbourne, yes even though he have a little part and dialogue he\'s still very cool here, Trolls World Tour is not a movie or a sequel that everybody can like but it can be great and likeable especially for those who love this kinda thing, highly recommended'"
"'Since i havent seen the first trolls film i went with this one completly blind i was only hoping that this film will have some cute moments or catchy songs,so did it have it,well i must admit that it did,songs even very famous in our world in film sound different but without disrespect or some hidden messages that arent for this kind of film,i can also say that designs of trolls are very unique an their hairstyles are very colourful and it did give movie a nice dose of said colour and life that breathes fast and engaging,trolls world tour isnt great or very good film it is watchable enterteinmant but it lacks supstance in storytelling to be something more'"
"Unlike so many of the shallow and unoriginal products we're bombarded with through the usual channels and distributors, this outstanding piece of sci-fi cinema brushes them aside with an imaginative story, great special effects, likeable characters and, above all, an engaging story whose message is as valid today as it is in the future earth where the story unfolds."
"'The chemistry between the two leads is so great. They are very convincing as lovers, which makes it particularly enjoyable to watch.'"
Sloane (Emma Roberts) hates being stuck at the kids table during another family Christmas. She meets Jackson (Luke Bracey) at a store return line. They both hate being single on the holidays and decide to be each other's Holidate.There are some good rom-com ideas. The meet-cute is good. It's almost a good rom-com. There are issues with the construction. The stakes are never that high since the ending is always inevitable. It's not all one thing and it's not all down to one person. The actors are fine. The filmmaking is functional. The premise has some problems and the writing is just a little bit off.
"The new Netflix Romantic comedy started so awfully (first 5 mins) that I wanted to turn it off, but for some reason I persevered and I'm happy I did. The piot is fairly original, the two lead actors work well together, it made me laugh and in general it had a good feel to it. A thumbs up from me."
"'Or should i say slainthe, that will sooth the action seekers. its got a vary cliched story, and some very staged and practiced fist fights and shootouts, but it has also got some glorious good twists in some of the fights and battles between the crooked crooks of bad criminals, bad coppers and convicted coppers. this made me actually laugh several times so the entertainment factor is really there.production wise its not a marvel, its a fast shifting ,block jumping charade of theme shifts and camera angles, loads of barking men and also women in nonsense dialouges, some of the lightsetting management and thereoff some of the camerawork are quite amateurish, it wont reack the top of a ten story building, because the elevator doesnt go farther than the 8th floor. the 9 and 10th are for the proffesionals that use their hands feet and head to make the difference in the cinematic world.but by all means its a peerworthy and honest thinks the grumpy old man, the acting are overall good with the stars well replaced by stunters at the most spectacular takes and moves. mr wahlberg is a lucky guy with his pretty common looks and appearances, so there are plenty people to take from to do his moves and cam from behind the back shots.its a recommend and a sequel will come....'"
Absolutely incredible cinematography probably the best aspect about it! I guess others are right about the story going nowhere but it was definitely nice to watch spontaneously with my mom which I don't usually well with being an aspie. The cast and epicness that occurs is magnificent! Definitely left me feeling uncertain in parts and slightly bored regardless I love a large portion of it.
"'I can\'t do it any more. Almost every time i watch a netflix movie, it\'s the same feeling: pointless. I am a self-proclaimed movie fiend. I watch hundreds of movies each year. And yet when it comes to having any kind of intrigue, netflix is completely incompetent. How many times can they make a movie fiend ask himself why am i watching this?as to this specific piece of netflix garbage. It\'s two parallel stories with some connections, but they\'re not dependent on one another. The characters might be (not really) but the stories are not. With a couple tweaks, each can be told without the other. So rather than feeling like one big story with two parts, it feels like two different movies. Neither of which are the least bit interesting or entertaining.I can\'t understate how boring this movie is. I had to force myself to finish it. They did an awful job of making me care. At all. About anything. Or anyone.The only thing of value here is some cool space shots. The end.I forgot to mention how many things it tried to steal from the GOAT movie Interstellar. Key word tried. For anyone who thinks this movie is good, i implore you to watch Interstellar. You will no longer consider midnight sky a movie (1 viewing, 6/18/2021)'"
"'The way back is a very watchable sport film that deals with sports aspects of a story but it also deals with more problematic issuses for our lead character and it shows how can that easily ruin peoples lifes but it also give us message that we can always recover from it and to continue in a new better way,affleck give perhaps his best performance in life and even if i know that he wont but it would nice that he wins some award for this film since he deserves it,this film follows some cliches that are typical for this genre and it didnt offered nothing new but it also give me good time in front of tv'"
"'Cosmic rays give a few sociopaths superhuman power which is used to disrupt Chicago as if they would notice. Emily (Octavia Spencer ) is a geneticist who develops a method to give normal humans super abilities. Her blue collar friend Lydia (Melissa McCarthy) accidentally gets strength leaving Emily with invisibility.This is a popcorn flick. For those who missed the overweight humor of Melissa McCarthy, it is back. Pom Klementieff who played Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy plays the villain Laser. Jason Bateman has a silly role with crab hands. I enjoyed the low brow humor of it all and the 80\'s music.Guide: No F-words, sex or nudity.'"
"'If your looking for a movie that does not tug at your heart, and just has fun with itself, then Thunder Force is that movie for you. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer have such awesome chemistry, and you can clearly see they are having fun making this.In a world populated by supervillains known has Miscreants, twohildhood friends(Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer) developed there own superpowers and become the superhero team known has Thunder Force, in hopes to take them down.An amusing superhero comedy, never tries to be anything more then just a fun film. The rest of the cast do well also, really letting there comic appeal shine through, like Jason Bateman and Bobby Cannavale.'"
"It's all highly cinematic (and exaggerated to an extent) and it's clichÃ©s galore in the characterization department, yet Happiest Season is a film that leaves you emotionally fulfilled. It follows the formula but adds ample doses of heart, making everything magically work. In this film, you'll witness brilliant performances from Kristen Stewart and Dan Levy. Their friendship (more than the film's core lesbian love story) is what stands out as a truly memorable story arc. The thing about the Caldwell household is that nearly everyone's got something to hide, and that makes it a little easier for writer-director Clea DuVall to collectively provide closure to their issues.Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart share decent chemistry as a queer couple. But I've gotta say those few scenes that featured Aubrey Plaza and Stewart make you feel like they had some totally untapped chemistry. That's for another film to tackle, I guess. Happiest Season is tonally all over the place, oscillating between wacky comedy and genuinely emotional moments. And as a Christmas flick, Happiest Season isn't technically the 'happiest' though it manages to get there eventually (after a lot of misery!). It's an enjoyable 100-minutes alright!"
"Happy couple Stewart and Davis go to Davis' parents for Christmas which is full of tradition, snobbery, family disagreements, old lovers and the father trying to get the nomination for Mayor. The real issue though is that Davis tells Stewart before they arrive that she hasn't told her parents she's gay, so Stewart reluctantly has to pretend to be her hetrosexual flat mate.As a drama about being yourself and understanding everyone's trial of life it works quite well. It is though supposed to be a comedy as well with Stewart and catty mum, Steenburgen both on good form. The comedy though switches off half way through and it all becomes pure drama, missing a number of opportunities. A well made festive drama with good performances all around, it's just that the balance is rather off kilter."
"I don't usually ship... but I ship Abby and Riley. Otherwise, this film is pretty good. Decent acting, typical storyline, and a great cast. Dan Levy steals the show and Kristen Stewart surprisingly displays a range of emotions. Well done all."
"What worked:\nSo what makes Mimi a great watch is an almost balanced perspective regarding the dilemma that appears at the last act of the movie. Of course it's an tearjerker at times with the execution but keeping the hopes alive, decoding them, and giving just reasonings for the perspective makes it an alive, scholar and beautiful watch. Rehman keeps the movie much alive with the score and music, an equally great work by the director. It would have felt flat had the performances were less powerful and dull. Kriti gave the best performances so far. Manoj, Pankaj and Supriya excelled very well in their parts making the overall movie a fine watch. I was pleasantly surprised by the screenplay of the movie especially its scope, layers and overall a balanced character portrayal\nWhat did not work:\nThere were some rooms for improvements of course but all the melodramas and tearjerkers were equally valid. After-all it's a local movie in the local context. The movie could still have been valid even without some scenes with sentimental values to cut down the runtime.Final verdict: highly recommended."
This movie has a great message. And first time I liked kriti's acting. As always pankaj is amazing. And all the actors did an amazing job. And above all music and background score by AR Rahman is Best. A must watch.
"'It is a family adventure, though a bit silly at times. The pop culture references are fun, especially the line about Chris or Liam. Overall, it is a brain off family film.'"
"'It is the Hanna Barbera cinematic universe. Already familiar with me, as a kid I used to watch the All Star Laff-A-Lympics cartoons.Made in CGI, you have the origins of how Shaggy met Scooby Doo. They even recreate the original title sequence in CGI.If you are eagle eyed you will spot references to Scooby Doo and other Hanna Barbera carton characters such as a poster of Hong Kong Phooey.More prominent is Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, Captain Caveman, the villain is Dick Dastardly and in due course Muttley makes an appearance.Dastardly is after Scooby Doo who is the last descendant of a dog that belonged to a famous warrior. Dastardly plans to use Scooby Doo to unleash the three headed Cerberus.The fun is Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the Mystery Machine gang. It is updated with plenty of pop cultural references.I thought Blue Falcon was the weak link, the plot was a bit naff but my children enjoyed it.'"
"Sacha Baron Cohen doesn't seem to have been in a rush to make a sequel to his hit 2006 movie, but when he got around to it he created a crazed masterpiece. Once again a Kazakhstan filmmaker comes to the United States and a very bizarre culture clash ensued. Once again the fictional story is furthered by people tricked into thinking they are involved in something other than a Cohen film.This time around Borat is joined by his daughter, Tutar, played by Maria Bakalova with the same mad, fearless verve as Cohen. They both start the movie believing that women are useless animals who should be kept in cages, but exposure to America gives Tutar an interesting story arc. Along the way we meet debutantes, conspiracy theorists, and a mix of lovely and awful people (who are sometimes the same people!).The movie is hilarious and utterly insane. Check it out!"
"'Borat\'s back and unless he can get his act together, hopefully for the last time. You would think, given the potential targets, (Trump, Covid), this could be the best Borat film yet and yet a lot of gags fall flat. Yes, i laughed and loudly every now and then but nowhere near as often as I thought I would. Still, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, to give it its short title, (and that title in itself reeks of desperation), is still worth seeing thanks to a brilliant, star-making turn from Maria Bakalova as Borat\'s daughter, Tutar.The very thin excuse for a plot has Borat revisiting America with said daughter in tow and a plan to offer her as a gift to VP Mike Pence, (yes, that\'s about as original as it gets). Needless to say, Pence isn\'t interested though his appearance does mark one of the film\'s few inspired moments so the sights are set on Rudy Giuliani who is either even dumber than we thought or a rather good sport for going along with it. The candid-camera style sequences still work but much of this looks rehearsed and the wonderful Miss Bakalova deserves better. Will she deserve the Oscar should she win? Probably not but I can certainly see a long future ahead of her.'"
"'Upfront, I think it\'s fair to say that I found this whole story rather dull and depressing. Indeed, for much of it I was wondering why on earth anyone would choose to take this story - full of pejorative and downbeat references - and dramatise it at all. The performances themselves, however, are much more fulfilling. Amy Adams is superb as the addict mother whose son is heading down similarly disruptive tram lines before the intervention of his feisty grandmother Glenn Close. Based on a true story, it relates the not insubstantial trials faced by the family as their dysfunctional unit tries to make some headway against seemingly insurmountable odds. Close is so unlike anything I have ever seen her in before: dowdy, strong, angry, flawed - but determined that despite himself (and his mother) her grandson J.D. (played well as a child by Owen Asztalos; less impactfully as an adult by Gabriel Basso) is going to try to make something of himself. The interweaving chronology of the narrative makes this a bit more interesting too, as they all have their demons to face down. Taken in isolation, the story is just a bit so what - but for once the dramatisation and screenplay give the talent plenty to work with and grim as it it, at times, it has engenders some feeling of redemption that helps it be a bit more than the sum of it\'s parts.'"
"'. . . (or its singular pronunciation) in her mouth, but that\'s exactly what many of the Haters seem to be doing with GRETEL & HANSEL. The only proper way to see this flick is AFTER you\'ve stayed up too late the night before (that is, when you\'re suffering from not getting enough sleep). That way, as GRETEL & HANSEL unspools and you\'re fighting to stay awake in one of those new, ultra comfortable plush reclining theater chairs, you\'ll be able to empathize perfectly with the challenges facing title heroine Gretel throughout this film. Like her, you\'ll be constantly wondering, Did I just see THAT, or was it only a dream? Just as a certain type of person used to enjoy those John Wayne Westerns with ALL punches pulled, what\'s there NOT to appreciate about a horror movie in which EVERY bit of foreshadowing and gore might turn out to be figments of someone\'s dream (either yours, or the film crew\'s)? So as the old witch is slowly incinerated at the end, pinned to the wall of her killing room, who can say that this scene is any more horrible than a piece of wood burning during one of those Yule Log DVDs?'"
"This 2020 horror film stars Sophia Lillis, Sam Leakey and Alice Krige based on the Grimm Fairytale. This dark version of the classic tale tells about teenage girl, Gretel (Lillis) who takes care of her younger brother, Hansel (Leakey). Soon, they stumble onto a mysterious house in the woods where an old woman, Holda (Krige) dwells. She welcomes them and provides plenty of food in exchange for them doing chores, but Gretel discovers that Holda is not whom she seems. This is an eerie flick with a decent cast, some creepy settings and a chilling score. You could give this a view if you're into supernatural horror or scary stories."
"'I enjoyed this movie. i liked the tone, i loved the music, and it was visually stunning. well made all around, and very different from normal horror movies (1 viewing, 10/15/2020)'"
"It looks good.I haven't read the book, but it's better."
"It looks good.I haven't read the book, but it's better."
"I watched the movie this morning and I put a review with a mixed response. Later, I realised that there are so many beautiful moments in this movie which I just can't forget and I realised that it's a pretty good movie than what I wrote in the first review. So I deleted it and I'm writing again. ATBP is far from perfect but the makers made sure that it's a pretty good YA romance. The performances are top notch and I'm a Elle Fanning fan way before. She gave a powerful and very good portrayal of Violet. Justice Smith also did a good job and he's good in emotional characters. Other than Elle Fanning, the best thing I liked in this movie is the music. The music is so sweet and mind blowing and will be in your mind for a long time and it's an integral part of the moving of the movie. The cinematography is also good and they have captured the places they go well beautifully. The movie starts so well and I liked the first half much better than the second. The setting up was so good upto their first kiss and after that the movie slows a bit. Overall, ATBP is a good, watchable movie. Some people may find it boring because it's slow in some parts but looking back at the final product, I'm more than satisfied."
"Don't get me wrong. the book was good. This just added more visual and emotion in my opinion as they were all well casted with actors that made the emotions come to life.To those who believe that in the movie we didn't find out about Fitch's mental instability until late, you clearly were not watching the signs right form the begining.7.3"
"'After Cassius Clay (Eli Goree ) defeats Sonny Liston (Aaron D. Alexander ) he has an after party with Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge ), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr., and no women. Malcolm X is a real party-poop and puts a dampener on everything wanting to talk about how evil white people are, while looking over his shoulder. All of the characters weigh in on the race issue. Cooke and Brown agree it is economic empowerment. Malcolm X draws a hard solid line. You are either for or against. And Ali is all about Ali.The fictional conversations were interesting and most likely more meaningful than the ones they really had that night. Well done.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
"'Obviously a labour of love for Oscar-winning actress Regina King, One Night in Miami is her film version of Kemp Powers\' play about a night in which Malcom X, Mohammed Ali, (or Cassius Clay as he was back then), Sam Cooke and Jim Brown got together in a Miami hotel room discussing their lives as well as the struggle for civil rights. It\'s fiction, of course, and could have been painfully theatrical but King opens it up beautifully and draws superb performances from the whole cast with Leslie Odom Jr\'s Sam Cooke, (surely the Oscar is his to lose) and Aldis Hodge\'s Jim Brown the stand-outs.Indeed it\'s very much an actor\'s piece and if the ground covered has already been covered elsewhere, this is material well worth repeating and as a piece of history that might have happened but didn\'t it provides much to ponder over. It\'s also hugely entertaining, funny and whip-smart, and by the time we get around to Cooke\'s rendition of A Chage is Gonna Come there won\'t be a dry eye in the house.'"
"I don't really like these works, assumptions of what it would have been like if it had happened, but the type of film needed, to never forget how evil we can be, a heavy film, racism hurts, in the little unfortunate comments, in the acts, in the looks, but the debate / clash of Malcolm X vs Sam Cooke was worth it, it was reflective, about success and investment, pleasing the whites or making a profit through them, emblematic, excellent production of what may have been that illustrious night... Beautiful, sad and tragic..."
"'An old school sit down drama where 4 actors battle it out for who has the best monologue and who can have the best reactions to said monologue? I\'m in. But in all seriousness, there\'s something so impressive about the way Regina King directs this tight what if? drama about the possibility that Malcom X, JIm Brown, Muhammed Ali, and Sam Cooke all hung out and discussed life one night. No matter what really happened, this film happened, and it was fantastic.8.4/10.'"
"I'm really surprised by the relatively low ratings this movie gets on IMDb. I wonder what people expect nowadays from movies like this one? A movie based on a true story, but most of all an incredible story, very well written and directed by Francis Annan, clearly someone who knows how to build a tension with just minimalistic elements in the plot. I sat at the edge of my seat for some parts of this very enjoyable movie. The cast was also great, with a Daniel Radcliffe that proves again that he evolved from Harry Potter to an all round actor. He can play about anything and he did a great job again. To me Escape From Pretoria is definitely going to end in my top ten movies of this year. If you're a fan of escape movies then you surely won't be disappointed by this one. It belongs in the list of great prison escape movies, and it's based on true events what makes it always better. The negative critics on here have no clue about good movies, just ignore them and give this one a shot, you won't regret it."
"'Escape from Pretoria will never win any Oscars but this heartfelt, social-conscious thriller, based on a true story and set in a South Africa under Apartheid, is a lot better than I thought it was going to be. As the title tells us, it\'s an escape movie, (obviously), and by their very nature, escape movies usually make for good thrillers and this is no exception. It\'s very exciting while not afraid to show the horrors of the South African prison system at the same time.Daniel Radcliffe and Daniel Webber are the two young white members of the ANC imprisoned for distributing anti-government propoganda and Francis Annan\'s film is about how they escaped from Pretoria Prison. Ian Hart and Mark Leonard Winter are other prisoners in on the plan. It\'s a very compact little movie though it\'s unlikely to cause Bresson\'s A Man Escaped, The Shawshank Redemption or Papillion cause for concern. That said, this is still edge-of-the-seat stuff, very skillfully done, and the performances throughout are first-rate. In the end, you might just say, it does what it says on the tin.'"
'I like the bit where they made all them keys out of wood.'
"A solid prison escape movie that supplies plenty of suspenseful moments and a fresh escape plan you can easily get behind. I found that it at times had a creative use of cinematography, and the score was suitably disturbing, somewhat similar to Psycho. Daniel Radclifffe really dissapeared into this role too; I was impressed.The film isn't astonishing or anything, but it's a job well done considering it's the first film from the director. Worth the watch if you're looking for some more new releases."
"If a horror movie visualizes something that otherwise would not and cannot be seen, is it something you like? And I'm not talking monsters in particular. Rather something that Imdb itself reveals almost instantly under the title. Having said that, the visual treatment and the allegories are there and ripe for picking an depicting. Doesn't mean it will float your boat or that youl will like the movie, especially considering the slow pace.Having said all that and with 3 female leads, this can annoy some people for different reasons. It would be a shame though, because if you are in the right mindset, you will be scared, entertained and have some food for thought too. Great performances all along from everyone involved. Try to go with the slow flow to get the most of it"

"It can be way too pretentious and theatrical at times but Malcolm & Marie is still a really good drama that's funny, stylish and extremely intimate with some insightful things to say about the film industry. John David Washington and Zendaya are both incredible with fantastic chemistry. Sam Levinson's direction is really good, it's beautifully filmed and well paced. The black and white aesthetic choice really works and the soundtrack is excellent."
"Yes day is a comedy family drama that shows what it will be like if parents were to allow their kids to have a day where they can't say no anything they ask, well of course there are some exception. This film looks nice, especially the suitably picturesque location work and the photography is never too drab or garish. The acting performance was pretty good; Jennifer Gardner was clearly having fun with her role as a strict yet lively mother of not one but three kids. Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart. It also didn't seem as cheesy or as sappy, or at least it didn't go too far on them, as other family drama films. Although the story is admittedly very predictable and has a lot of cliches, both deliberate choices with both being two things that the film is poking fun at, it for the last two acts is full of energy and charm."
'Typical family movie with family values and lessons of life. Definitely worth the watch with younger children.'
"'Moxie nails it in so many different aspects.Firstly it has a fantastic plot. It is well thought out, well executed, well scripted, and just enjoyable to watch. It will make you angry and frustrated at the world but will ultimately leave you with hope and promise after building to a heartwarming ending. The comedy elements work, the romantic storyline feels relatively authentic by teen movie standards, and the feminist message is well executed and powerful.The characters were all well done. Some were a little over the top and on the nose and I think it would have been interesting to bring in a few more male characters to explore more subtle instances of sexism and micro aggressions, but this is a relatively small criticism all things considered. The cast were all pretty solid, particularly the central performance of Vivian.The direction from Amy Poehler was great, carrying a great tone and style throughout the film. I loved the soundtrack as well which I think always elevates a teen movie a little more.I had a great time watching this film and think it delivered on its purpose very well.Most definitely worth a watch!'"

"I kept waiting for this movie to do something to distinguish itself. When it ended, I first thought that it was a bit too uneventful. But I think that was intentional. There isn't anything in this story that makes it feel like a movie script--no three act structure or big climax."
"You know that tingling feeling you get when you get a fright - a bit (I imagine) like getting a little electric shock? Well don't expect anything like that from this haunted house yarn. In this case, the malevolent spirit seems to have emigrated from Japan to wreak havoc on any who enter it's house. Andrea Riseborough is the new cop in town who sets about getting to the bottom of the mystery. It's not an awful film, it's just neither scary nor funny. It's great that movies like this continue to drive fans to see it at the cinema, and it doesn't drag - it's just a mediocre effort at best."
"'(Flash Review)Can a blind date that starts off as a catastrophe end up in true love? David Spade plays a middle age fellow who meets two women named Missy/Melissa, associates the wrong phone number with the wrong name in his phone. He thinks he is texting the hotter one to accompany him on a work vacation trip. When they meet up ON THE airplane, it is the weirdo Missy, from a bad blind date that shows up much to his shock and chagrin. Stuck now, he makes the best of it. She is super outgoing and he is not and she does many wild things around his coworkers. Will he find her actions irritating or will they eventually grow on him and help him break out of his more reserved shell? And what will happen with the hotter and more normal Missy? There are some funny jokes and scenarios and many of them hit; not all do. Lapkus steals the limelight from Spade as her character is supposed to. Overall, it is a better movie that Spade has been in for a with many solid chuckles to be had.'"
"'How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It\'s a relatively straightforward story of an hunter Goodfellowe who, along with his young daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young Mebh (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young Robyn and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who\'s angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live...'"
"'I saw Wolfwalkers, starring the voices of Honor Kneafsey-the A Christmas Prince movies, Miss You Already; Eva Whittaker-in her first theatrical movie; Sean Bean-Jupiter Ascending, Game of Thrones_tv and Simon McBurney-The Conjuring 2, Mission:Impossible_Rogue Nation.This is an animated movie about an Irish folk tale. In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it\'s not just one long tale-with the other two being \'The Secret of Kells\'_2009 & \'Song of the Sea\'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It\'s rated PG for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.'"
"'Many reviews focus On the visuals, and they are stunning. But the story is also immensely complex. With characters engaging in legitimate moral struggles and having to face the reality of their true motivations. Moving and thought-provoking, without the clip pop culture references.'"
"'When a space mission goes awry, the craft crash lands leaving only one survivor - the captain Konstantin Veshnaykov (Pyotr Fyodorov) who, on the face of it appears ok.

I actually quite enjoyed this. It has an authentic, almost bakelite, style to it - and that helps sustain quite a suspenseful sci-fi drama with the odd twist in the tail - and an alien that is a little more creatively designed that the usual bug-eyed nonsense. There is an half-decent sense of jeopardy as the look of the film, too - dark and dingy - helps generate an extra bit of menace. Certainly, it is a cannibalisation of a great many films that have come before; but that doesn\'t make it awful - indeed, though basic in it\'s premiss, the production standards are quite high and it sends a salutary signal to Hollywood that their days of producing derivative, old hat, sci-fi will have to change if they want to keep ahead of the game...'"
"'Greetings from Lithuania.Sputnik (2020) was a very good sci-fi movie. It reminded me heavily of Alien and Arrival. Its like an Alien and Arrival smashed into one and also set in a different place then usual. The place and time is 1983 and its Soviet Union - setting of sci-fi movie you simply won\'t see anytime soon. And this movie kept my attention during its whole 1 h 50 min. Its not just a monster flick - like i said the whole wibe of this movie reminded me heavily of Arrival - you kinda feel that there is more to it then it shows. Acting by two leads Oksana Akinshina & Fedor Bondarchuk were amazing in my opinion. Music at the end was haunting and directing of the whole thing was the thing that kept it going.Overall, Sputnik is a very good sci-fi / horror gem set in a very unique place and time. It borrows heavily from two masterpieces - Alien and Arrival - its not as great as those for sure, but i really liked Sputnik on its own - and the ending was very haunting + soundtrack was superb.'"
'3 out of 5 stars.Outside the Wire is a fair science fiction film that has a similiar concept like films Chappie or Robocop. Where a society is crumpling. Androids are taking over as militarized soldiers. And cyborgs being created.The plot follows a soldier Harp (Damson Idris) who made an irrational call on a operation. He gets reassigned to Leo (Anthony Mackie) who is an android soldier. And going to travel in a demilitarized zone to go after a terrorist group who are after nuclear codes.The plot is forgettable. There is a twist that does not make it any better. But plays with a concept idea of kill millions to save a better future idea.The action sequences is pretty decent and entertaining for action fans. Anthony Mackie does kick a** as an android soldier. Facing against bad guys. And other militarized robots. The visual effects are decent.The script does make the characters feel bland. And the direction is a bit flat. Which does not make the movie stand out or different. It does have some exciting action but story and direction does make this one film forgettable once it is over.'
"I liked this, having found many horrors in the slasher/mystery genre pretty disappointing in recent times, this was pretty decent. It's definitely flawed, so don't expect masses of tension, or any scares, but overall, it's solid.The one criticism I'd have, is that it's so slow to open up, that's the major issue with this film, you're waiting for an hour for the fun to start. The last half hour of the film is the best part, it is really good, and surprising.There are a few twists, and it does a god job at misdirecting you, a second would definitely work.I have to say though, Dan Stevens, is this really what you're going to be doing from now on in? You're better than this.Check out the actor under that mask, Anthony Molinari, a shame that face was hidden away for so long.If you enjoyed The Strangers, I think you may enjoy this.Pretty good overall, 7/10."
"'Now I am not familiar with the novel/source of this and when or how this was created. What I do know is that it does try hard to encapsulate and rip off Harry Potter and live off of that success. Now fair to say and as you can tell by the rating at the moment (which I matched), that most think they did not meet that standard by a longshot.Having said, the cast is not bad at all. The special effects are fine. So I can also understand those who maybe because they already heard so much bad things about this, went with lower expectations and actually liked this. But the cocky teenager that is fron and center here does not bode well, even if he has some good points he\'s making. So I don\'t think there\'s more to be said ... except that it looks unlikely this will get any follow ups soon ... (and watch the pitch meeting on Youtube which is as all their other Meetings super funny)'"
"Man, this movie is as scary and compelling as could be. In a display of the utter helplessness of the people who get caught in the middle of political warfare, Quo Vadis, Aida? Presents the despair and determination of one woman's struggle to keep her family safe by any means necessary.It's a heartbreaking movie, truly... And one that makes us appreciate the freedom from conflict and war we enjoy. Because the moment war is something you have to worry about, then you know your life is as disposable as the others to those in charge."
"It's hard not to be reminded of Schindler's List while watching this. That comparison doesn't help this movie, which can only pale comparatively (particularly in the filmmaking technique and style), but that doesn't preclude this movie from be effectively harrowing. When faced with an insurmountable, inconceivably inhuman tragedy, we are left with nothing but the desire to maintain as much of our life as we can, and Duricic carries that burden with immense power."
"'This film was much needed on the quarter-century anniversary of the massacre of Srebrenica, one of the most bloody pages of the most recent european wars, the Jugloslavian conflicts, that happened so recently yet are unspoken of.Zbanic\'s film is better described as a family drama that happens to be set during Srebrenica than a film about Srebrenica alone. Or better, it is a film that is able to portray the events of Srebrenica yet focus on the personal story of a handful of characters.The main character, Aida, is an interpreter for the UN military unit that was sent to Srebrenica in 1995, and is determined to save his all-male family from the butchery of their invaders. Her character is the center of virtually everything that is depicted, and allows to give a wide glimpse at the most recent genocide occured on european soil. While several of the main characters are invented, they interact at various points with really existing people: Mladic, the butcher of Bosnia, colonel Karremans of the UN military division, among others.One element which I found relevant was how the film underlined the fact that the post-jugoslavian conflicts were a conflict between neighbours, between people who belonged to the same communities, and the epilogue depicts this in a most shocking way.'"
"Powerful story told very well. The emotion was just amazing. I knew nothing about the real world events that this film is based on, and I feel like that's a problem. A lot more people should know this story. This is a difficult watch that is bolstered by top tier filmmaking and acting. Overall, I thought this was a great film. It's a very important story told very well, and it definitely deserved its Oscar nomination."
"'The White Tiger is the antidote to Slumdog Millionaire. The latter film feels like a bunch of white guys appropriating Indian culture to tell their version of a fairy tale. The White Tiger, by contrast, feels like a movie about India made by people who understand India.It\'s an energetic, exuberant movie about the desperation that drives a poor ambitious man from a small village to murder and eventually a life of wealth and privilege. It\'s a dog eat dog story, almost literal in its telling and lacking any nuance, but pretty entertaining. It also feels very familiar to those of us living in places like the United States, where the lip service given to words like democracy, freedom, and capitalism are belied by the reality of those who have trampling over those who have not in the race to get even more.I enjoyed the glimpses of modern-day India that this movie offered, even if they convinced me it\'s not a place I\'m in any hurry to visit soon.Grade: A-'"
"'Comic film that manages to give prestige to a not particularly imaginative but particularly amusing comedy. The whole movie makes you laugh and entertain a lot, a really good comedy movie to watch with friends.'"
'The cast was brilliant and there were lot of plot twists in this movie. A good drama plus thriller. A decent movie . Ending was good too. Lots of emotions and heartbreaks are there too.'
The writer should make Rom-Coms or full on comedy entertainers. Crime thrillers are not her forte.The plot stands on the lousy Forensic work or the non existence of it.The jokes were so good though. I laughed a lot. It can be good if you don't look for logic.
"'This is one insane Bollywood thriller - you\'ll might love the movie after seeing the unexpected finale. The film is enjoyable to see for its clever use of 135 minutes to blend suspense with sarcastic humour.There are actually three winners in the movie. Apart from Taapsee Pannu\'s powerful performance and Vikrant Massey\'s brilliance, there is Kanika Dhillon\'s writing which is very brilliant.Yes, there are flaws in the script and the story but despite its flaws, Haseen Dillruba is a pleasant watch.'"
Story isn't awful but it's lengthy. It could be due to the 3 or 4 music video montages. It seems that a lot of Bollywood films have these montages but I'm not used to them. I liked it regardless.
"'Everythiing in america is big, the slogan has flashed over us for nearly 200 years, and this pickeled time traveller really grasps the big apple head on.its a witty, and actually quite funny look at how the american world have changed for a methusaleh aged eastern jew, they have made great vfx and done a pretty good research on product development, i remember the first time i used the seltzer water machine myself , a prototype soda stream 1980 model, and how my finger and body waited for the snarling stuttering puffs when the machine hgad done it ready, shock and awe, made in america.its pretty well acted, the jokes hangs really loose, the irony at its best and the opening section really shuffles the way open into maybe the comedy of the year.the grumpy old man, not a seth rogen fan usually, opens up his doors for more of this neolittic fus farsing. its well worth a watch. a recommend'"
"'Its basic virtue is the large freedom proposed to viewer. The liberty to chose the fair perspective, from nice comedy, clash between generation, best performance of Seth Rogen, decent descending in Jew tradition, sentimental portrait of a life face to new challenges, the life lesson, the nostalgia about lost worlds and irony about present one, the old influence of Hibernatus by Edouard Molinaro . So, generosity as the precious gift .'"
"I didn't even know Coppola directed this when I started watching it. I selected it from one of my online subscriptions only because Murray was in it.Twenty minutes into it I was totally uninterested in Dean, Laura's hubby, alleged infidelity and Laura's boring and stressing life as an upper class NewYorker with two young kids.Enters Murray, as Felix, Laura's eccentric father, bringing some sparkles to the stale story. Yes, Felix is a womaniser but he's also charming and sophisticated and basically the only interesting character of the whole movie.Felix forces Laura to go into a private investigation on Dean and the two share some bizarre conversations about the eternal male-female struggle.Half way through, I got a hunch of how this was going to end and caught the bull's eye, so I lost interest because the whole chase is just an excuse to debate trite issues about relationships, with a politically correct twist.On the positive side, the photography is nice, with some beautiful settings but that's all and even Murray cannot save this boring and predictable truckload of cliches.It is now final: Sofia Coppola has nothing left say. She's even started pilfering from Bridget Jones' story line..."
"'I guess many Apple viewers were suspecting to see a straightforward, simple and funny comedy, which it isnt. So beware, this movie is only suited for the art house movie fans of subtle character portraits.The good: Bill Murray, Bill Murray, Bill Murray.Any bad? Director Sophia Coppola has got a slowburning and mellow kind of directing, which many apperently find quite a bit boring, judging by the many other negative reviews. I love this particularly slow and mellow directing style though, because it gives the characters in this story room to breath and be real persons. So many comedies are only eager to score with making blunt jokes, but this is more of a subtle melancholic comedy/portrait, with real persons, with real life insecurities. Perhaps better suited for an older, middle aged audience?The story: a portrait of a married woman, stuck in a rut, who is doubting if her husband is having an affair. Her (hilarious) dad, played terrifically by Bill Murray, starts acting like a private investigator, following the whereabouts of her suspiciously acting husband. Did he cheat or didnt he?'"
'Da 5 Bloods (3.5 out of 5 stars).Da 5 Bloods is a pretty fair war drama film. About foue Vietnam vets that go back to the jungle in modern time to search for their best friend remains while searching for hidden treasure they buried.The plot is good also focusing on modern times of race and black lives matter concept. The film also shows the struggle each vet is going through mentally and physically. Delroy Lindo delivers a powerful performance that he is struggling with. The cast is good with there performances.The film does have a sense of style with Spike Lees direction with the narrative switching between Vietnam war to present day. I did not think this was Spike Lees best movie. But it was entertaining. I did have issues with how long the movie was. It was overlong and needed some editing to help with the pacing.'
"'Da 5 Bloods is a Drama - Adventure movie in which we watch five veterans returning to Vietnam in order to find and retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader. They will also search for a gold they hid there when they were fighting.I liked this movie very much because it had an interesting plot with plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Spike Lee was very good and I believe that he did a great job on combining some dramatic moments with action. He also did something that I have not watched in any other movie, he kept the same actors to play in some flashbacks without making them look younger, something that I found very interesting and new. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to say that I enjoyed very much the interpretation of Chadwick Boseman who played as Stormin\' Norman and it was one of his last interpretations. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Clarke Peters\' who played as Otis, Delroy Lindo\'s who played as Paul and Isiah Whitlock Jr. who played as Melvin. Finally, I have to say that Da 5 Bloods is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everyone could gain something by watching it.'"
"Pretty typical and brings nothing new to these sorta films, but it still has more to it than I was expecting.I had predicted it was going to be a full-on forced comedy and cringe teen romance, but it actually has a little bit more substance to it. Added to the fact that none of the cast irritated or annoyed me, which is always a positive. You can guess what's coming up from minute one, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it - albeit to a minor degree.Aimee Teegarden (Nova) and Thomas McDonell (Jesse) are a decent enough pairing, while the characters of Danielle Campbell (Simone) and Joe Adler (Rolo) are more interesting than they seemed to be early on. Dean Norris, midway through 'Breaking Bad' at this point in his career, also appears.'Prom' may have absolutely nothing special about it and is very plain, but I'd very much be lying if I said I disliked it to be honest. It's passable."
"'I was a bit hesitant in liking this in the beginning, but definitely warmed up towards the middle. This reads very much like a Broadway musical, snappy tunes and message heavy. Fairly like-able, fun teen lead, adults were okay.'"
"This film is so beautiful. The sets, the songs and the message are all so beautiful. I was so touched. I even watched the credits because I didn't want it to end."
"'The Prom is a Drama - Musical movie in which we watch two self-obsessed theater stars trying to help a high-school girl going with her girlfriend to the prom. They have to change their behaviors and truly help the girl if they want to change as persons.I liked this movie because it presented very well a serious social topic from different perspectives while it consisted of some sarcastic scenes about celebrities and famous people in general. The interpretations of both Meryl Streep who played as Dee Dee Allen and James Corden who played as Barry Glickman were very good and they both did a very good job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jo Ellen Pellman\'s who played as Emma Nolan and Keegan-Michael Key\'s who played as Principal Tom Hawkins and they were equally good. To sum up, I have to say that The Prom was not exactly what I was expecting but I have to admit that was good and I recommend everyone to watch it.'"
"A cute action comedy that hit all the notes. The cast had great chemistry and the comedy landed. The storyline was fairly predictable, but it didn't need to be more than it was. Truly enjoyable."
"I was looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres. Becoming a huge fan of Dave Bautista, The actor so I actually could not wait to see this family friendly picture.\nIt seems almost mandatory that a ex-wrestler needs to star in a family friendly movie , especially if Bautista wants an acting career as big as the Rock (who did Tooth Fairy) John Cena (Who just did Paying with Fire) or dare I say it...Hulk Hogan (Every movie he ever starred in).I won't spoiled the movie for you, because I don't have to. We've all seen this movie so many times that you already know the Spoiler Alert just by watching the trailer.Typical tough-as-nails action hero type being soften by his awkward interaction with a smart aleck little girl (it usually is a girl).I will say that Bautista does bring his own flavor to the formula and despite telling the same jokes over and over again, he's not bland. Plus his chemistry with the little girl is good. Makes it a feel good movie.It's also a fun movie. Lots of laughs and very exciting, just like a wrestling match, so it works that one of the best wrestlers in the biz is the star of it."
"The Kissing Booth 2 had had plenty of ups and downs. First, Lee and Rachel. Their relationship was not what I expected after watching the first movie. I actually was extremely annoyed by her and thought she was trying to make him decide on his best friend or her.\nSecond, Elle and Noah. Their relationship was a mess but the chemistry was on point this time around. I felt myself liking them a lot more, which is funny since they broke up in real life when filming this. The whole situation with a Chloe and Marco was just a disaster and nothing is really explained. It definitely felt like something was missing. Noah's facial expressions were not matching with what he was saying at all.\nThird, Lee and Elle barely had any screen time together. I wanted to see more friendship moments with the two of them.\nAnd lastly, I didn't feel it with the new cast. Marco and Elle I was just not liking at all. I mean clearly he was the better guy but I just didn't feel any chemistry. Chloe was flirting way too much with Noah. It was honestly disgusting.\nOverall, I really enjoyed the real life situations being used on this movie."
"Somehow the first film was under my radar. Elle (Joey King ) spends the entire summer before her senior year in High School having premarital sex with her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi ) before he leaves for Harvard. Elle then spends too much time with Lee (Joel Courtney) which causes drama with Lee's girlfriend, Noah has a hot female friend at Harvard which causes teen angst and Elle has a hot dance partner which upsets Noah. The drama was comical for a guy my age, but I am certain the teen ladies ate it up.Not for me. Let me know when Joey King gets her nose fixed."
The Kissing Booth 2 is the sequel to the 2018 romantic teen comedy starring Joey King and Jacob Eldoldl. Ellie and Nat have parted due to leaving for Harvard. Still missing him she goes to Boston to find him but when she does meet him she's convinced that Nat is cheating on her with another girl called Chloe. Meanwhile Ellie meets Marco and shares a bond with him.Will she break up with Nat or will she go with Marco.
"Inspired by true events The Banker shows how in a not that distant past black people just didn't have the same rights and opportunies as white people. Nowadays there is some progress made even though there are still a lot of people that will judge people just by the color of their skin and that without knowing the person. There always will be people that base their judgement of somebody by the color of their skin, racism is for dumb people and dumb people we will always have. That said this story is worth to be told, and definitely helped in giving everybody, no matter what race or religion you belong to, a chance to have equal opportunities and rights to make money or to live where you want. Great job from Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Hoult and the rest of the cast, excellent acting from their part. George Nolfi made this movie most enjoyable to watch. The movie deserves a high rating and certainly doesn't deserve negative reviews."
"'The Banker is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the real story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who built their business empire by hiring a white man pretending to be the head of their businesses.I liked this movie very much because it was based on a simply amazing true story. The direction which was made by George Nolfi, it was very good and I liked very much that in the end of the movie showed us real photographs of the real people. The interpretations of both Samuel L. Jackson who played as Joe Morris and Anthony Mackie who played as Bernard Garrett were very good and I was really surprised by the interpretation of the last. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Nicholas Hoult\'s who played as Matt Steiner. To sum up, I have to say that The Banker is a nice movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it because everyone needs to know about this story.'"
"'Based on a true story, The Banker is the interesting tale of achievement against great odds. Bernard Garrett is a young and ambitious black man in mid 20th-Century America. Intelligent and driven, he moves to Los Angeles and plans on succeeding in the real estate business. He meets Joe Morris, a successful local black businessman whose loquacious and flippant personality couldn\'t be more in contrast to Garrett\'s stiff and nerdy character. After facing inevitable resistance in getting started Garrett overcomes his intitial dislike of Morris and resumes communication with him. The two strike a deal of purchasing properties around the city and decide on using Matt Steiner, a white colleague of Garrett when the latter was working a menial job as a handyman as a front while calling the shots behind the scenes. Events go swimmingly well for the men as success and wealth are for them to be had. After a visit back home to Texas Garrett decides to buy the bank in his hometown. That\'s when things start to get interesting. Featuring good acting and an in depth glimpse into the banking world the movie is an effective observation and critique on history, finance, race, gender and friendship. Simple and watchable, The Banker is solid history and filmmaking that touches on timeless topics inherent in the human experience.'"
"'The banker is a film that starts quality cast,mackie was always actor that was more for comedys and mcu guy,but here he give one very good performance maybe the best i seen him in,samuel l jackson was again enterteining and most fun to watch of all three actors,while hoult maybe overshadowed he still give solid performance,banker isnt special film by any means,it has stories that are been explored before and some of its repiptivnes was tiresome in scenes,but i can also say that this movie was good as its material was,and that is film biggest praise,if you watch you wont get something astonishing but you could still have good time'"
It's a well played film of an interesting story of true events that kept my interest throughout
"'The Half of It is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch a boy trying to express his feelings to a girl with the help of another girl who is secretly in love with her. Everything becomes even more complicated when all their relationships reviled.I liked this movie because it was very different than the previous romantic movies that I have watched and it had some plot twists that I did not expect. I also believe that the direction which was made by Alice Wu who is also the writer, it was very good and she did a great job on it. The interpretations of both Leah Lewis who played as Ellie Chu and Alexxis Lemire who played as Aster Flores were simply amazing and in addition to the interpretation of Daniel Diemer who played as Paul Munsky which was equally good, made this movie very interesting and fun to watch. Lastly, I have to say that if you want a nice and funny movie to watch then you should definitely watch it.'"

"A mostly formulaic rom com is given a jolt of originality by recasting the Cyrano in this retelling of the Cyrano de Bergerac story as a young Chinese-American woman awakening to the fact that she is a lesbian.This movie is likable and watchable, if not addictively so. Much of it is breezy, while little of it is confidently funny. Some of the jokes land, some don't. But's it's sweet and positive in its messaging, and sweetness and positivity are welcome qualities in entertainment these days, when both are in short supply pretty much everywhere else.Exactly the kind of made-for-Netflix movie you would expect it to be.Grade: B"
"There's a great movie inside of The Half of It, and Wu is a tremendous talent who shouldn't have to wait 15 years to make another feature film. Like too many Netflix movies, this one feels like the script needed a few more drafts."
"'I\'ve seen this movie because of its controversy, wanted to see if it\'s really as shocking as everyone says. I don\'t know, maybe I grew up in Indonesia\'s culture, so it\'s so provocative for me. Good coming of age story, but no matter the message of a story, for sexualizing children (even in acting) is wrong, but it\'s 2020 after all.'"
"The story is the story of the mother, not the daughter. Yet, at a certain point somebody decided that sexing up very young women would make it a way better movie. I simply don't get French cinematography in the last two decades. So many movies who lack a plot, but are very concerned with the sex lives of people 6 to 16.As for empowering women, this is the precise opposite. It simply plays the role of the abusive old woman who would cut the clitoris off the young woman if she were from East Africa instead of West Africa. It is about keeping women in their place, obedient and voila! you get bliss."
"I knew nothing about this film before watching it except that it sexualised children. However I wanted to know what the hulla baloo was about because Hollywood has been sexualising them for years.\nAs it turns out i think this is a fantastic film with a really strong message that the overly dramatic and faux moralistic brigade will have missed because they don't think further than a Sun headline.\nI could talk all night about how this film simply shows in very clear terms what society is doing to our kids, but the ones who need to listen won't.\nIf you want this type of film, which reflects real life, to stop, then stop Rihanna who's very highly sexualised moves has inspired young pre teen girls for years. Stop Rihanna, stop Miley Cyrus, stop all of the people who basically sell their sex and inspire ever younger children to emulate them.\nThis film does not sexualise young girls, it shows how the world is sexualising pre teens. If you want to find fault find fault there."

Too sweet and teen for this one. I keep my patience to watch this for 30 minutes and can't last til the end. The background just sooo sweet and girly which I'm not the target audience. But the quality of this upholds certain movie standards and can tell it's well planned.
"'What a beautiful song to conclude this sweet series adapted from the YA novels by Jenny Han To All The Boys I\'ve Loved Before. While not as strong as the first movie, this third and final film in the trilogy was better than the second film. There were some great Seoul travel shots and some wonderful shots of New York City...but ultimately this was the final entry in Peter and Lara Jean\'s romantic love story that started with a bunch of love letters and a fake relationship...and is concluded in this film which starts with The Covey (Lara Jean\'s) Family in Seoul, Korea for spring break. The big highlights in the film are the senior trip to New York, finding out about college acceptance, the prom, Dr. Covey\'s wedding, and graduation. This film is like a post card for high school romance and doesn\'t delve too deep into any heavy topics, although they do make an attempt to heal Peter\'s relationship with his father and touch on the Covey family grief in regards to their mom.Sweet, good hearted escapism and perfect Valentine\'s tribute!'"

"'The Lovebirds is a Crime - Comedy movie in which we watch a couple getting into a murder mystery by mistake and the are trying to find out who is behind that murder. In the meantime they don\'t know what to do with their relationship because they think that is over.I found this movie interesting and funny, it is a good average movie to spend your time with. It has a simple plot but with some plot twists that makes it very interesting. The direction which was made by Michael Showalter was good with many nice scenes combined with action and comedy. Regarding the interpretations, I have to mention Issa Rae\'s interpretation who played as Leilani and she was simply hilarious, and Kumail Nanjiani\'s interpretation who played as Jibran and he was equally good and funny in many moments. Finally, I have to say that The Lovebirds is a good, funny and interesting movie to spend your time with.'"
"'This is a far fetched story, but it is funny. It delivers laughs.'"
"'Relax and make you laugh at weekend is the objective of this movie. Just treat as comedy and enjoy, this did make me laugh.'"
"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about brewing romance between couple who have witnessed cancer. First 70 percent highlights the young nature of romance full of masti. The next 30 the emotional side.I have seen the English version as well. The bollywood version fell short of 25 minutes. It created doubt. To add further we even have songs. But then trust me quality was not compromised.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The execution is precise. The couple along with other actors and filming locations look great.Music: The song maskhari is played along twice, the first time it hits the right notes. Second time however it is played when emotions run downside, trying to cheer. Overall even after coming from Rahman music was average.Acting: Sushant stood exception. All others were justified.Final Verdict: A story which promises balanced destiny and maybe a good afterlife if we see the bigger picture accompanied with faith. It's a top notch romance one must not miss."
"It's rather difficult to review Dil Bechara (My Helpless Heart) in the aftermath but from an objective view, it only manages to engage you with its fabulous music, the lively lead and supporting performances, and the camera work. It is evident that the film was bludgeoned in the editing to make it appropriate but it still retrieves the melodramatic pulp which will make it a much more emotional and touching watch for early millennials. For everyone else, it's touchy-feely with overenthusiastic characters working on a plot that has been said and told numerous times now. But still there's something delightful in Dil Bechara that reignites the magic of John Green's The Fault in Our Stars that the Hollywood adaptation lacked. TN."
"Even though the film's spirit and breezy pace triumphs, the melancholy that augurs it, will leave you in a puddle of emotions and with a heavy lump in your throat as the end credits roll. 'Dil Bechara' will always be remembered as Sushant Singh Rajput's swan song. Watch this movie simply to witness Sushant Singh Rajput's last act. A brilliant one at that."
'No reviews for this one.. This movie will hold special place in our hearts forever. The everlasting smile of Sushant Singh and the energy he had in the movie. We will watch it again and again for Sushant.'

"I watched this movie last night and was inspired by the theme: if you are willing to do something, your dedication will bend the fortune to fall at your feet. This movie is same: dedication, hard work, not to give up, and of course for a good cause. A person's dream to launch a low cost aviation turns true after a lot of turmoils and hiccups.Acting, screenplay, explainations, and continuation were all good and well done. Suirya's acting, by default, was again great.Now, when you create a movie you tend to put some masala, unnecessary churns, villainous events, and emotions; otherwise, how can you showcase it to the audience. The same falls for biopics. I will say for sure that this movie can't be 100% ture, but again, for me what valued most after watching it was inspiration and motivation. And off late, after watching pathetic biopics like Saina, i can definitely say that this one gets my hats off.A must watch."

What a movie for us to feel patriotic on this Independence DayThe makers have really worked hard on this plot the director Abhishek has left no corner to cover about this sequence of warIt is shooted so widely with great VFX work you will feel as if you are seeing a Hollywood movie like top gun..the air fights are extremely mind blowing..the airbase and army base with the firings shown gives a thumping punch with background scoresAjay's voice gives a effect of a true brave soldier and he acted at his best with sanju baba and othersIt is far better than shershaah and offer our salute to our national hero's by watching this movie.
A good and different kind of plot with some new story. Yes there were some weak CGI scenes but atlast it's a good movie which you can watch with your family.
"Aktar is convincing as the rugged henchman turned into a boxer.His moves in the ring are genuine and he never fails to impress with his physical transformation.His talent as a subtle actor makes the already dramatic movie yet more realistic n he naturally blends the violent goon turned into a civilized boxer who is madly in love with his wife.This may be a movie about boxing but I was mostly in awe by the potrayal of the prejudices n biases against a particular community, most filmmakers n actors lacks the courage to show the harsh realities plaguing the diverse n amazing India.The movie has fascinating economic and cultural underpinnings.Director Rakesh Mehra continues to blow us away with his direction. The guy knows how to reinvent genres and do things in new and interesting ways.One repeated effect that I really enjoyed was the way the director handled the boxing choreography.Most of the reviewers who gave negative ratings n reviews are the fascist bigots who all are jealous.I am 101 percent sure that the fascist bigots who gave negative reviews and ratings are jealous cos they don't have good physiques, they have short and flaccid assets."
"NO TIME TO DIE (2021) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Magnussen, Christsoph Waltz, David Dencik, Ana de Armas, Dali Benssalah. Craig's swan song as 007 delivers all the goods with his brute force tactics and surprising vulnerability are on tap when his services are requested after 5 years retirement to stop baddie Lyutsifer Safin (silky Malek) from infiltrating a deadly nanobot virus via DNA into the world populace while also nursing his love for Seydoux who is in the mix in oh so many ways. Filmmaker Cary Joji Fukunaga (who collaborated on the screenplay with Nal Purvis, Robert Wade and Phoebe Waller-Bridge) infuses death-defying set pieces with visual flair to spare (best viewed in Imax) as well as some much needed dry wit and humor."
'It takes 30 minutes to get to the opening credits. We discover Bond has a love in Madeleine (LÃ©a Seydoux) and we discover she is the daughter of Spectre. After a near death experience Bond places her on a train and goes and lives on an island somewhere. He is drawn back into service with the re-emergence of the Heracles project which targets DNA and uses nanobots. Oh yeah. There is a remote island with a sinister lab on it.I am weary of the whole Spectre fight. The new personal aspects of Bond bored me. Daniel Craig is classless compared to Sean Connery and gets his hands way too dirty. The opening theme was lousy. It was certainly no Diamonds are Forever. And the ending? Geesh. You thought fans were upset when Judi Dench was axed. I did like Ana de Armas as Paloma for the short time she was on the screen. Why didn\'t they write her a larger role? She would have been great during the end scenes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'
"'Awesome single-location movie, keeps you glued to the screen and emotionally invested throughout. The performance by jake gyllenhaal is phenomenal, no surprise.

'It was a good film. Not the second coming of Christ as many procalime it to be but it was intersting and simply perfect eye candy. Denis Villeneuve truely knows how to make a film visually attractive and he is quite in line with Christopher Nolan in that regard. Also his directing style more and more becomes similiar to that of Nolan although he is a little darker.I never saw the origianl and never had the ambition to do so I cant really compare them but I also dont think they were supposed to be compareable as this is a new interpretation of the source novel.Acting wise it was good. I liked Timothee Chalament who made more out of his character than the screenplay offered him to do. Nice character development. Rebecca Ferguson is always good to see in a majro role. She had some really good moments. Zendaya was a bit one note but very pretty on the eyes. Josh Brolin was kind of wasted although he had a very interesting approach for his character. Oscar Isaac and Jason Marmoa were both good. The best of the supporting cast was undoubtly Javier Bardem.I loved the cinematography and the visual effeets are some of the best of the recent years. Technically it was clearly a masterpiece and I dont think anything will beat it in this regard in 2021.'

"'\'Dune\' is a stunning, gourgeous looking Sci-fi Epic that faithfully adapts source material into the Big screen with class and craft. Villeneuve shows why he is a masterful filmmaker. This movie deserves to be witness in the biggest screen with the loudest sound system possible, not on TV. Because of its impressive photography and scenography. Because of the scoop of its ambition captured in widescreen shots. Because of a gargantum score by Hans Zimmer that will stay with you long after listening it. It has minor flaws: some characters are more glorified cameos without a proper storyline. But with all the things that could have gone wrong with this movie, that\'s a flaw easily forgettable. And this is world so Big, so ambitious that as Zendaya says closing the movie: This is only the beginning.Warner, don\'t be stupid and make Part II as soon as possible. I want to see how this story goes further.'"
"'The Duke (Oscar Isaac) is sent by the empire to take control of the spice operations on Arrakis, which sounds like Iraqis. It is inhospitable and the locals have seen empires come and go who try to rule over them. (Reminded me of Afghanistan.) The Duke wants to have peace. The Duke\'s son Paul (TimothÃ©e Chalamet) is the main character and has too much of his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) in him. She comes from a long line of witches and he has some of their powers such as The Voice and The Sight which is similar to The Force. He dreams of a girl (who doesn\'t?) and of things to come. As it turns out, the empire was quite honest with them.I have never read the book. Three of us watched the first one on VHS and fell asleep during the film. The machines looked like they came out of Star Wars. They needed some good music background.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.'"
"'This is what do you know? A movie based on an original idea! The premise is that Blue Shirt Guy is an NPC in a video game and comes to realize that he\'s a video game character. He falls in love with a real life person in the game who\'s trying to find evidence that the real life creator of the video game stole his idea from them. The best part is easily the ending, because you find yourself so rooting for this character. Ryan Reynolds is absolutely amazing.The funny thing is that the beginning with more of the action is the weaker half! We get into a ton of great character development as the film goes on and we get a great sense of being in another world. This earned its PG-13 rating and would have been rated R if they had just made the scenes bloodier. I think it\'s better than something like Ready Player One because it doesn\'t just rely on pop culture references for jokes. It had a lot more of an original feel to it, which is rare nowadays. Please check out this funny, smart and emotional movie! ***1/2.'"
"Very story driven high octane massive budgeted fun time! Free Guy deserves praise it's so heartwarming delightful video game movie that doesn't fail to keep your attention the whole way through. I saw in RPX quality so worth it for this blockbuster type. Free Guy has so many great parts especially more fun for a gamer for the last couple decades if anyone uses PlayStation add UniqueGranule, important note is I have autism! Anyway about the movie more the comedy is spot on and the effects are good enough to not distract your mind from appreciating everything at least I didn't think so. Probably the best aspect is the empowerment of Guy (Ryan Reynolds) throughout.Sorry for my whacky writing if it helps I have autism."

"It's 1995 Ohio. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and their 'daughters' Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are a Russian sleeper cell working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). 21 years later after the events of Civil War, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run. She goes for a safe house in Budapest where she runs into Yelena (Florence Pugh).The good part of this movie is introducing the 'family' into the Marvel universe. They are a surprisingly fun group. I was not expecting comedy. As for the plot, it's a standard James Bond plot. It's fine. It's able to fill in some of Natasha's history. It crosses a few items off the Marvel checklist. It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether."
"'Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in San Francisco. Katy refers to herself as the Asian Jeff Gordon. After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng\'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death. If you love what Marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after Thanos, then this is must see.'"
"'This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who\'s a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn\'t get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from Iron Man 3, played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It\'s a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there\'s two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It\'s still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary The Problem With Apu even more idiotic. ***1/2.'"
"'A cryptic message from Bond (Daniel Craig)\'s past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organization. While M (Ralph Fiennes) battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind SPECTRE.Each Bond film really needs to be viewed on its own merits, because trying to determine the continuity is confusing. This time within the series\' continuity, the version of Spectre that appeared in Diamonds Are Forever was written out of the timeline with the 2006 reboot of the franchise in Casino Royale, making its appearance in Spectre its first in the new timeline. So just pretend you never heard of Blofeld or Spectre, although you probably have.The continuity is also strange with the change of casting on M and Q, but it is a good change. The younger, fresher Q is a good attempt to move the series into the 21st century. The idea of blood that can be tracked makes sense, but probably would have sounded ludicrous in earlier entries. The action scenes are also much better filmed than Quantum of Solace, making this a strong follow-up.What does the future hold for James Bond? As of now (September 2017), there is no firm date or title as far as I know. Seems like it might be time to bring him back...'"
"'Hey, I\'m sorry but I\'ve watched all James Bond movies since the inception of the character first on screen in 1962 in Dr. No. I have seen all the people who played Bond. Almost all of the time it was either Sean Connery, Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan. They all were suave, cool guys who might have been tough underneath but were classy and right at home in a tuxedo, and had a great sense of humor.This new guy, Daniel Craig, looks like a thug and acts like one. He\'s about as classy as your average rugby player. Give me a break!Even more alarming, the stuff that made the James Bond movies different than the rest of the spy-action movies over the years were (1) the aforementioned classy hero; (2) a lot of fun gadgets, explained by Q; (3) the humor, including all the corny sexual innuendos; (4) a classy boss in \'M\'; here we have Judi Dench as an irritable, foul-mouthed old bag; and (5) the opening credits with the silhouetted naked women. None of that is in here. In other words, this is just another wild, action film with good guys and bad guys. This isn\'t the Bond we have all known for over four decades. Well, I guess all good things come to an end, as they say.'"
"'Since my actual birthday was near, my friend offered to pay for both my admission and concessions when seeing this movie. We both enjoyed Casino Royale, my friend saying it was one of the best. I heartily agree since it was based on the first James Bond novel and as such it stays true to Ian Fleming\'s version of 007. Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there\'s still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch\'s M (God, I miss the Cold War) and Eva Green\'s Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour). And there are the great action set-pieces we\'ve come to love in Bond movies involving construction sites and airports. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. So, yes, I highly recommend Casino Royale.'"
"'Rich man Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) brings back life from a passing comet. These life forms combine with humans and form a dual life. Reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes one of those that combine with an alien. This is a different kind of superhero, more on the order of Deadpool who crosses lines of good and evil. Like most of the Marvel series, the film has great special effects, a long dragged out climax fight that is too long, humor, and a Stan Lee cameo. This one also has 1 F-word.'"
"'Eddie Brock ( Tom Hardy) is a down on his luck and dumped reporter that becomes the host of a faceless, armless, legless extraterrestrial with a bottomless pit of an appetite with extraordinary superpowers. But will all the lethal powers manage to stand protector against other weaponized evil rivals. VENOM is a fantastic mess that will capture you and leave you black and blue.'"
"'This is a fantastic Marvel film! I really like the visuals. The car chase scene is jaw droppingly intense. The way Venom can be good and bad is a really fresh thing to see in a Marvel film. There is comedy and jokes too, and somehow Venom reminds me of Deadpool because of the big white eyes!'"
"Don't get overexcited. Yes I know Daniel Craig has done a couple of other movies. But first of all, the waiting time between two Bond movies was a very long one this time around (around 5 years) and the waiting time for the real Bond was even longer. You could also write a summary line that goes: Will the real Bond please stand up? Apart from current or a bit older catch phrases from music or TV (wrestling), let's get back to what is essential. Just like the movie does. I understand that some people did not like what the movie did. But to celebrate the 50th birthday of Bond there could not have been a better movie (ok there always can be a better movie, but it's a pretty good one right here). I'm not going to reveal any plot points or other significant things that will be more than a treat for Bond lovers. There are so many gems in this one, but without forgetting to make it about a really good story.Daniel Craig must have finally arrived ... at least for most of the fans. Hopefully you can finally enjoy a Bond movie too, even if you didn't until now."
"'Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I think this is one of the best James Bond films ever made. I wasn\'t a fan of Daniel Craig\'s Bond before this.....but I am now. He was outstanding, as was the whole cast. So was the photography (Roger Deakins - one of the best cinematographers in the business) and the action scenes were extremely entertaining. Sure, some - like the opening - were over-the-top but that\'s what we\'ve all come to expect and enjoy with the Bond movies. This opening scene ranks among the most astounding.Javier Bardem (No Country For Old Men) makes a fascinating villain, even though he doesn\'t appear for the first hour of the film.I\'ve watched the movie three times in just over a year - which is unusual for me - and enjoyed it each time.'"
"Word of mouth is not much in favor of this being one of the best Bond pictures. I rather enjoyed the lesser spotlight on gadgets and parade of vixens. Of course I thought the first minute of the movie might be a car ad. The obligatory car chase opens this 007 assignment and it is interesting enough. James Bond(Daniel Graig)is asked to put his emotions on hold; but still manages to pursue the identity of the man responsible for his loved one's betrayal and death as well as foil a sinister business man's control of a nation's major asset...not oil, but water resource.The story more than a bit messy, but enough action to keep most everyone happy. Agent 007 gets knocked around, cut and bruised...but as usual his endurance training serves him well. M(Judi Dench)casts doubt on her prized agent that stays on mission in spite of declassification traipsing to Italy, Austria and South America.Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton serve as Bond eye candy and Mathieu Amalric is the cocky and ruthless villain that you want a piece of if Bond leaves any. Also in the cast: Jeffrey Wright, Jesper Christensen, Joaquin Cosio and Giancarlo Giannini. Fans wait long enough to get their next Bond fix and have a right to be let down...if that's the case, life goes on. However the theme song for QUANTUM OF SOLACE has to rank among the worst ever."
"Estella (Emma Stone) was born with usual black and white hair. Her mother keeps warning her against turning to the evil side known as Cruella. The rebellious young girl lost her mother in a Dalmatian attack. She finds a fashion mentor in The Baroness (Emma Thompson) who turns into her rival and then her oppressor.Disney reworking their villains come with some issues. The obvious one for this character is dogs. It does come up with an interesting solution. Now I don't remember Cruella having dogs herself and that threw me off. Killing off her mother with Dalmatians seems to be overkill. At that point, I was going to murder this movie if it made the Dalmatians into villains and excuses. Quite frankly, non of that is necessary as the solution is very simple and very effective. I would have liked The Baroness to pitch the idea of 101 Dalmatians to Walt Disney but that may be going too far.In the end, this is a very good reworking but it is a lot of road to cover. I was so intrigued with little Estella that she would have been plenty enough for a whole movie herself. It would be an interesting battle between Estella and Cruella. It could have been a Carrie revenge story against her school tormentors. A young Cruella movie may have been a better option."
"To be honest I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie. For some reason I thought it would be a kid movie but the truth is that Cruella is for all ages and very entertaining. The two Emma's (Stone and Thompson) are the major reason for that. They're both skilled actresses and they did a very good job playing their characters. The cinematography is of high quality which was also a thing that made this movie stand out from the rest. And even though the main characters are not very likable persons the story is entertaining from beginning till the end. The dog characters added something cute to the story. Hats off for this movie, much better than I thought it would be."
"'Greetings from Lithuania.Promising Young Woman (2020) is one of the most daring movies i\'ve seen in some time. This movie kept me surprised during its whole 2 hours running time. I was surprised of how moviemaking was good as well as the story overall. Its a movie you won\'t forget soon after it will end. The only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score 10 was maybe the very ending which a bit seemed to movie for me. I really liked it, but it wasn\'t like super realistic - maybe even more felt like fairytale.Overall, Promising Young Woman is a very good movie that sometimes was hard to watch due its premise. The more it revealed the more i felt for our main character. Here is a one movie you won\'t forget soon after seeing it.'"
"'What a gripping story! The ending is triumphant, and the journey to get there is very intense.'"
"'A young woman, Cassie, is on a revenge spree, with her victims being male sexual predators. Once a high-achieving medical student she now works in a coffee shop and lives with her parents. Something happened in her past, something that radically changed her life.An interesting and thought-provoking revenge-drama. Ultimately it doesn\'t really go anywhere new, directionally, in terms of the revenge-drama genre but is quite entertaining and the plot does take a few unexpected twists and turns. In addition, there is a fair amount of intrigue as to what happened in Cassie\'s past to cause her to be like this.Writer-director Emerald Fennell tries to make the plot as balanced as possible as it could easily have degenerated into a polarising all men are bad scenario. However, this exposes some of the flaws in Cassie\'s thinking and actions, leaving you less than 100% engaged with her: while mostly on her side, on occasion she does seem more a villain than a hero. On the plus side, this adds to the edginess and unpredictably of the plot.'"
"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered."
"The Park family is the epitome of riches. The Kim's dwell in a subbasement and live off of assembling pizza boxes. By sheer fate, these two families are brought together. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik) and his sister (Park-So-dam), the Kim children , gets the unexpected opportunity to get work as an English tutor and an art therapist for the Park family children. Unbeknownst to the wealthy family, the Kim's father is hired as chauffeur to the aloof businessman Mr. Park, while Ki-Woo realizes he can, by hook and crook, get his own mother hired to fill a newly opening for housekeeper. The Kim's are providing services while the Parks become the whole bankroll for the parasitic Kim family. The golden opportunity becomes unsteady when underhanded dominance raises its head.Bong Joon-ho's tragicomedy is nearly flawless and deserves its many awards highlighted by the Golden Globes and Oscars. PARASITE makes the Silver Screen a remarkable experience."
"'And a dozen other productions, shamelessly. Just like civilization in 2021 -- total chaos.'"
"Greetings from Lithuania.While with 9 th film in the series they threw all physics and realism out of the window, i would lie if i would say if it wasn't entertaining flick for a boring evening. It was well paced by a veteran of a series Justin Lin - at running time 2 h 20 min i barely was bored. I liked the craftsmanship of this movie - you can clearly see that a lot of money were spent into making this one. The last action sequence alone was made in a daylight - those cost way more so i have to give a credit for it. Sure, the story is your typical stuff about saving the world, i just kinda went with it and had fun.Overall, definitely not a worst in a series (4th i think is still the weakest one), but far from the best (i love 3rd and 5th parts), F9 is big, very dumb but skilfully made movie that is entertaining. Sometimes that is all you want to see."
"The guy who won't shut up about family has a long lost brother he's never mentioned ?Put your brain into fridge and enjoy ;)\nI know they did terrible movie, terrible mistakes, insulting to Physics and etc, but it was kind of fun although :)))5 / 10."
"Terrific gangster movie about true love, sex and drama. I loved it but don't reccomend for everyone. Graphics sex scenes."
365 Days - B- (Fair)A movie based on series of erotic book trilogy stays true to its source material and gives what is required of it. I have to give to actors; they were truly committed to it. They made the movie enjoyable even with its blatant mindless Stockholm syndrome plot. It gives 100% more satisfaction than the 50 Shades trilogy.Anna Maria Sieklucka is stunning; she reminded me a lot of Turkish renowned female actress Beren Saat from Ask-i Memnu (Forbidden Love). It's a good time-pass for people looking for some Netflix and more Chill!!!
"'If you see the very first one or remember it very well, right from the start you will see the connection. Yes the credits indicate we get the true(?) sequel to the original Halloween. And there are so many nice little treats spread throughout the movie (an actress from the first movie reappearing in a different role, but also shots that are almost the same as in the original ... but sometimes there is a twist for the viewers).The original two main actors reprising their roles too (even if some may argue you can\'t tell with Myers because of his mask). This really is a service to fans and a movie that cherishes the original. Of course since the myriads of sequels introduced a lot of stuff, most of which is thrown out the window (no pun intended). One of the primary things being that like in the original, the Killer and the chosen victim are not related. Even so they have a special bond/relationship. So the only movie you need to watch before this, is the Original movie from 1978 - it will be worth your time. The ending of this new one may feel for some like a let down, but it is what it is and even if it feels like a letdown, it still sort of works in the whole picture'"
"'Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ex-TV cowboy with a waning career. His go-fer buddy and stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) has fallen on worse times, but life still goes on in 1969. They live near the Roman Polanski residence with the Manson family lurking in the background. History tells us what happens. The only question is how will Quentin Tarantino present it.I liked how the film captured the stars. You can tell whom they were even without their name being mentioned or they have a credit, such as the woman with the Joey Heatherton hair at the Playboy Mansion. Damon Herriman was not convincing as Charlie.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity'"
"'Quentin Tarantino gives us another tribute to lowbrow entertainment, this time an homage to Hollywood\'s transition to mature material. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood focuses on an actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double (Brad Pitt) in 1969 Los Angeles, a bastion of hippies, old-school agents, and the Mansons...and the protagonist lives next door to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).This brings to mind all the things that happened in summer 1969. The obvious one is the Manson family\'s deeds, but there was also Judy Garland\'s death (and the subsequent Stonewall uprising), the moon landing, and Woodstock. And just as the world was about to move into autumn, Moammar Qaddafi seized power in Libya. What a world it must\'ve been (for the record, I was born long after the \'60s). As Alice\'s Restaurant reminded us, every generation has a story to tell.Anyway, it\'s an impressive movie. I hope that it wins at least one Oscar.'"
"What could of; what should of; not everyone is going to find this Quentin Taranti no flick to their liking...nor to their understanding. But entertaining, you betcha'. Actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) , once a household name TV western star, is having trouble with his life after his six year TV ended. Fame and fortune is waning. His stunt double, Cliff (Brad Pitt), is as every by Rick's side , both trying to reinvent themselves as Hollywood's Golden Age in 1969 Los Angeles is dying. Then all hell breaks loose at neighbor Sharon Tate's (Margo Robbie) house.This comedy, drama gets a little long in the tooth, clocking in at 2 hrs 41 minutes. Also appearing, even for a brief time, are Al Pacino, Bruce Dern, Luke Perry, Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Clu Gulager, Michael Madsen, Rumer Willis and Austin Butler.Exceptional soundtrack features the likes of: Deep Purple, Simon & Garfunkel, Joe Cocker, Bob Seeger, Roy Head and Paul Revere & The Raiders."

"'A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He\'s an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients Lily (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you\'d expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It\'s derivative, certainly - it has shades of The Mummy (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of Dead Man\'s Chest (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd.'"
"'Jungle Cruise is an adaptation of a Disney Park ride that I can barely remember going to and I have been to both Disney parks in the USA.It also has five writers with various screenplay credits.Dwayne Johnson plays Frank. A down on his luck river boat captain who takes tourists for a ride in the Amazon.He is hired by adventurer Lily (Emily Blunt) and her uptight brother MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) who are on the search for the Tears of the Moon. The petals of a tree of life that can cure any illness. The Spanish were in search for it about 400 years earlier.Set in 1916, Lily finds that German Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is also in pursuit at a time when the nations are at war. However Lily finds that Frank is a man who is hard to trust and he is full of cheesy jokes.This comedy adventure is a mish mash of previous movies. I found it more Romancing the Stone mixed with the Brendan Fraser The Mummy movies. There is also a hint of the Pirate of the Caribbean franchise.It harks back to two decades earlier when Disney were adapting their theme park rides rather than superhero movies or remaking their old cartoons as live action films.Jungle Cruise is a colourful romp that lacks originality.'"
"I always make it a rule to only ever do a review once a show or film is ended. In this case, I started about forty minutes in, for one reason only, I was bored to tears.I love the original film, and although a film I thought never needed a follow up, but I was open to it, and thought the basic storyline in this film was pretty good, and imaginative.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, genuinely, the effects, sets and all aspects of the visuals are seriously impressive, that's the major strength, the acting is hard to fault, Gosling is always on point.The downer...... It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears. It never really does though, it improves, but it seems to be on half speed for large spells.I struggled with the plot a bit, possibly because there isn't one.In summary, the window dressing is terrific, it looks sensational, incredibly well acted, the problem, it bored me to tears. 5/10."
"'This film tells the story of a young man who is hungry for success in Wall Street. He becomes a top trader with his remarkable sales and leadership skills. He soon indulges in the world of sex, drugs and luxury that few can dream of.I was hesitant to watch The Wolf of Wall Street at first because of its length. It\'s quite amazing that three hours went by and it did not even feel like three hours. The story is engaging and fuelled with adrenaline. I am very impressed by how well Leonardo DiCaprio\'s character manage to motivate his staff to become successful Wall Street elites. His high energy speeches are quite amazing, and I really feel that energy and passion. The shenanigans that the elites are up to are eye opening and entertaining, as one might have expected better behaviour! An added bonus is that there is much eye candy for everybody (yes, literally everybody). I enjoyed watching The Wolf of Wall Street, as it has got a great plot relevant to the times, and entertaining scenes.'"

"This film tells how the Joker comes to be the villain he is. The problem is that it is so effective and compelling, that I really empathise with the Joker and his horrible life experiences. Batman's father is portrayed as the villain, and the Joker is the victim. It juxtaposes good and bad. How is the next Batman film going to work, when\nBatman's now the son of the bad guy?"
"'This first film in the Harry Potter series spends a lot of time setting up the story for the later instalments while still managing to be entertaining in its own right.The three leads all look very meek, mild and very young but still give good performances alongside their established nearly all British elders. The plot moves along at a quick pace and the former Home Alone director Collumbus is able to combine the magic and humour from the original novel with all the darkness and visual aids that only cinema could offer. Although the warmth can be a little cloying at times the balance is by and large good.Overall a solid first instalment to the series and a must for anyone discovering Potter for the first time.'"

"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, based on the novel it seems every kid has read (to my surprise considering that I hated reading most books as a kid, especially ones that looked longer than 200 pages and had little or no pictures but then I'm not a kid anymore) is now a movie and while it is certainly overrated and sometimes stupid, it gives some decent moments of entertainment.  It is another film that will depend on the viewer on how much he/she can take with near non-stop adventure and (impressive) visual effects.  It's a wonder the film made 93 million in one weekend (isn't that a sign of biblical armageddon though), but since the film is directed a lot more at kids it's not a total surprise since the movie gets a big reccomendation in the family film department.  But teens and adults might not want to walk in the theater prepared to see the greatest film since Wizard of Oz like the kids are.  A little long but never really boring, Harrpy Potter offers up a nice stew of excitement on this thanksgiving weekend with some great visuals and score (from John Williams).  Yet it is not a great film.  Grade: between A- and B+"
"If you don't know your Potter (like me), than you might have a problem with the titles. With other series, it's easier to distinguish, which one is part 1, 2, 3 etc. etc. Even the Naked Gun series which has Parts 2 and half and 33 and a third, you still know the order (not of the Phoenix obviously!) ;o) But enough about my (let's call it) ignorance, for the books (haven't read them guilty as charged) and off to the movie itself. Which is obviously targeted at a young audience. And it delivers on this premise. Plus it has to introduce characters to the world (for those who know them and those who don't). A good job overall, but nothing great in my eyes ..."
"Based on the wonderful novel, this film brilliantly tells the story of the unknown Zodiac killer, who operated in the late 60's and early 70's.You will easily lose a full night or afternoon with this movie, it's incredibly, it's engaging, dramatic, and captivating. I love how the time passes by on the film, everything changes accordingly, it's very well produced. At times it's very sinister, and creepy, but it's subtle, nothing is forced or heavy handed.The acting is terrific, Ruffalo and Downey are brilliant, a fresh faced Jake Gyllenhaal is arguably the one that steals the show.It really is a brilliant movie, I would recommend it highly. 9/10."
"'This is a film about the infamous Zodiac killer. It starts in 1969 and spans over 2 1/2 hours to 1991, The film centers on Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who is obsessed with solving the crime which involves a fellow reporter and numerous police officials. He accuses a number of suspects, each of which lacks for a hand writing or fingerprint match.The film shows a few murders, but is hardly gruesome. The exciting scenes consisted of opening letters from the zodiac and Jake scratching his head. It was a rather boring police drama.There is a cutout of Dirty Harry in one of the scenes, a man who got his zodiac style killer.Interesting as a history, but not as a crime drama.Parental Guide: no f-bombs, sex, or nudity.'"

"Dani (Florence Pugh) and her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) join a few of his buddies on a trip to a small remote Swedish village for its midsummer festival. Dani needs a distraction from her parent's deaths. This little trip is surreal and a profound distraction. This movie is a different type of scary. And involves a different kind of fear. A bit slow, like having one hand tied...but you are afraid to untie yourself.There is some full nudity and traumatic imagery. For sure worth your investment."
"'Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites a group of college kids to go to his small commune in Sweden to witness the Midsummer festivals at a time when the sun doesn\'t really set. The film centers on Dani (Florence Pugh) whose bipolar sister killed herself and her parents.Things went pretty much as expected as we get the Wicker Man and Harvest Home combination. The movie is about average.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.'"
"Be first thing I wanted to do after leaving the cinema, was to discover what the swedish thought of this film, in general they saw it with humour, and an open mind, as I expected.It's pretty much split right down the middle, first half, dare I say it, normality, drama, with a heavy focus on grief, and the harsh way it can affect someone, particularly if there's trauma involved. The second half is very trippy, and we delve into the world of pagan ritual and bizarre rights, which makes The Whicker Man look like a tea party.The main leads, Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor, were terrific. Pugh had impressed previously in The Little Drummer Girl, it was obvious she was destined for big things, she played Dani with a real sense of torment, very impressive. The cast had a realism, it was refreshing not to watch a cast that look set for a Dior catwalk.It won't be for everyone, and I must point out that some scenes are painfully long, needlessly. Some amazing special effects.Violence and nudity, but neither are gratuitous or simply for shock. A few laughs, several times the cinema erupted in laughter.Very good. 8/10"

"'Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.'"
"Though both don't give here an usual performance, if you compare with what they did before. Nothing at all. This looks more like a Walter Hill's film than a Ritchie's one. In the style, it is far far closer to EXTREME PREJUDICE than to SNATCH, in terms of narrative grammar. Definitely. At first, I was sooo scared when they talked about a remake of Nicolas Boukrief's LE CONVOYEUR, so scared...Of course it is different, but maybe even better, and I would have never bet a dime on it. So, what a surprise, in this topic, very unusual, where you deal with several groups, several points of views, where Statham, for once since CRAZY JOE, doesn't play Statham, where you have no good vs evil men, everyone is more or less rotten, and no romance either. Yes, it is a damn good remake, I am nearly ashamed to have been angry about this remake before seeing it; but LE CONVOYEUR is an iconic movie for me. The military robbers group is very well shown, with their families, birthday party, with wives and kids, so we feel empathy for themn though they are the Statham's enemies. That's precisely what I love. Yes, yes yes, tha's the first Guy Ritchie film that I love, and unfortunately maybe the last. A terrific crime flick. A lost gem from Australia and made in 1979, MONEY MOVERS, offers also a very close topic, with also a bloody climax taking place in a security complex facility."
"It's high school senior year for Bianca (Mae Whitman), and her best friends hot sweet Jess (Skyler Samuels) and hot Latina Casey (Bianca A. Santos). Wesley (Robbie Amell) is her childhood friend, neighbor and man-whore jock. At a party, he tells her that she's Jess and Casey's DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). This throws her into a tailspin. Madison (Bella Thorne) is the class mean girl. Bianca has a crush on Toby but she has trouble talking to him.This conventional teen comedy has a couple of things going for it. Whitman is adorable and believable at being overlooked. Amell plays the jock without being mean-spirited. The 'kids' are mostly in their 20s. With likable Whitman and Amell, the movie is able to maneuver the standard plot without crashing. That's not to say there aren't a couple of awkward moments. Bianca's fantasy scenes do get repetitive and one of them last too long. It's a gimmick that loses its effectiveness. The movie doesn't work all the time but it works enough. It's not quite 'Mean Girls'. The writing isn't as sharp. It probably needs a great comedic writer to add more of the better material."
"'. . . CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN and MATERIAL GIRLS, but none of these flicks explained why this actress chose to go by that name. After seeing THE D.U.F.F., Hilary\'s career suddenly all makes sense. She epitomized Duffness before anyone tried to make it cool. THE D.U.F.F. certainly is carefully crafted to make viewers ask themselves, What other Hollywood stars are going about their business as acronyms-waiting-to-happen? Has Hilary S. given tips to Bella Thorne (who plays the B*Tchy Madison Morgan in THE D.U.F.F.) about how Some Women Are Not Kissable (S.W.A.N.K.)? Which Wayans relative does Kevin H. think most deserves notoriety for possessing Hardly Any Real Talent (H.A.R.T.)? On the morbid side, did Paul Walker have a subconscious tendency to take after James D. as a Dead End Auto Nut (D.E.A.N.)? As you can see, THE D.U.F.F. has started a new form of word play that is as likely to sweep the country as Six Degrees of Kevin Bad Actors Can Only Network (B.A.C.O.N.) did in the previous century.'"
"'Many reviewers say you have to watch this movie multiple times to really get it all. No, I won\'t do that. I say a good movie is understandable with one viewing where the viewer is paying attention.This is a relatively simple story, told in a complex manner with lots of special effects and aggressive sound track. Our future civilization has figured a way to interact with the past and now, in our PRESENT they intend to correct a problem we caused them, and if necessary destroy the world as we know it. So the PRESENT day leaders have to prevent that.My wife and I watched it on a 2-disc DVD set from our public library. Much of the dialog is difficult to understand because the actors often fail to enunciate, so I had to turn on subtitles about half-way through. The second DVD is filled with extras.It is a pretty good, entertaining movie, but often very confusing. I would not put it in the top tier of favorite movies. Nolan\'s Inception for example is a much better movie.'"
"The film opens with music critics gone bad.May contain plot spoilers as I understand the plot. John David Washington is recruited to save the world from Andrei (Kenneth Branagh ) a Russian oligarch. A secret city in Russia was destroyed and has bomb grade 241 laying about in standardized containers. However, the plot isn't that simple. There is a time travel thing going on. Things move backwards and forwards in time. Both have to happen as not to disturb the entropy. If the algorithm is altered, everything ends. The guy who wants to start WWIII in involved with the time travel.Things were confusing to say the least with too much of the film running backwards to prevent a paradox. Needed to be shorter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"Train To Busan can be summed up in four words: zombies on a train. But what director Sang-ho Yeon does with this simple premise is extremely impressive, giving the somewhat tired zombie genre another jolt of life.Using his confined locationâa packed intercity trainâto maximum effect, Yeon expertly ramps up the tension, the living gradually whittled down to a handful of passengers fighting for survival against the slavering undead (a bit like taking the last train home from Waterloo on a Saturday night).There are some great ideas present that really add to the excitement, such as the zombies getting confused whenever the train enters a tunnel and swarming in numbers to break through barriers (with special effects easily on a par with those in World War Z). Surprisingly, the gore quotient is very low, but with such a rollicking pace, the lack of blood really isn't an issue.Perhaps a touch too long at almost two hours to be perfect, Train to Busan is nevertheless one of the better zombie films to come out in recent years. Highly recommended. 8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"'Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies.'"
"I haven't seen many Zombie movies, but Zombieland (Woody Harrelson) is one that ranks highly. So does Last Train To Busan, a frenetic and emotionally moving addition to the genre. The ending was very emotional, and you never really knew for sure which characters would survive the last stand. The special effects was incredibly impressive, and the acting top form."
'Relentlessly tense and intense zombie movie that is really quite exhausting to watch. If only it was 15 minutes shorter it would be a 10 star movie.'
"'Rocketman tells the story of Elton John - it\'s not an actual biography, though. It\'s told in the fantasy setting of a music, using many of his fabulous songs.The timing of events is often inaccurate, songs are used at times before they were written. the story has inaccuracies, but who cares - it\'s not meant to be accurate, it\'s meant to be fun. And it is.Elton tells his story while in rehab, about his cold father, his relationship with his mom and nana, his beginnings playing piano and composing, meeting Bernie Taupin, stardom, lovers, and addictions. One thing not emphasized - Elton supposedly had a warm relationship with his mom\'s second husband, Fred, whom he called Derf - but you really don\'t get that impression in the film.Taron Edgerton sings like a dream and makes a terrific Elton. What can I say about the music? I loved every note.Elton John is a brilliant musician. a flamboyant performer, a humanitarian, and an interesting personality. Even if you don\'t get his entire story from Rocketman, you certainly realize that.'"
"This is the story of a Japan so out of control that in order to regain control (I think) they stage a survival game that makes TV's Survivor look like a walk in the park. One class of kids is dumped on an island and told that the last one alive wins. This is a very very funny movie in a black comedy sort of way. Its very violent and bloody and makes you wonder about why you're laughing since its not all that far off from the way society operates, especially Japanese society, where kids regularly kill themselves for not getting into the right school.Its not for all tastes. Some people will find the idea offensive, a fact that has kept the film from having an official US release. If you can take your comedy black as night, then see this movie.8 out of 10"

"'The family man Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is a forty-three year-old architect married with children with the artist Karen Alvarado (Ignacia Allamand). When Karen travels with their children to a house by the beach, Evan stays at home since he is very busy in his work. During the stormy night, two young women knock on his door asking for help since they are lost.

On the next morning, Evan finds the girls in the kitchen and realizes that they are deranged punks and they want to punish him for cheating his wife. Knock Knock is a film with a moralist and feminist violent story. The plot recalls Michael Haneke\'s Funny Games (1997), with the girls trashing Evan\'s house and torturing him. The story forgets Louis and the conclusion is funny when the boy says that daddy gave a party when he sees the house totally destroyed.

"'I had the pleasure to watch this movie in an IMAX theatre in London (it advertises itself, with the slogan Biggest screen in the UK), which was one of the greatest movie experiences I had in my life. And it was my first movie in an IMAX theatre. I can only recommend it for anyone who has the chance to watch it, even if not the entire movie is shot for an IMAX theatre, this still is able to blow someone away! Great visuals combined with a great story and superb acting.The movie could also have been called The Joker, but even with Heath Ledgers great performance, this still is a Batman movie. And The Dark Knight is clear enough, even without the Batman in the title. I simply loved the movie, but I heard some complaints from some friends. It seems that some might have a problem with the depiction of the characters (I loved Heath Ledger, but there are a few out there who would have wanted to see him even crazier) or the plot threads (especially what is done with the character of Aaron Eckhart). Although I can see why that might be a problem for fans of the comic books, I still stand by my vote. This is the best Batman movie ever (until hopefully Nolan and Bale make the next one)!'"
"'After Batman Begins. Director Christopher Nolan went into a brooding nihilistic territory with The Dark Knight.It introduces The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopath laced with cynicism and determined to create chaos. It starts off with a punchy bank heist which The Joker uses to creatively eliminate his cohorts.In Gotham City, Batman (Christian Bale) is happy to see the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to take on the villains. Dent is also seeing a lot of Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal.)However The Joker creates an alliance with the ring leaders of organised crime in the city and then takes the fight to Batman. Meanwhile Dent realises the extent of corruption in the local police with James Gordon (Gary Oldman) the only honest cop about.Nolan a fan of James Bond films has created several terrific action scenes. One set in Hong Kong is a more over the top homage to a Sean Connery circa Bond film.Nolan also deftly introduces a second villain in the form of Two Face. Much better here than Tommy Lee Jones unconvincingly camping it up with weak material In Batman Forever.Ultimately Nolan puts humanity to test here as The Joker places two bombs in two ships. One full of civilians and another full of prisoners being evacuated. The Joker wants destruction and turmoil. He simply wants to watch the world burn.The Dark Knight is also bloated and at times cumbersome with its long running time.'"
"'Unbelievably enough, then it is only now in 2013 that I got around to actually watching The Dark Knight. Why? Well because I am not much fan of superhero movies or comic book heroes who ventured to the big screen. However, having seen all the older Batman movies, I will say that with The Dark Knight, then Christopher Nolan have really put the previous Batman movies to shame.And with good reason.The storyline in The Dark Knight is for a more mature audience, and it appeals to an audience capable of coherent thought, unlike the pseudo-comical older Batman movies.And with an impressive list of talent on the cast list, then The Dark Knight really does impress. However, I remember the hype about Heath Ledger\'s death and his performance of the Joker in this movie. With the risk of offending a great number of people here, then I don\'t really get that hype. His performance was good, sure, but it was a bit hyped up by the media. Jack Nicholson did a good enough job with his interpretation of the Joker back in the day, but he didn\'t get this much hype.Moving on, The Dark Knight offers a good storyline, spiced up with nifty action sequences, and of course a lot of bat utilities - as always.The Dark Knight was a major step upwards from Batman Begins, and I must admit that this movie have sparked an interest in actually sitting down to watch The Dark Knight Rises as well.'"
"More of the same, maybe a little more creative. This sequel starts with the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski), who happens to be the movie's director. The creatures waste no time with their hunting by sound. Emily Blunt is very good as she now takes solo leadership of her family. And Millicent Simmonds is even more outstanding as the clever daughter. An old family friend (Cillian Murphy) has mixed feelings on offering the Abbotts spare supplies or shelter.Tension filled situations with erie cinematography Dreadful and suspenseful saga of survival. Also in the cast: Okieriete Onaodwan, Djimon Hounsou and Noah Jupe."
"The movie starts with the arrival of the monsters. Then it proceeds to immediately after the first movie and the death of Lee Abbott (John Krasinski). Evelyn Abbott (Emily Blunt) and her three children seek a new refuge. They stumble upon old friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy) but he doesn't believe that he has enough supplies for everyone. He wants them out.This is a good sequel and builds upon the first movie. It's filling in both sides of the story and the franchise could continue with more production. The girl continues to be a standout among some great veteran adult actors. I would double-down more with the silence concept. I would strip the foley work to a bare minimum and some of the movie background music. Let the silence haunt this movie. Let's go all natural. That would be my biggest change. The other change is when they find the new sanctuary. They need to locate the target right away. They wouldn't take too long of a break. I would have them wake up from exhaustion and rush around trying to find the target. They could stumble upon the boat while on the search and the movie would end the same way. All in all, this is a very solid sequel to a compelling and unique franchise. I would just steer into the uniqueness of the franchise and go even more quiet."
"It's 1984 and Diana Prince is working at the Smithsonian in Washington. A new shipment of artefacts has come in, one of which is a seemingly innocuous, not-very-valuable stone. However, failed businessman Max Lord recognises the stone as the Dream Stone, a stone that grants wishes, and quickly steals it and starts abusing its powers. This puts the world in jeopardy.I'm not a fan of super-hero / comic book movies but didn't mind the first Wonder Woman movie so much. It wasn't brilliant but did have more of a plot than most films in the genre and initially limited the fantasy / sci fi nonsense. The film did revert to type towards the end, with a lame plot and superficial CGI-driven action scenes but for the most part it was entertaining.Wonder Woman 1984 follows roughly the same path: decent plot and set-up in the beginning but then unravels and becomes quite superficial and clichÃ©d towards the end. Gal Gadot's performance in the first film wasn't a problem but here it does set the film back slightly. Maybe there's more dialogue in this one, that's why.Overall: not great, not terrible, entertaining enough."
"Gal Gadot returns perhaps the longest legs on the screen back into view. Why do they look sexy in the slit dress and like a tomboy in her costume? Chris Pine, her dead boyfriend also returns as I guess the Star Trek residuals are fading out. We are introduced to the invisible aircraft. A wish crystal is discovered and falls into the wrong hands. I liked the character played by Kristen Wiig. The opening of Diana as a child was great, but didn't tie into the overall film that well, and yes it is supposed to. The script was generic fluff and I still don't know what she did during WWII. Nice end cameo by Linda Carter. Does that means she is going to be in future films? The end speech by Diana was such a bore, I was wishing for the world to end."
"There's a lot of gunshots, fights and blood. There so much violence that it becomes over the top funny. The last scene literally becomes Home Alone, watch it and you'll know what I mean."
'Awesome action movie! Great comedic moments and vivid cinematography. The acting was decent and the storyline was well developed. The final battle scene was epic. Top notes all around.'
"Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is a mild mannered auditor who works for his father-in-law. He allows a couple of crooks to get away with his watch and the contents of the kitchen table bowl. He is belittled for it. When his daughter mentions her kitty cat bracelet was in the bowl, he goes full John Wick vigilante to find it. He ends up crossing paths with the Russian mafia run by a connected and backed sociopath.While considered an action film, you can't help but laugh at many of the scenes. As well as integrated humor they managed a great classic soundtrack to make you smile. My favorite scene was when the Russian computer girl gets Hutch Mansell's file.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"'In order to control future rebellions remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four player must kill each other and survive in the wilderness and only one wins. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population.In the District 12, the teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a great hunter and eximious archer. When her younger sister Primrose Everdeen is selected as one of the representative of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they head by train to the Capital to be trained to the brutal game. Who will win The Hunger Games?The Hunger Games is an entertaining rip-off Battle Royale mixed with any film about totalitarian society, such as Logan\'s Run, 1984 or Brave New World.I was curious to see this film due to the hype surrounding it, but the plot is not original and I have seen this type of story before. It is quite impossible to recognize Elizabeth Banks travestied in her androgynous character. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Jogos Vorazes (Voracious Games)'"
"'I have to confess that I\'ve never heard of the book The Hunger Games or that novel\'s author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn\'t been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public\'s attention, I probably wouldn\'t have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can\'t wait for the sequels when they come!'"
"Jennifer's Body is directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody. It stars Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, J.K. Simmons, Andy Sedaris and Adam Brody. Music is by Stephen Barton and Thodore Shapiro and cinematography by M. David Mullen. Plot finds Fox as a High School cheerleader who gets possessed by a demon and starts eating the boys from school. Seyfried is the homely best friend who tries to stop her.Women impacting on the horror genre from the directing or writing chairs is in short supply, sadly the team-up of Diablo Cody and Karyn Kusama has barely made a stain on this issue. The intentions, you feel, were honourable from the outset, an attempt to blend hip pop culture comedy with demonic horror, wrapped around the perils of High School sexual learnings, unfortunately the final product is decidedly tepid. Neither funny, bloody or scary, and with weak CGI into the bargain, film feels confused in trying to cover so many bases. The High School setting is lazy, Kusama isn't able to build suspense and Cody's writing misses the required emotional beats. Cast are fine, the odd gag scores some giggles and the film is often sexy, while the score literally does rock, but all told it's just too messy, too studio safe for its own good. 5/10"
"Thank you Michael Dougherty for writing and directing this treat that mixes a bit of suspense with gory goodness. A blend of several little Halloween stories that don't disappoint one bit. Anna Paquin plays a young college virgin that goes off to a party as Little Red Riding Hood looking for just the right guy. He finds her. Kind of comical and evil is Dylan Baker as a school principal with a serial killer attitude. I love the scene where he takes his obnoxious son into the basement. A couple returns home and the woman(Leslie Bibb) wants to blow out a jack-o'-lantern and take down the decorations in the front yard earlier than her husband would like. And a group of trick or treaters get more than they want when investigating an old Halloween tale of a school bus and rock quarry. Brian Cox is an old hermit that is visited by a very malice trick-or-treater with a few bones to pick.Some very nice graphics and situations. You don't have to watch too close to see how the stories are interwoven. Not overly slice and dice, but just enough believable fright to share. Also in the cast: Samm Todd, Alberto Ghisi, Lauren Lee Smith and Rochelle Aytes."
"A fine cast is the inspiration for this 2013 engrossing film where 2 little friends are kidnapped and the extremely distraught father of one of them, Hugh Jackman in a fine performance, tragically goes way beyond what someone should do in this situation with much tragedy resulting.Maria Bello is his distraught wife and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis add to the drama as the other parents. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-nosed detective who is always able to crack cases but is bewildered by this one.Melissa Leo has some scene stealing scenes as the aunt of the accused.The film shows Jackman's deterioration into lunacy as he kidnaps the man he feels responsible for what has occurred. Howard and Davis are reluctant participants and the ending is eerie but purely Alfred Hitchcock-like."
"Opening with a funeral for the secretive, distant matriarch of the family, the tension grows almost immediately. What at first appears to be family dysfunction, reveals itself to be something else. Something dark and deeply disturbing. HEREDITARY is more than just an ordinary horror film, in the same way that THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING are more than the sum of their parts.Make no mistake, this is one scary movie. It's also mysterious and shocking, building a palpable sense of creeping, conspiratorial doom.Toni Collette is tremendous in her role as the possibly unstable, paranoid Annie. Is she losing her mind, or is something infinitely worse going on? Gabriel Byrne is her husband Steve, watching as his family disintegrates before his eyes. Alex Wolff is the teenage son, Peter, and Milly Shapiro is young Charlie. Every character is necessary, and nothing is as it seems.This movie bears several viewings. Very few horror films have the ability to drill into the mind and stay there. This one hits that spot..."
"'Generally Regarded as one of the Better Horror Movies of Recent Years.It\'s one that Slow-Burns and Creeps Under Your Skin and into Your Head.Debut Movie for Writer/Director Ari Aster (followed by Midsommar (2020).The Film is Highlighted by some Incredible Camera Work and a Bravura Performance from Toni Collette.The Other Actors Deliver Riveting Roles that are Demanding and Essential to the Power of this Haunting and Harrowing Movie.Not Without some Issues, like the Over Two Hour Running Time that is Pushing the Limits of such a Nerve-Racking Template to the Extreme.The Ending can Alienate some Viewers with a Cultish Trope that can be Over-the-Top or Downright Bizarre.There is No Doubt that this is a most Unsettling Film.It is Not an Easy Watch, it\'s Presented with Painstaking Images with a Rhythm and Style at a Pondering Pace .Viewers with Patience will be Rewarded while others may Head for the Exits.Not for Everyone .If Cerebral Horror with a Slow-Burn is what You Seek, Look No Further.This is a Well Crafted Exploration of Generational Dysfunction with an Infection of Supernatural Evil.'"
"What a brilliant story! It is a horror film that keeps a high level of tension, suspense and mystery. It really keeps me having palpitations for minutes so the end of the film. It stands out from the rest of the horror films because it doesn't follow the formula, doesn't require loud noises and doesn't require sudden movements to make you feel scared."
'Ari Aster considers his Hereditary more of a family drama than a horror movie. I can see that. It does focus more on grief than on jump scares. It\'s no comparison to The Shining in creating terror (but what movie is?).There were certainly a few scenes that shocked me. The downsides are the uneven performances and a few things that look kind of silly. But that dollhouse and a couple of tricks that rival Hitchcock in using non-verbal ways to tell the story make for one fine movie. I hope that Aster makes more movies like this.'
"I am glad to see that this was actually a Hollywood re-make that improved on something already established, as re-makes tend to be tedious and unnecessary money machines.However, this 2017 remake really upped the game a lot in terms of horror, violence, blood and pure weirdness. They definitely went for a more evil and sinister feel to the movie, and Pennywise shed his family-friendly skin (that he wore in the 1990's version) and draped a cape voven of pure dread.The storyline is much familiar, if you have seen the 1990 edition, but there is so much more added to this 2017 version. It does the novel much more justice.The CGI and special effects are good, and do add a lot of spice to the movie.Pennywise was adequate, although it was a bit difficult taking him serious with those buck teeth and the way he kept pouncing towards the children. The scene where Pennywise was dancing below in the caves was also a bit too comical for my liking.The children were really doing amazing jobs with their characters and roles in this 2017 version.It was definitely worth the wait and the hype. And for once, a Hollywood re-make that didn't turn out to be a questionable re-make spawned only by utter greed, pointlessness and a lack of creative thought."
Wow. This story is expertly crafted that I just don't know what is real and what isn't. Amazing acting too.
"'It\'s been quite a while since I felt the Oscar winner for best actor actually turned in the best effort... Well, there is absolutely no doubt here that Sir Anthony Hopkins is on fine form as the elderly gent who is struggling to keep a grip on reality as he suffers from dementia. Coupled with a sparing contribution from Dame Olivia Colman who plays his daughter Anne and who is also excellent as the woman trying to juggle her own life with the responsibilities of caring for her father - sometimes lucid, sometimes less so... The performance from Hopkins allows him to build on his substantial stage experience to present us with a deeply thought out portrayal of a man dealing with psychological issues he (and sometimes the audience, too) is largely unaware he has, and he excels. Regrettably, the supporting cast let the film down rather - Mark Gatiss and Rufus Sewell could have done so much more as actors and with their characters - though, to be fair, their appearances seem to serve as little more than a bit of light relief for the audience from the intensity of Sir Anthony\'s contribution. The extent to which Florian Zeller has referred to any established clinical templates or practices when directing his own play for the big screen doesn\'t matter - this reeks of authenticity and engenders frustration, empathy and sympathy like no film that I have seen for many a year. A must watch, I\'d say...'"

"I am going to start with the strengths of this Bond entry. It is for me one of the better-looking Bonds, both the cinematography and locations are truly inspired, and I loved the Icelandic snow palace. The pacing is relentless and the direction is done with fluid style, while the incidental music is good enough. The script has some nice moments too apart from some cringe-worthy one liners, while the action is very intense. In terms of acting, Pierce Brosnan is on fine form as the betrayed and vengeful secret agent. Bond is still charming and witty in some ways, but also tough and angry, Brosnan portrays this excellently. Halle Berry is a nice addition, and Judi Dench and John Cleese are solid too as is Toby Stephens as villainous Graves and especially beautiful Rosamund Pike as chillingly frosty Miranda Frost. However, the plot is quite familiar and quite preposterous in a sense in the second half, and there is an overload of CGI and sadly it's awful. My two main problems though are both to do with Madonna. One is that her theme song is truly grating and one of the more forgettable theme songs. The other is that her cameo as a fencing instructor is truly dire. In conclusion, a mostly solid if slightly disappointing entry in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"This is Pierce Brosnan's fourth stint as James Bond and probably the best Bond flick in long time. This loud, action-packed adventure has 007 taking on an enigmatic agent (Halle Berry)to help take on a madman with a satellite-laser weapon. An ego troubled diamond broker; a power hungered North Korean terrorist; an ice fortress and a world as we know it to protect...gorgeous girls, fascinating gadgets and beautiful locations equal a top shelf Bond movie. Also in the cast are: Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Michael Madsen and a cameo by Madonna who also sings the theme song. Maybe a little long, but this is fun and James Bond."
"'This Stephen King film adaptation will please as many fans as it confuses. No it is not another trip to the Overlook to revisit events of years ago; But Dan Torrance (Ewan McGregor) is now an adult still scarred by the trauma he endured from watching his father lose his mind at that closed winter resort. His own peace of mind is re-shattered when he meets a teenage girl, Abra (Kyliegh Curran). who has he own extrasensory gift, that is known as the \'shine. She has sought out Dan for protection from a cult called The True Knot that seeks her out to \'feed\' off of her \'shine\'. Good versus evil and a quest for immortality.Violent, graphic and disturbing visions of death. Also featured in the cast: Rebecca Ferguson, Emily Alyn Lind, Cliff Curtis, Carel Struycken and Zahn McLarnon.'"
"'I watched this twice, 3 weeks apart, at home on DVD from my public library. Unfortunately there are no extras regarding making of the movie.Ewan McGregor is the grown up little Dan Torrance from The Shining. He has had a difficult life including turning to alcohol in struggling with his innate ability to shine. Unlike the first movie, which was almost entirely in the lodge in the winter, this one is set at various locations across the USA, but getting back to the lodge near the end is necessary to wrap up the story.Although this is not my favorite genre, and I\'m not a big fan of The Shining, I really like this movie. It has lots of complexity and interesting characters. Even though it runs a bit over 2 hours it never seemed long.Good movie and Rebecca Ferguson is also very good as Rose The Hat who with her band of shiners capture children who shine and absorb their steam so that they may live almost forever. But Dan and Abra have something to say about that.'"
'Great follow up from the shinning. I like when they recreate the heeeeers Johnny scene.'
"'Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg, The Departed is a compellingly dramatic story of moles in both the police and organized crime gangs in Boston. Nicholson is at his most charismatic over-the-top as mob boss Frank Costello, Damon is fine as Costello\'s informant at police headquarters, DiCaprio is excellent as the undercover cop trying to bring Costello down. Scorsese seems to show off his actors in the beginning but brings us full force by the time we find who Damon\'s father is on the phone. Also compelling is newcomer Vera Farmiga as Damon\'s girlfriend and DiCaprio\'s shrink and lover. Watch also for Anthony Anderson and from 24, James Badge Dale. Well worth seeing for Scorsese enthusiasts.'"
"Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston Irish mobster. He mentors Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) ever since as a little kid. Eventually Colin joins the Special Investigation Unit in the State Police headed by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the unpleasant Staff Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg). He works directly under Captain Ellerby (Alec Baldwin). He begins a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a new police recruit from a family of lowlife criminals. Queenan and Dignam put him undercover. After serving some time in prison, he works with his petty criminal cousin Sean (Kevin Corrigan) and catches the eye of Sullivan's henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone).Director Martin Scorsese goes to Boston to film this gangster opera. The cast is second to none. There is great acting being done here. Leo is terrific holding up even against the peacock acting of Nicholson. Winstone is powerfully rough. Damon is twisting his sweet persona into something a bit more of a douche. There is a bit too much plot and sometimes, the movie tries to do too many things. For example, Scorsese doesn't need some of the camera moves or the back and forth editing which only distracts from staying with the plot. It may work even better with a simplified style. This movie is best at its bloody brutal core especially with Leo acting up a storm."
"'Martin Scorsese, the master of gang epics, is at it again. This time in The Departed, he uses modern technology to show what mobsters et al can do to create mayhem.The acting here is first rate as Jack Nicholson, who portrays a vicious criminal, is right on target. His antics are terrific. Leonardo De Caprio delivers a knockout performance as the guy working secretly for the police. Matt Damon does a fine job as the guy going in the opposite direction.The film deals with 2 young men recruited to serve in various capacities. One works for the mob to infiltrate the state police department in Boston, the other is a cop working for the mob boss. You would think that their lives would connect sooner as both see and fall for a female doctor.The violence and use of the 4 letter word is really too much to bear. Look for nice supporting performances from Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg as veteran cops.The film goes downhill in quality as the body count begins to mount. This film is certainly not for the squeamish.'"
"'I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie.Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a normal person.This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. Tobey Maguire plays a likable Peter Potter (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend Mary Jane Watson. It was kind of interesting to see \'60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter\'s Uncle Ben. This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place.'"
"'Parody of the Scream series and the I Know What You Did... series. A bunch of teens accidentally kill a man one night and dump the body and agree to never tell anyone. A year later they get notes telling them that someone knows what they did last summer. This is all a copy of the first I Know What You Did Last Summer and throws in some very funny parodies of sequences from the movie pointing out all the stupidity and inconsistent plot lines. However there\'s also a killer wandering around dressed just like the killer from the Scream movies and we get parodies from those movies too.The jokes are sometimes VERY crude and not all of them work but, as a horror fan, I found this movie hilarious. I got every reference and plot point they were making fun of it and the movie keeps moving full tilt throwing out jokes left and right. The plot doesn\'t make a lot of sense but neither did the original movies. The cast are as good as they can be saying their lines with completely straight faces and enjoying themselves. There\'s also quite a bit of nudity in here--all male! Well worth seeing--especially for horror fans.'"
"Mortal Kombat has been rebooted as a gore laden and a more serious action packed movie.It is surprisingly entertaining but a predictable film. The director makes effective use of some visceral battle fights.It starts off in 17th Century Japan. Bi-Han/Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim) kills the ninja clan led by Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion. He kills Hanzo as well as his wife and son.Raiden, god of thunder, arrives and takes Hanzo's infant daughter to safety.In the present day. Outworld has defeated Earthrealm in nine of ten tournaments known as Mortal Kombat. If Earthrealm loses the tenth tournament, it can be conquered by Outworld.An ancient prophecy that the blood of Hanzo Hasashi will bring a new generation of Earthrealm's champions. One such person is a former MMA fighter named Cole Young (Lewis Tan.)The movie needed a bit more humour. I thought Kano (Josh Lawson) who provided some of the banter quickly became tiring.The big problem was the lack of a well known star so this really is a B movie fodder. However for a movie based on a computer game franchise, it is still one of the better ones."
"'For this kind of film, if done right, 12 seconds of backstory, prologue and character development are more than enough. This was done right.'"
"'Greetings from Lithuania.Mortal Kombat (2021) was a bit of surprising fun. I expected it to bad, but it turned out to be fun flick, and definitely not a bad one. It has cool fights, cool kills and fun writing. I liked characters but that is because i played these games a lot back in the day. If you are not familiar with lore, you won\'t get much excitement from it I\'m sure.Overall, i liked this flick. The decision to make it R rated movie was a very good decisions. I kinda wish they brought guys who made Raid movies fights for a next film - i hope you know what i mean. Also outcome in this movie for what it was came way to quick. Acting was pretty descent for this material. All in all this is fun flick especially if you like the source material.'"
"'Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien\'s Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I\'m not going to summarize the story--there\'s way to much going on.  All I\'ll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that\'s to get in the plot) and there\'s a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I\'ve ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there\'s so much plot and action going on that you\'re exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it\'s the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!'"
"'In my opinion this is the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made. The journey of Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring is outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. My vote is ten.'"

"'A pop culture phenomenon, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is unlike anything that you\'ve ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn\'t any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien\'s novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I\'ve never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history\'s most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word.'"
"This is actually one of the best teen movies in the past few decades that I can think of.First of all, the screenplay is great. Tina Fey did a great job, she is definitely a great comedian. Besides her we also have many other actors from SNL so it is not surprising that it is so good.The storyline is pretty clever. Of course since it is not documentary but comedy it does exaggerate what high school is like but one still can connect to the issues it presents. And it is full of quotes that are just classic now.The characters are all well done to represent different kind of students and parents. And the main characters have a deeper personality, one starts to understand them and their actions the more one gets to know them.Acting is very good as well. Everyone did a great job. I especially want to mention Rachel McAdams who was Regina, the meanest girl o them all. And she was perfect in this role.There isn't anything bad about this movie that I can think of. It is funny from the very start and throughout the movie."
"'Tina Fey of \'Saturday Night Live\' fame writes the screenplay for this very entertaining teen comedy. Cady Heron(Lindsay Lohan)was raised in Africa by her zoologist parents and is thrust into public high school for the first time and must adjust to the whims, deceit and snobbishness of a girl clique known as The Plastics, that gravitates around Regina George(Rachel McAdams). She finds herself being asked to infiltrate the group in order to sabotage the most feared girls in the school. She makes a critical mistake of falling for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend(Jonathan Bennett). A \'Burn Book\' containing vicious rumors and harmful truths written by The Plastics causes chaos throughout the girl world of this upper middle class high school. Its girl against girl and friend against friend. Who can they trust? Cady goes from \'Africa girl\' newcomer to \'plastic\' to most disliked to most popular girl in school.Fey plays math teacher Ms. Norbury and a couple of her \'Saturday Night Live\' cast mates also have roles: Tim Meadows is Mr. Duvall and Ana Gasteyer plays Cady\'s mom. Others in this quirky comedy are: Lizzy Caplan, Amanda Seyfried and Amy Poehler. MEAN GIRLS is a fun movie to watch...I guess because girls will be girls. If you haven\'t fallen in love with Lindsay Lohan yet...you will soon.'"
"'I think the only reason I wanted to see this film was because gay Richard from Big Brother 7 was talking about it all the time in the house, and called many of the girls Plastics (he was a good housemate). Anyway, basically Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a new student from Africa, and quite quickly becomes friends with possible-lesbian Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) and gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). But soon enough they want her to get to know the crudest, most beautiful and most popular girls in the school, The Plastics, unofficial leader Regina George (Rachel McAdams), follower Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). As she gets to know them to tell Janis and Damian their dark secrets, she finds out they have a hate book with every person that has done something they hate them for. Also, Cady falls for Regina\'s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) along the way. There is a lot of back-stabbing and argumentative moments, and I can see why Richard used Plastics as his descriptions, but this isn\'t really one of those great teen or chick flick films, but young girls will probably love it. I guess they are called Plastics because they are pretty much like Barbie dolls, beautiful (almost), naive and compete thickos. Worth watching, at least once!'"
"'this film is the perfect answer. for the memorable scenes. for the impeccable way of revenge. for the great performances. and for many others small details who are axis of a film who represents just a trip of the viewer in the heart of the director universe. at first sigh - nothing new. or surprising. or unpredictable. at the second - a clock mechanism who remains impressive again and again. because, like each film by him, Django Unchained is a homage to the masters. like each of his films, it is a splendid demonstration of action, irony and the perfect cast. and this does Tarantino to be himself. in each occasion. because it is not only a lesson of cinema. but a travel across the cinematography history. so, nothing special from him.'"
"'This film is about the romantic relationship between a handsome, high flying drug representative and an attractive young woman with Parkinson\'s disease.It is refreshing to watch Love and Other Drugs, as it is set in a different background and a different tone compared to other romantic comedies. Jake Gyllenhaal successfully portrays a man with an irresistible charm, complementing Anne Hathaway\'s fragile and sensitive world.The nude scenes is probably the main selling point of the film and the main focus for viewers. This is understandable but is a pity, as it overshadows the deep emotional exchanges and the psychological fluctuations of the characters concerned. I love how the feelings of Jamie and Maggie got juxtaposed after the visit to the Convention for Parkinson\'s disease. Little romantic comedies touches on deeper feelings like this.Love and Other Drugs is a great romantic comedy with substance and chemistry. I loved it!'"
"'A deaf writer (Kate Siegel) who retreated into the woods to live a solitary life must fight for her life in silence when a masked killer (John Gallagher) appears at her window.Stephen King tweeted about the film on April 20, 2016, saying, How good is Hush? Up there with Halloween and, even more, Wait Until Dark. White knuckle time. On Netflix. Now, I don\'t necessarily always agree with King. He\'s a giant in horror, of course, but that doesn\'t mean taste can\'t vary. However, an endorsement from him never hurts and in this case I think he is right.Maybe this is not as good as Halloween (that seems outrageously bold), but the comparison with Wait Until Dark is perfect. While that film is a classic, in some ways this one goes an extra step -- the movie is not silent, but is very, very sparse on dialogue. That would be like Wait Until Dark being a radio drama.For Hush, we have an excellent use of reflection, the smooth camera movements are great, and everyone involved makes this far better than the average horror film. In fact, while I would say horror on average is getting worse, this film allows me to believe it can get better. I just have one question... is the title a Buffy reference or what?'"
"this film surprised me in a good way.it's taut,suspenseful and thrilling.it's a bit like the movies Hard Target(jean Claude Van Damm) Surviving the Game(Rutger Hauer,Ice-T),or the classic The Most Dangerous Game(1932).the only difference is this one's on a smaller scale and our main character is deaf.it's unpredictable and I wasn't sure how it would end.as for the acting Kate Siegel(who also co-wrote the film)stars as our heroine Maddie.Maddie is a very sympathetic character and you can't help but root for her.after watching The movie The Invitation(which I found uninspiring and sorely lacking any thing good) just prior to this movie,I was relieved that the nite wasn't a total loss.for me,Hush is an 8/10"
"'Having seen Thirteen Ghosts about four or five times already, I can say that the movie continues to be entertaining when revisited with some years in between. And I simply refuse to refer to the movie as Thir13en Ghosts; I am not a hipster having to include numbers in with letters.It is the story and ghost design that makes the movie being fun to watch again and again. The concept of trapping ghosts in a house and unleashing them to wreck havoc is just downright fun. And the designs of the ideas for the various ghosts is nothing short of visually great. They always impress me.The effects in Thirteen Ghosts are quite good and really adds to the enjoyment of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was good, and especially Tony Shalhoub impressed in Thirteen Ghosts. Normally I am not much fan of Matthew Lillard, but he was actually quite good in this movie. And F. Murray Abraham as Cyrus was just perfectly cast.Thirteen Ghosts is not a scary movie as per se, but it is worth watching for the story and the special effects.'"
"It's amazing, the Movie too but that in a moment, that People go to see a Tony Scott Film and then complain about the frantic Editing and the constantly moving Camera and the Ultra-Stylish Direction. This IS Tony Scott. It's what made him an always interesting Director. The pulsating rhythm and the flourishes that have now become clichÃ©d is a Style He helped create.This is one of His best. It is a gritty, bloody, very Violent Movie with an underlying motive for Revenge that few could argue. It is an eye for an eye Story that delivers a fiery Yarn that is a surreal study of Good vs Evil with heavy doses of Religion and Philosophy.It is a finely Acted Movie with Denzel, Dakota, and all, adding to this already engaging roller coaster ride. It is a severely saturated Sangre, especially in the second half. There are Industrial Music Samples counterpointed by the sweet vanilla sounds like Linda Ronstadt and the Soundtrack is just one of the many exciting things that the always playful Director uses to Entertain.This is an Action Fans Film with a Heart and the palpitations never end making this a unique, uncomfortable, yet satisfying Movie that never ceases to display itself as an Artistic Vision of a Real-Life tragedy."
"'I never saw the original, I\'m not a Denzel Washington fan (even though his face is all over my pajamas). But this movie was incredibly awesome.The intensity of Denzel was undeniable as he went on his killing spree. I never expected the movie to get half as violent or gory as it did - this is the kind of thing I expect to see in se7en or Saw... wow! And complementing this perfectly was a soundtrack heavy with Nine Inch Nails remixes.Now, I dislike Dakota Fanning with a passion. She\'s over-used in movies, she\'s not cute. She needs to find a new dentist because her teeth look rotten out. And when she becomes a teenager, her career is over because she can only play cute little blonde, white girls.I did like the use of Mickey in Spanish while the one guy was getting his just desserts. Very appropriate.I strongly look forward to the sequel and the prequel (Man Standing Precariously Close to an Open Flame). This film is highly recommended as the best action film of 2004 and one of the best of its genre in a long time.'"
"'I had never heard of the Fear Street books before watching this movie. What was particularly interesting was that, like Stranger Things, Fear Street: 1994 looks at the class differences. It\'s nothing great, but I did like it, and I\'ll be eager to see parts 2 and 3.'"
"'A totally amazing film by Director Quentin Tarantino was Inglourious Basterds.A group of Nazi soldiers plans to avenge the deaths of Jews throughout Europe by staging a one group hit team to kill as many Nazis as possible.They are soon drawn into a further plot-the killing of top Nazi officials including Hitler himself at a Nazi premier movie glorifying a German soldier who had killed so many.As the German Commander, Christoph Waltz was superb. His superb fluency in several languages, marked by his cruelty and evil facade, allowed him to give an Oscar-winning performance which was certainly well-deserved.Although writers of the film distorted history in their telling of this story, they deserve much credit for producing a what-have been motion picture.As the leader of the special unit, Brad Pitt was excellent with his southern drawl.This was a truly remarkable film.'"
"'The Lighthouse is one of the strangest films I\'ve ever seen. Describing it or even knowing whether or not I liked it is pretty difficult. Suffice to say, it was is a very, very unique movie...one that is quite haunting and difficult.The story is set in the late 19th century and a lighthouse keeper (Willem Dafoe) and his assistant (Rob Pattinson) arrive at the facility for their tour of duty. At first, things seem pretty mundane, though over time they both seem to be losing their minds...Pattinson\'s character in particular. Where it goes from there is ugly, disturbing and weird.This is definitely NOT a film for everyone. In fact, I\'d go so far as to say most people probably would not like the film....and fewer yet would really enjoy it. But it also is a wholly original viewing experience and I can respect the folks who made it. The acting is good....and it feels much like peeking inside the mind of a madman. Overall, not enjoyable but also pretty amazing.'"
"Off the Italian coast, Luca Paguro is befriended by fellow sea creature Alberto Scorfano who leads him to live on land. Luca runs away from his home in the sea. While on dry land, the sea creatures look human but they turn back when they get wet. They enter a small town where they are befriended by local girl Giulia Marcovaldo. The trio join up for a race competition. The boys dream of buying a Vespa with the winnings and riding away.This is a beautiful looking Disney Pixar movie. The story is simple and sweet. I do have to say that I missed the closeted gay subtext. I looked at it more in terms of passing. Quite frankly, I wanted more dangerous initial stakes. Luca is more in danger on land. It's perfectly safe for him to go home. There is a way to raise the stakes by taking away a safe return as an emergency exit. If the two boys are refugees and their ocean home destroyed, it would raise the danger and their ultimate stakes. If they have to leave the ocean, it would be a more compelling dangerous journey. There are some powerful scenes. The two boys have a complicated relationship. I love Giulia. All in all, this is wonderful Pixar and a sweet little story."
