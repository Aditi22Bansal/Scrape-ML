"'Producers will blame the poor box office of No Time to Die on COVID but that\'s not why it\'s bombing. The movie is failing because there is no audience for it. It certainly wasn\'t made for fans of the Bond films (like me). The movie looks great with terrific location photography, the title is cool and Bond girls Lea Seydoux and Ana de Armas are wildly dreamy. Other than that, this movie has little to offer. The story isn\'t that interesting and the villain is weak. If there wasn\'t a lady in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY) laughing once in a while, I wouldn\'t have even noticed the jokes. It\'s also about twenty minutes too long. No Time to Die bites the hand that feeds it. It is, hands down, the worst movie of Daniel Craig\'s not-so-hot tenure as James Bond.'"
'30 minutes in and you realize that you do not care about either the main character or the problem he is trying to solve. Jake does his best but that is not enough.'
"'The Guilty fails to come together, with a weak and empty story.Gyllenhaal no doubt commands the screen, but if you want to do a film about police brutality... Do a film about police brutality.'"
"Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a policeman awaiting trial or a hearing and has been placed on 911 duty in LA. We see him handle the first few calls where he appears to blame the victim. He is also stressed by his separated family life. He gets a call from Emily who is stressed and claims she is abducted. He does everything he can to save here and her family. Then comes the devilish twist.I have discovered I like Jake Gyllenhaal films more when I have no idea what is going on with the plot. This was basically a one man play. Jake does a convincing job, I just didn't get into it.Guide: f-word. No sex or nudity. I really thought the LA 911 call center would be more busy and how does one keep getting the same 911 operator from a different cell tower?"
"'This film start with the news broadcasting about the fire, and the introduction of the main character Joe scene! As turnout, this film is about a police officer with murder record Joe need to act as a call operator to save a psychopathic woman Emily! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the shouting scene, overuse of the hallucinate scene, overuse of the using asthma spray scene, overuse of the watching map on the screen scene, overuse of the talking on the microphone scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, and overuse of the recording by writing scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, after Joe solve Emily case, he talking about his court case at the bathroom! That\'s it! Completely wasting time to watch!'"
"'Woody Harrelson (Carnage) brings nothing to anything, just his annoying personality. Perfect tool for Carnage. It is all about Woody Harrelson being Woody Harrelson. If you have seen him ranting in Zombieland and the sequel, you know what I mean.Tom Hardy (Venom) has to be the most over-rated actor in the history of cinema. He looks like some kind of klutz, Deputy Doofy from the Scare movies, a mental defective carrying around a psychotic sociopathic parasite that wants to be a comedian. Just the most bizzarro crud you can ever imagine. This is like the modern Abbott & Costello of third-string Marvel Superheroes.Perhaps the most blatant point that everyone ignores is that there is no SPIDER-MAN in the Venom movies. Spider-man is the arch-nemesis of both Venom and Carnage. There are literally hundreds of comic books about Venom or Carnage or both of them fighting Spider-Man. Dozens of trade paperbacks. So how do you do a series of Venom/Carnage movies without Spider-Man? WTF??? How lame is that?'"
"Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend. He's actually an NPC (non-player character) in Free City, an online video game. He goes through every day doing the same thing and getting robbed multiple times. One day, he spots Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer) and his world view expands. In the real world, she is Millie suing Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing her code. She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy."
"Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."
"HALLOWEEN KILLS (2021) *** Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle, Will Patton, Thomas Mann, Jim Cummings, Dylan Arnold, Robert Longstreet, Anthony Michael Hall, Charles Cyphers, Scott MacArthur, Michael McDonald, Kyle Richards, Nancy Stephens. Filmmaker David Gordon Green (who re-unites on the screenplay with Scott Teems & Danny McBride) returns to the scene of the crime from HALLOWEEN (2018) where the attempted kill of Michael Myers by the long-suffering Laurie Strode (Curtis back in Mama Bear mode) fails to stick to the landing letting The Shape continue his bloody carnage of vengeance & homecoming, albeit amidst Haddonfield up-in-arms with a vigilante group let by Strode's former babysitting charge Tommy Doyle (Hall). While there are some impressively cool kills with so many annoying new characters to knock off, and a decent body count the film only suffers in very little for Curtis to do let alone have a moment with her sibling rivalry. Leaves the door wide open for the penultimate HALLOWEEN ENDS then."
"Well just okay! Malignant starts out with a curiosity! What's going on here at the hospital? Then we have a women in a abusive relationship. There is many Wan movie scares of bumps, and creeks in the night. Malignant gets interesting, but suddenly turns into Jeepers Creepers. Predictable and lame was the ending. Watchable, but over the top like 80's horror movie. I found the music and shots was an 80 tribute. Like many 80's horror movie Malignant is b ish. Watchable but forgettable."
"James Wan's name was suffice to pull me into seeing this. This movie has a solid n creepy twist with lots of gory mayhem n it has a nice pace.But the the foggy lair looked phony.Also the hospital on top of a hill and the parking of a car almost at the end of a fence less cliff is way too ridiculous.The chase scene was not at all required as it was unbelievable. Also a cop coming face to face with a killer and still not believing the existence of such a killer is again wtf.The sister of the lead female character walks in n outta a hospital n gets access to all the files and that too like a piece of cake.Wasn't it the job of the cops to get access to the files?They have kept it open for a sequel as aft so much mayhem n so many dead police officers, a particular character's fate needs to be seen.(Hiding the character's name to avoid spoilers).Whether that character will be thrown in a jail, or a psychiatric ward or an army research center.I thot i saw a fatter Zoe Bell lookalike but was surprised when i saw her name on imdb.Zoe Bell is totally wasted.She has indeed put on lottuva weight."
"The story is interesting, but there's not enough suspense. There's something missing."
"'A family is vacationing at a tropical paradise resort, better than Cancun. They are offered access to a special secluded beach, just for them and as it turns out a few other folks. Once on the beach, they are kept from leaving and they are aging rapidly. As it turns out someone in every family has an illness.I liked the concept as it was new to me. For the most part the beach scenes were chaos with no one knowing what was going on, including the audience. They needed to spend more time on the ending which was anti-climatic.Guide: 1 F-word. Implied sex. Near nudity.'"
"While Old starts out with an intriguing story, the idea gets fatigued quickly and the film becomes a little absent-minded. I appreciate that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to tell original stories, but the characters in this movie didn't act or speak like normal people. It took forever for them to realize what was going on, and then they suddenly leapt to all sorts of conclusions. I prefer Shyamalan's other geriatric thriller, The Visit."
"Ah the name puns. You gotta have them, right? The answer is obviously yes. So a bad or rather evil character as we know her ... or knew her? - is now back with an origin story. I have to admit, I have some issues with the movie overall or rather the morality is serves. Not to mention the kind of making away of what she becomes ... or making it ok, because of what happened to her.If you are able to leave those thoughts to the side and not be clouded by them, you may be able to enjoy this more. The story is quite straightforward - you have the evil Emma and the good Emma - which will become Evil. Sorry I can't just put this to the side. Obvious name choices to the side (and convenient happenings/accidents too), the actors do a fantastic job. The movie is quite dark for a family entertainment entry, but so was the 101 Dalmatians ... to a point.If you love those involved, you will get more out of it too. If you love dresses, you will have the time of your life - no pun intended."
"'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10."
"'Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it\'s not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of show, don\'t tell, by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don\'t mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.'"
"I had low expectations for this movie, but it didn't even meet them. I suppose there were worse action movies out there, but just not worth the time."
"This was a pretty good movie but just didn't get there for me. I don't know if i'm more used to more extreme versions of this type of movie, but it seemed fairly tame. And for the most part, it was completely predictable from beginning to end. It was funny and charming but in the end i wasn't satisfied (1 viewing, 4/7/2021)SPOILERSi just couldn't buy into her dedicating her life to what amounts to making predators feel guilty so that hopefully they won't do it again. Maybe this is more realistic than a crazy revenge scheme that ruins ppls lives or even ends them. But realistic doesn't mean entertaining."
"Amateur night.The bad: this movie looks cheaply made and is cheap. Way below average acting performances, silly story, even sillier special effects, mediocre photography.Simply no thrill whatsoever.Not any good? I honestly cant think of any. It's not laughably bad, but it comes close...."
"Why do I do it, why do I always think that the number one choice is going to be good, it never is, and there's a good example of it here.Kate has 24 hours to get revenge on those that poisoned her, that's literally the plot, that start is followed by the most improbable, crazy fight sequences you will ever see.It goes on a bit, it looks pretty good, I loved the visuals, but that's the best element, the story is wafer thin, it lacks any sort of heart.Good acting, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is cracking, I am a big fan, sadly Woody isn't around for much, and that's a real shame.All in all, another disappointing film on Netflix, 5/10."
"'Action scenes are well coreographed and there are interesting (although in a quite Orientalist spirit) sets. However, the predictable and full of clichÃ©s script seems to have been made by a machine. Music score is horrible. There are scenes (the car chase must be highlighted here) that seriously look like videogame. Indeed, so does the story. The sequence of important enemies looks like phases of a game. Too much money spent for a too unimportant and characterless movie.'"
"The crew once again comes together and saves the world. They had to create a past and make John Cena the brother of Vin Diesel and the bad guy. Jordana Brewster is back and Helen Mirren in a cameo. No Jason Stratham, but we do get Charlize Theron as the bad girl.The plot is immaterial. There is more car wreckage than what Bruce Willis did to Moscow. Roof top jumping becomes bus/truck top jumping. There is a scene which pokes fun at the FF series by discussing the infinite impossible missions that they go on and they don't die, or even get a scratch.And of course all ends well with the extended family meal.I learned you can drive through a mine field but you must be going 80 MPH or more. If you zig-zag when running away from someone shooting at you with an automatic weapon, you never get hit. Nobody know how to shoot out a tire. The Pontiac Fiero (plot spoiler) is rated for the icy vacuum of outer space. And Yoda was a puppet. Grab the popcorn, leave your mind at the door."
The gang receives a transmission with Mr. Nobody. He had captured Cipher but the plane has crashed. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) is reluctant to go on another mission and risk his family but Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) convinces him. There is a MacGuffin and Dom's newly revealed brother Jakob (John Cena). Family...The full title is Leprechaun 4: In Space. It's a bit of an insult to tag your movie In Space. Leprechaun is a campy horror-comedy franchise and its self-mocking humor uses the insult to its advantage. F&F has been approaching that line over the years and it may be a moment of jumping the shark. F&F started originally as a semi-serious fun cars & babes franchise. The action has gotten more and more ridiculous to the point of superhero unreality. Tyrese Gibson is doing a meta commentary while questioning his invulnerability. It's fitting that he and Ludacris are the ones going into space. Tyrese is the silly comic relief but it's getting out of hand. This series is being so ridiculous that it is almost critic-proof in that respect. No nay-sayer is going to win an argument by pointing out the outlandish non-sensical action scenes. We already know and it's why we watch the movies. It is what it is at this point.
"'Seriously it was pretty obvious from the start that this had zero story and was basically a feeble attempt to pass a weak porn flick off into mainstream cinemasTo be honest 50 shades of Grey was a load of ð© and this no different apart from the lead actor in this in my opinion was a lot better looking and sexier than the guy who played Christian Grey .If you want to watch some free harmless sex scenes then you may enjoy what this flick has to offer ,however if you want to be entertained intellectually then forget it! Almost forgot to mention the very annoying pop music played almost right the way through this but then again they needed something to fill the gaps in lack of script I guess!'"
"'In my life and this one comes pretty close to taking the cake. No story until the last minute, terrible acting, erotic scenes that made me laugh, weak dialog and in general hands down an awful show. Netflix must have got a huge discount on the purchase price or the director had a nocturnal emission when plotting the show. Scenery was nice though and a better actor than any of the cast. Chalk up a couple of wasted hours on Sunday afternoon. Lots of oral sex, if you\'re interested in that sort of thing but it was funny instead of erotic.'"
'... so far 502 (correction-503) have rated it 1.. and 223 a 10 ... 1-2 of all ten rating categories\n... all need be said about it ... thank god for fast-forwarding\n... all took little more than 15 minutes'
"This hardly qualifies as a film. It's basically porn with some random cringey lines and scenes stringed together. The actors can hardly even be called that and the direction is below amateur. The film essentially romanticizes kidnapping and rape too, and for that it should be ashamed. This is truly the bottom of the barrel for 2020."
"Rating it 3 not because of Rhea. I see so many reviews filled with hatred towards an accused and just because of that they have rated it 1, it's not even remotely related to the movie, sorry to see so many dumb Indians.Now to the movie, this is just dull and ridiculous. The characters start shady from the beginning, that just ruins any buildup towards a good thriller. They make it so obvious, that you can easily guess what's gonna happen.Despite a strong cast, actors don't have much to do because of a poor script.Just skip this movie. Waste of time."
"Calling this film boring would be an understatement. This film is a preachy, lethargic, crude and hollow thriller with neither style nor substance.I kept expecting something good to happen, and it never did. The plot is not good even for a short story, let alone a feature-length movie. The central mystery is really dull and it's presented in the most tedious way possible. Characters are uninteresting and the acting is flat. The monologue by Amit Ji is so preachy, stale and stupid that you really start to wonder about who wrote this crap. In my opinion, those self-righteous kooks, calling themselves protectors of law and justice, were equally at fault and should have been blamed for the casualty.This is waste of time and resources. There is no place for logic and reasoning in this film. The cinematography is good but visuals during the end sequences are reprehensible.The makers said during the release of the film that this is the film that is going to revive our theatres. If this is the kind of movie which is going to be made for theatres, let them be defunct."
"'I tried, I really did! I hoped that the fairly decent, experienced, ensemble cast coupled with state of the art visual effects and a collection of modern-day pop lyrics would breathe new life into this timeless story. Well, sadly, that was all just a triumph for optimism over, well, just about anything... It\'s terrible. Good looking, well produced, but terrible. Am I the only person left alive who is fed up being shouted at by Edina Menzel? Pierce Brosnan demonstrated in Mamma Mia (2008) that he is happy to play parts with his tongue in his cheek, but here I fear he must have cringed when he saw; likewise Minnie Driver and a whole host of British comedians led by the ubiquitously un-talented James Corden. Billy Porter tries a different take on the fairy godmother character but features all to sparingly to make much impact on an otherwise extremely pedestrian interpretation that reached it\'s nadir with the cute but totally wooden pairing of Nicholas Galitzine (Freddie Mercury would spin in his grave) and Camila Cabello. Sorry, maybe if I were 6 years old and had nothing to compare this with, I\'d not be so harsh - but I\'m not and this is poor, really poor...'"
"Well... if you know nothing about GI Joe, I guess it's good, except that Snake Eyes comes across as sort of an, well, an A-Word for most of the movie.And if you are a fan of GI Joe, this has nothing to do with Snake Eyes, the character isn't Snake Eyes, he's not even mute or horribly scared, and the movie absolutely sucks.But then, I guess if you are a fan of GI Joe, than you are toxic and the movie isn't made for you because it's made for the people who, I guess aren't GI Joe fans and is just reliant on the fans who it's not made for to make the box office returns that it didn't have because the fans who it's not made for are toxic for not seeing it.... or something like that.Anyway, it's not really a GI Joe movie, the character's aren't at all the same, and what you have is really sort of a bad kung-fu movie with choppy action, that doesn't even really work as a generic kung-fu movie because even that seems out of place and done in short and choppy motion that leaves the viewer kind of sea sick with no real idea who is doing what or what is going on when the fighting starts.So, I guess if you don't know anything about GI Joe, it might only be a bad movie and not an absolutely horrible movie."

"I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.Then i thot lets just enjoy the action but then again none of the fight scenes are noteworthy.Recently i saw Lee's Fist of Fury n i loved the Japanese garden. This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.The editing ruined everything.Cos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.The character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.How conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.Also how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad's murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.I miss those old ninja movies man."
"'Confusing yes, but good, confusingly good that is. Jason statham rides the plane like the boss of the aces high, its grumpy dirty, bloody and revengeful. One thing is for sure, this sand bank is just for the one who saw it first, so go to bed or your dead.Framing each other on multipel levels is an understatement in this armored value truckin robbin business, so keep your gobs strait, dont flip them out for cleansing cause they might get stolen. So , this is a solid criminal gold nugget, no wonder they kept it reserved for the big screen for quite a while. Its a recommend from the grumpy old man.'"
"If you want a good action movie, this is it. No bull, no complicated back stories, no pointless characters added for diversity, no mercy with any of the others. Except one scene towards the end that had no right being there, it was a damn good movie. And might I add that I thought Jason Statham played the same tough invulnerable unshakeable guy, but differently. He put a ton of stoic pain in the acting that improved this film a lot.And that's the whole review, because other than good action and movie making, there is nothing else there. Perfection is reached when there is nothing else to remove."
The first question that came to mind was which Escape Room is the a sequel to? That is answered in the opening scenes as they replay part of the first feature. We are expected to know Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) from the first film. They are captured along with other champions who we don't know and are forced back into the game of frantic people screaming and attempting to figure out puzzles in a minute or so. I was not as impressed with this film as the original.Guide: No sex or nudity. Two softly spoken F-words.
Just a horrible movie that exists only to cash in on the prequel.The characters are horrible and the 'games' are mostly moronic.Avoid!

"Great horror flick, well-made all around. Doesn't miss a beat as a continuation of the story as well as the tone and feel. Intense and suspenseful with some major tension. An awesome opening scene. Overall very enjoyable.It's hard for me to say which one is better. I think overall they are about the same. But this one had some scenes that were way better and made me think it could surpass the original. But there are other things i didn't like as much and didn't feel as natural. The original was a steadier 7 star movie, although there were some questionable parts in that one as well. (1 viewing, 5/27/2021)"

"'. . . would ever set foot in the U. S. city of Detroit. DON\'T BREATHE 2 illustrates why someone walking down a Motor City sidewalk with a small cooler is more than likely a courier transporting a vital bodily organ stolen from a freshly-murdered corpse intended for a back alley transplant operation to be performed by a defrocked surgeon without the benefit of any anaesthesia, nurses, medical monitors or basic hygiene. This film recounts how arson has replaced baseball as Motown\'s main municipal pastime, given that most of the DFD personnel have quit in recent years due to the chronic lack of bath tissue at their stations. Detroit\'s police chiefs always are more interested in making personal gubernatorial runs than in solving homicides, so this blighted region perennially vies with Mexico for having the distinction of the lowest conviction rate for murderers in the known world. DON\'T BREATHE 2 is not exaggerating a single bit as it depicts Detroit\'s chaotic mayhem and unbridled vicious violence. Take it from Mr. Hoffa: When there\'s a major crime in Detroit, the case is NEVER solved!'"
"'Despite myself, I actually rather enjoyed this. Certainly the plot is pretty far-fetched, but once the film gets up a head of steam, it is quickly paced with some well placed jump scenes that work quite well. Stephen Lang is effective as the blind fella, trying to rescue his daughter from her long-lost family, and is especially so once we find out just quite why they are so keen on re-uniting. Madelyn Grace is also quite competent as the young girl Phoenix and I found Fiona O\'Shaughnessy\'s particularly odious mother character quite detestable too. Not great, no, but kills an hour and a half easily enough and reminds you to always honour your dog - or else!!'"
"Don't Breathe 2 (2021) is a movie the wife and I caught in theatres last weekend. The storyline follows Norman Nordstrom as he lives isolated from a society that is falling apart. He protects his little girl and keeps her from local schools and hoodlums. Her curiosity puts his endeavors at risk. One day his little girl is seen in the city and a group of kidnappers follow her home. The kidnappers really don't know how challenging their task is gonna be. This movie is directed by Rodo Sayagues in his directorial debut and stars Stephen Lang (Avatar), Madelyn Grace (Grey's Anatomy), Brendan Sexton III (Boys Don't Cry), Rocci Williams (Wrath of Man) and Adam Young (Sex Education). The storyline and settings for this are way better than they should be. There's a subtle post apocalyptic feel to it with excellent violence and gore that reminded me of a slightly toned down Hobo with a Shotgun. The premise, once it's revealed, is crazy and over the top goodness. The movie starts with two fantastic kill scenes and hits the ground running. The final couple kills are cinematic gold. Loved the special effects and use of various props for their kill scenes. This is a horror fans dream movie that is an absolute must see. I'd score this an easy 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it."
"'This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new war is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes.It did not find this one as interesting and entertaining. So to distil it down, what is it about?There is an old John Denver song Poems, Prayers and Promises and part of the lyrics go like this:Talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in\nHow sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care\nHow long it\'s been since yesterday and what about tomorrow?What about our dreams and all the memories we share?And in a great sense that is what the movie is ultimately saying, find things to believe in rather than accentuate our differences. I found much of it interesting and entertaining, while I found some of it to be dull and uninteresting. It definitely isn\'t a 1 or a 2 but it also isn\'t better than about a 6 or a 7 when compared to other fantasy movies.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.'"
"I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 2/5\nComedy 0/5"
"'This movie has some really bad points. It isn\'t the worst action hero movie ever. It\'s 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there.\nFirstly the bad points:\n1. The story. This silly wish premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn\'t have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It\'s beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax.\n2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter.\nThe good points:\n1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable.\n2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role.\n3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting.\n4. Watch out for Lynda Carter.\nThe cast is good but they can\'t save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard.\n5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.'"
"Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is Nobody. He is a suburban family man doing his boring job in a non-eventful routine. One night, two masked people break into his home. His son tries to fight back but he puts a stop to it. He loses the respect of his son and others. Non of them knows about his secret violent past. When his daughter is missing a bracelet, it's the last straw and he tracks down the robbers. His path collides with a brutal Russian mobster.This is Jimmy trying to be John Wick. I don't think Odenkirk is the John Wick type. He's not quiet enough although he tries in the opening. He has a comedic energy that is vibrating to get out. The action is not quite as cool although there is plenty of it. I do not like the Home Alone booby-traps in the last part. Overall, it's an interesting attempt. I like it enough. It's good popcorn waster but it's unlikely to lead to a John Wick style franchise."
"If you get the idea for your movie from somewhere else and then you do a great film, you are an artist. What are you after you get the idea for your movie from at least three different beloved stories and still do a ridiculously bad film?That's the story of this piece of garbage which manages to mix around the ideas of Alien Earth War, The Thing and something like The Forever War or Old Man's War, gets Chris Pratt and J. K. Simmons in the cast and then takes all of that goodness and somehow manages to drive it into the ground via a latrine. The incompetence of the writer's staff for this film is astounding. Nothing makes sense in this film, I mean literally nothing.Bottom line: ignore this completely. The only worse film this year is Army of the Dead."
"...apart from the eventual moment where credits rolled, it's a decent watch, it just felt too long at times, and a bit repetitive.It's an interesting film, it's almost like a sci fi film noir, it has that moody, subdued atmosphere, and the appropriate dialogue, the contradiction comes with the water logged Cities and imaginative technology, an interesting contrast of styles.The trailers looked great, the film looks fantastic, but for me there was too much of a focus on the visuals, and not enough on the actual storytelling, which at times was a little drab. Visually though it's amazing, the futuristic world looks awesome, throw in Rebecca Ferguson's gorgeous presence and Jackman's muscles, and you have something for everyone.Imaginative, interesting, just a little too slow for me, it felt like a film hampered by restrictions, which of course it was. 6/10."
"In the near-future, Nick Bannister (Hugh Jackman) lives in a flooded Miami due to climate change. He and his assistant Emily 'Watts' Sanders (Thandiwe Newton) operate a machine for people to relive their best memories. Both are veterans of a devastating recent war. Mae (Rebecca Ferguson) walks in asking for help to find her keys and begins a relationship with Nick. She goes missing and Nick becomes haunted reliving his memories with her over and over again. The police hires him to get into a comatose suspect's memories where he discovers Mae working as a nightclub waitress. He starts investigating on his own and dives into a rabbit hole of mysteries.There is a lot to like in this near-future sci-fi noir. I like the style of it. I like Hugh Jackman. I like the idea of this concept but the concept actually imbeds a devious story landmine. It forces a lot of the action into flashbacks. The narrative becomes a labyrinthian mess. It strives for something interesting but fails to grasp it. Writer/director Lisa Joy seems to be trying to branch out on her own after her work on Westworld. She has something there but it needs work. The first thing I would work on is the title. It's trying to be Nolanesque without the self-confidence."
"I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view."
"'I normally have no interest in these films, but I find it entertaining and appealing.'"
"This sort of feels like Scott Pilgrim vs The World, but not with the same quality. If Scott Pilgrim was a 10/10 this is not even close to being a 10/10.The Pros - Good soundtrack. Quirky characters, Good cast, Cinematography, The flashbacks and the way they seamlessly integrated them in to the movie, lesbian lover assassinsThe Cons - Plot (boring and predictable), Girls (all the girls are good) vs Guys (all the guys are bad), bad guy chewing on a match stick, Fight scenes (too many cuts), choreography of fight scenes, Misc - Limited deus ex machinaRight when I thought it was over, I had to deal with another 15 minutes? At least there was one gratuitous death of the 'good guys' in the end."
"A girl's boyfriend gets brutally stabbed to death in front of her but no reaction.The entire town, the mall, the hospital, the stadium, etc are almost all empty n no significant elder shown.A hospital without any doctors n security.A minority fella working in a mall is unnecessary handcuffed in a lockup inspite of the killer being shot dead.Except for two brutal deaths towards the end, the movie is devoid of terror, tension n suspense.The death sequence of Kate (Julia Rehwald) is gory n innovative.Let's see how the sequel will fare."
"The Courier is based on true events, the Cuban Missile Crisis to be more precise. It's an entertaining movie but don't expect too much action scenes as there are almost none. It's more a spy drama about an event that the whole world knows about. The cast did a good job playing their characters. I've never been a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I have to admit he can act. He just has one of those faces I don't really like but credits to him, he can act. The Courier is certainly worth a watch, especially if you like historical facts and spy movies about the Cold War."
"I feel the story was too slow without enough substance to fill up the 112 min runtime. The premise of the story just wasn't interesting enough to be that long, and it should've been sped up and trimmed down to no more than 80 min runtime. Casting and performances were great, and probably the main reason I didn't fall asleep. Considering it was put together by fairly newb filmmakers, I'm still giving it a generous 7/10."
"'Ok, so I\'m not sold on Benedict Cumberbatch - his acting gets less remarkable the more I see him on screen, and here he does little to enliven this Le CarrÃ©-lite spy drama. Based on a true story, it depicts the courageous escapades of Briton Greville Wynne who was co-opted by British Intelligence and the CIA into working with a Russian soldier based in Moscow, to help share secrets that might avert a nuclear war over the placing of Soviet missiles in Cuba. Insofar as it is a true story, it is interesting but I found the whole presentation of the thing rather dreary. Again, the factual elements of the story rob it of any jeopardy - we know what happened/happens and so it\'s the depiction of the risks taken, the genuine threats to those involved and the seriousness of their mission that should have made this compelling. Sadly, though, Dominc Cooke\'s film just never really gets out of third gear - and the supporting cast, including his opposite number in Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze) add very little to what is essentially a single hander for which, in my view, the star isn\'t up to holding together. It doesn\'t need a big screen, and will make for an adequate late night thriller on the telly, but unfortunately it offered little more.'"
"'Frankly Grillo is in very good shape. The film has the same repetitive stuff again n again.\nThe plot n ending is terrible.\nAfter a while the film is not able to hold attention cos of the monotonous stuff.\nNaomi Watts is totally wasted n the less said bah Mad Gibson, the better.'"
"'This starts off really quite strongly. The Warren\'s - Ed (Patrick Wilson) and wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are brought in to conduct an exorcism upon a young boy but somewhere during the process, the spirit manages to swap bodies and the life of the boy\'s older friend Arne (Ruairi O\'Connor) starts to take on an unpredictable nature that culminates in him being charged for the murder of his friend - which we know he did. Was he possessed at the time of the crime? Well the Warren\'s decide that they are going to try and offer this as a form of defence and so they set about tracking down his demon and proving their point. It\'s from here on in that the thing falls away quite badly. John Noble hams up terribly, Farmiga and Wilson don\'t really work together convincingly and the ending - though quite tensely directed - just isn\'t scary in the slightest. Perhaps we are all becoming just too numb to the impact of visual effects to create menace? It is certainly becoming more difficult for a director to get those jump moments, especially with format horror like this. Sadly, truth isn\'t stranger than fiction any more and if the Conjuring is to continue, it will need quite a creative overhaul. This is worth a watch, but is pretty unremarkable.'"
'3 out of 5 stars.The third film does offer some thrills and scares. But the direction is a little less grounded this time. Getting away from the haunted house concept to following an investigation on a person being accused for murder which he was possessed.Great cast. But little less scares.'
"I find this film flat and boring. I find the story rather offensive, as they make fun of a person who appears to be vulnerable. I can't get into it at all."
"I would give the worst to That's My Boy(2012), and some others like Mr. Deeds(2002), You Don't Mess The Zohan(2008) and Jack and Jill(2011). But Pixels was his fun to me, has we'll has Anger Managment(2003). Where does Hubie Halloween fall into that, we'll it's pretty bad, the plot goes all around, it's what you'd expect from this type of Adam Sandler comedy, but there where two times I did laugh.\nAdam Sandler gives an over the top performance as Hubie, to the point where he seems to animated to be a real character that can be relatable, Julie Bowen is in this movie just to have a love interest for Sandler, nothing more. And everything else falls flat, Kevin James looks like he's not having any fun here. Halloween comedies can be done, but Hubie Halloween does not quite do it."
"'Adam Sandler stars as the title character as he attempts to impersonate Bill Murray in Caddy Shack. Not as good and not as funny. Hubie gets Steve Buscemi as a new neighbor which is scary in itself. Hubie is the picked on village idiot who tries to do good in the town of Salem at Halloween. It has word play b*ner jokes as the funniest aspect of the movie, to give you a clue. The cast includes a bunch of known names and Sandler uses his family in a way that would make Judd Apatow green with envy. Now that would have been funny having him in the film turning green watching Adam using his kids. It was wasted potential.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. Just stupid jokes.'"
"Too many unnecessary scenes and infantile dialogue riddled with foul language you'd never expect to hear from those spewing it. There was way to much time spent on filler and not enough on substance. What was the point of that entire outdoor drinking on picnic tables act? The pick-up truck parachute and arrest scenes? The constant repetitive flashbacks only inching each time just a little more facts on her past incident also became annoying. Just spit it out, and move on with the current drama and all too little excitement. Never mind it was totally boring and pointless for the movies plot-line. Even the idea of the cat and mouse wasn't concluded, nor why it even started or who ordered it. The screenplay felt like it had random scenes cut out and/or was poorly edited. The 100 min runtime felt much longer with all the boring filler. I'm not sure if the book is as bad at the screenplay and direction, but this one had a great conceptual idea that ultimately burns out quickly. Jolie was the worst casting choice, and for the most part was unconvincing in her role and her acting abilities. Her swearing trying to act all tough with her long stringy hair was just getting annoying and unbearable. The little boy was more believable than her. Too bad, the premise was great, was it was poorly executed."

"The film is only fairly entertaining, but it is very predictable. There's quite a bit of advertising in it, the logo of a sports brand is prominently displayed on two occasions. The inclusion of other Warner brothers films are too hard sell as well. Overall, it is a brainless film that is not very brilliant."
"'Extreme unrealistic stereotyping of teaching styles & classroom student behavior. Came across as a promotional film for alcohol. Opening monologue of roughly, We\'re born to have a BAC (blood alcohol content) of 0.05%; in other words born with a deficit of 0.05%, (1-2 glasses a day) to maintain a happy state of mind; to increase social & professional teaching. Please!, they wouldn\'t last a week while imbibing before and/or during class time. Happy party scene at the end was pure dumb.'"
"This film from Thomas Vinterberg is well made with good performances, but it weirdly suffers from being both predictable (drinking too much inevitably leading to negative consequences) and from glamorizing alcohol use (for both kids and middle-aged men). You could say that's a good thing, that a black and white view is not presented, or that it accurately reflects Danish culture, but it just seemed kind of off, or in any event, it wasn't very compelling to me. I liked the score with its interesting mix of songs, and Mads Mikkelsen's dance moves. Overall, though, I didn't think it was particularly honest about the experiment the teachers embark on or the main character's trajectory, with that joyful ending. It seemed like it wanted to have it both ways, and would have been better remaining a dark statement on the culture of drinking, from adolescence through adulthood."
'Take away the CGI and the A-list cast and you end up with film with less punch than almost any Disney movie from the 1960s.'
"'The 4th in the series of reimagined monsterverse movies finally sees Kong and Godzilla brought together. In the mythology of this series they are both on our side, kinda, as Titans, avatars of worldwideworthness, but they are also huge rivals. In particular, Big G can sense Kong leaving Skull Island: apparently he needs to go home to get an upgrade, and home is apparently the hollow centre of the Earth. We also have a number of human factions, all of whom have their own agendas.There is quite a lot of apparent plot here, but much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. However, it is nicely played by a good cast (no Nick Fury, Captain Marvel or Loki, but we do have the lady baddie from Iron Man 3). There is also a great deal of utter, utter nonsense: Florida to Hong Kong by secret high speed underground tube travel in what appears to be 10 minutes, anyone?But, of course, this is all about a pair of 400 foot tall antagonists beating the snot out of each other, and that is there in abundance. Hong Kong will never be the same. And, unlike the first in this series, you can actually see what\'s going on.It really is the most ludicrous tosh but, even while I was shaking my head at how preposterous it was, there were times when I felt like cheering.This is hugely enjoyable big-budget trash cinema.'"
"Not bad, while message heavy I think that wad kind of the point. The acting was decent and the main cast had good chemistry. For 'the purge' it lacked the gritty fighting I would have expected. Storyline was pretty basic and had a good but expected ending."
"'The Forever Purge is an Action - Horror movie and the fifth movie of The Purge franchise in which we watch another annual purge happening but this time it does not stop after twelve hours but continues and seems that will never end.I did not have high expectations from this movie because I had watched all the previous movies of this franchise and the plot is more or less the same in all those movies. The direction which was made by Everardo Gout it was good and he presented the main characters in a nice and simple way while he focused not only on the purge but also on the back stories of his characters. The interpretations of Tenoch Huerta who played as Juan, Josh Lucas who played as Dylan Tucker, Ana de la Reguera who played as Adela and Leven Rambin who played as Harper Tucker were good for a movie like this. Lastly, I have to say that The Forever Purge is another similar purge movie of the franchise without adding anything new so, if you have already watched the previous I do not suggest you to watch it and spend your time on it.'"
"'This film start with two people walking, and they went into a tunnel scene! As turnout, this film is about a man Juan need to survive from the killing of a bunch of people refuse to end The Purge, and eventually reunite with his lover Adela! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the training horse scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the news broadcasting scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the dining scene, overuse of the long angle scenery scene, and overuse of the staring scene! Make the film unwatchable! The only intensity in the film is the explosion scene! The car crash scene also very slow! All the killing scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, shaky, just hear the gunshot sound, have slow motion in it, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Juan killing the last people refuse to end The Purge, and unite with Adela! That\'s it! Another disappointed sequel!'"
"'I\'m not just talking about the Warner Bros. and HBO Max same day streaming and theatrical release schedule, either, or referencing the general avoidance of cinemas during the pandemic, although I do generally miss the bigger picture, although not so much in the case of The Little Things. It having the uninspired quality of a 1990s lesser crime drama variation of Seven (1995) to it (indeed, it was originally written and appears to be set in that decade), I could imagine being satisfied waiting a few months to rent a VHS copy of it, or not seeing it at all. Starring Denzel Washington, Rami Malek and Jared Leto, there\'s a lot of Oscar-winning talent wasted here. Washington gets one brief characteristic outburst during an interrogation where he seems to break character to play the caricature of himself he often plays, but for the most part everyone is relatively subdued. It\'s a run-of-the-mill serial killer murder mystery with hardly any artistry to remark upon. Even the supposed ambiguities or uncertainties are uninteresting. The little things of this genre piece may be there, but there\'s no bigger picture to validate it.'"

"'You know how they say: there\'s nothing new in the zombie genre? Well, this movie 1000% proves that to be true.The tagline should\'ve read: If you liked I Am Legend, Aliens, Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula, Resident Evil, Resident Evil: Extinction, Warm Bodies, Escape from New York, Zombieland and Ocean\'s 11, then you\'ve already seen Army of the Dead! (And I know I must\'ve missed another 6-7 films this straight-up ripped off.)As stated, this barely had a new idea, but probably worse, it had almost zero characters to root for. No one was that likable and everyone\'s fate is so horribly predicted from moment one. This felt much less like an homage, than just a very poor attempt at plagiarism.The one Brightside was the Nice Vegas backdrop and creativity with the Strip. I also knew they were filming inside The Cromwell during the pandemic (which probably wasn\'t safe at the time) so it was neat seeing how they transformed the place.Nope, can\'t recommend. The aforementioned movies are 10x better than this cheap cheat. Save yourself from the excruciatingly long and unnecessary 148 minutes.'"
"'This initially seemed promising.However after half an hour the film started to drag.Pointless scene followed pointless scene.I sat there hoping for something to happen,but really little did.'"
"I don't really understand this story. She makes some choices in the film, but the reason she makes these choices aren't explained."
"'An explosion near a train kills some passengers. Among the dead is a man who was going to testify against the bike gang, Riders of Justice. A man who creates algorithms (ones that can tell us rich people drive Mercedes and poor people drive Kias) survived the blast and believes it could not be coincidental. He believes a man who exited the train had something to do with the blast. He involves a few other people, including military man Mads Mikkelsen who lost his wife in the explosion. They enact a plan of revenge.The film also looks at how things interact, how small unrelated events trigger larger ones. In this instance, an Estonian girl wanting a blue bicycle as opposed to a red one starts it all off. The group of characters are enjoyable and there are a number of light moments. I liked the ending.I watched the film with subtitles.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity. No sex.'"
"First I want to say how great this state-of-the-art animation is. As my wife commented early in the movie, it's hard to believe that is animation. The effects, the facial expressions, everything. Second it took over 900 people working in over 400 homes during the worldwide pandemic to pool their talents to make this movie. Quite an achievement.But all that wouldn't matter if the story were blah. It in fact is a cool story in a fictional Asian world where some time earlier a menacing force turned many people and even dragons into stone. However it turns out one dragon remains and together with the young heroine they seek to reunite the several fractured factions of people to reclaim their former peace and cooperation.We enjoyed it at home on BluRay from our public library."

"'I really was expecting a bit more from this. The premiss that a bunch of bored, rich, folks kidnap a dozen deplorables and plonk them in a wood whereupon they are hunted with guns, grenades and good old bows and arrows could have been quite fun. A sort of Hunger Games without the endless CGI. What we do get is a really tame, poorly executed horror flick in which virtually all of the dozen are dead within the first five minutes and we embark on a truly implausible hunt by the survivors to turn the tables. The two in the gas station inject a little levity into the proceedings but otherwise it is rather a missed opportunity that will not linger long in the mind.'"
"Two thirds of the film you are going to ask yourself two questions: 1. Why is the movie called Sweet Girl when it is all about Jason Momoa? And 2. How can that little adolescent turd not be wrecked with guilt for her stupidity and instead is sanctimonious and judgemental with her father and continues to never listen to anything he says? The twist provides the answer to both and it's pretty satisfying, but it works for about a second before you realize that it invalidates most of all the other things that happened until then. Then comes the ending, which is really weak.Maybe if I could have been invested in any of the characters beyond a generic sob story and a generic villain that anyone hates, I would have enjoyed it more. There is no positive to watching the film, the action scenes are generic, the story is generic, the characters are generic. Other than the twist, which feels very 1990s anyway, there is nothing that is not forgettable five minutes after the credits roll."
"Gave it a good half hour before turning it off. I like to give films a chance but it didn't keep my interest. I felt like it was a generic action film and whilst action is great in films, script is more important."
"A problematic film, this one, but not without merit. Localised and shot in and around Pittsburgh so as a Romero fan that was a nice treat. Jason Momoa can do this kind of role in his sleep by now so he's as good as you'd expect. The big pharma back story is very timely, but it never really ties up with the BOURNE style hitmen and bodyguards running around all over the place, it doesn't feel too realistic. The writing is kind of sloppy here. As for the big twist at the climax, I didn't mind it all that much personally but I can see how some might. One strong point is the action choreography which is always on point."
"'I\'ve never been there but a have a soft spot with any movie that\'s filmed in and around Pittsburgh, PA. I blame it on the films of George Romeo but who knows? The terrific location photography is the only part of Sweet Girl that\'s worth watching. It\'s a silly piece of propaganda aimed at an audience that\'s too old to care.

"This is a nice movie that's generally well made. but it's just too boring. tom hanks is his usual awesome self. but i question if this story was worth making a movie out of. there isn't enough substance or intrigue. (1 viewing, 2/3/2021)"
"The story is good, especially the final scene. However, it doesn't resonate with me, as their lives are so far from mine."
"The special effects are good, but I didn't get into the story. There's also little chemistry between yet m the two leads."

"'In 2257 there is a colony in New World. There is a village of all men who can read each other\'s thoughts. They have been out of contact for a long time. A scout ship crashes with Viola (Daisy Ridley ) being the sole survivor. Unlike men, women\'s thoughts can not be read, but they can see the thoughts of men. The Mayor (Mads Mikkelsen ) wants to do her harm. Viola takes off with Todd (Tom Holland ) to seek refuge in another village.I didn\'t like the noise gimmick. It made the film annoying to watch as we hear people talk while their thought is going at the same time as we watch thought-action inside the real world. As typical Daisy Ridley has very little personality.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
"'The story: cops who were corrupt get slaughtered by a serial killer. Can cop Chris Rock find the serial killer?The good: beautifully photographed.The bad: cheap violence cant cover up the fact that this movie is below average, at best. The supporting actors are mediocre, but worse, the 2 great actors Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson act below par as well. The dialogues and the story are simply boring and full of the usual cop cliches we have seen a zillion times before.More bad: there is no real suspense. There are no jokes either. The action / horror is cheap and only used to cover up that this movie is boring from start to finish.This movie is made without any soul or originality. The money to make a good movie was there, but the time and will was not.'"
"'What a piece of garbage!\nMaybe if some pre-teen girls are gathered for a movie night together. Busy with their phones and tablets, so the movie dont interrupt them to much. This movie would maybe be somewhat okay....\nThe storyline is terrible, and the acting is non existing!\nThen she want, then she dont want, then she want, then she dont want and so on....

"First of all, this movie series is not for those whose idea of love is like that which they see in disney movies. This film series shows a realistic portrayal of love. Even though I personally don't enjoy romantic movies, I had enjoyed the first movie because it is realistic.Now coming to this movie, it was ruined by overacting by almost everyone especially the main leads. As a direct sequel to After, this movie focuses on Tessa's job as an intern and how she deals with the revelation from the first movie. The poor plot and poor execution along with overacting are exactly what ruined the whole movie.Another thing I noticed is that a few characters from the previous movie were played by different actors. What's up with that? The director is also different."
"Margot Robbie is the joker ... not the Joker, but like a joker. As in I love her so much, it is almost impossible for me to see a movie with her and not like it. Ok jokes aside, her character has finally some development here, in stark contrast to the Suicide Squad movie she was a part of.Concentrating on women is generally a good thing. The problem some may have is not that, but the cliches that will become quite apparent throughout the movie. Not to mention the sheer luck (or coincidence?) the main characters seem to have. If you don't mind this and are all for female (em)power(ment) and don't mind the one brush of character our bad guy has (Ewan McGregor is still quite amazing, even with so little to play with, no pun intended) ... you will have fun. Not everything has to be excellent ... still a long way to come back on top though"
"This seemed like a story DC Comics did for the sake of getting it out of the way. I didn't care much for it, not being able to warm up to any of the characters. I haven't read any comics in a couple of decades, but any so called super-heroes who don't make the A-list I generally have no patience for. I wouldn't even call these 'Birds of Prey' super-heroes in the traditional sense. Black Canary's (Jurnee Smollett) ability to scream her way out of a jam is about the lamest thing I think I've seen in the genre. The best thing to witness in this picture are the well choreographed fight sequences which are impeccably timed and quite creatively accomplished. Most disappointing was the camera's non-flattering treatment of Rosie Perez as Detective Renee Montoya; it seemed like a casting error in contrast to the other members of the group. Given the 'f' word strewn dialog and callous behavior of all these 'birds', I'd suggest you look for your role models elsewhere. Not to mention locking your kids up in the basement when this comes on."

"The best part of this movie was the acting, a far better cast than the first part and more chemistry between the leads. The problem was the lack of slasher action, both in volume and diversity. It takes 40 minutes for the plot to get going and then it's one note til the end."

'Watching the ice road was like watching a movie in slowmo. The fight scenes were terribly coordinated and dragged out. For such a simple objective the actors spent a lot of time standing around and bumbling about. The script was poorly written and the plot was thin. Shaky science and lame CGI. A poorly made mess.'
"'I have seen ALL Liam Neeson movies and I watch every new one. Unfortunately this one is lacking punch. It is not a bad movie, simply never getting really suspenseful at all. Kinda boring to be honest, not something I wish for in an action movie...The bad: mediocre supporting actors, mediocre dialogue, mediocre photography, mediocre direction. Get the drift?Not any good? This is still a Liam Neeson movie in which he saves the day and becomes a hero. He is still the solid, good guy who will fight for the right cause.Not recommended though because there are many better other Liam Neeson movies out there.'"
"'. . . warning our USA Homeland about a threatening incursion of an invasive counter-culture which belligerently refuses to assimilate into our hallowed melting pot. Viewers need look no further than the flags of IN THE HEIGHTS to detect how divisive, imminent and overwhelming these insurgent dangers actually are. You\'ll be able to see one single, solitary Stars and Stripes out of your peripheral vision during HEIGHTS\' 133-minute running time (blink, and you\'ll miss it) as opposed to at least 74 Communist Cuban banners front and center for seemingly half of this dance marathon. Beyond the grotesque gyrations constantly blockading the U. S. taxpayers\' public streets, this cautionary tale stresses the wanton moral turpitude of the foreign flag loyalists. Everyone knows that Tee Key Torch marchers are as vile as they come, so of course we see such a burgeoning parade here at 1:31:42. Whether it\'s fixing the lottery results, evading immigration laws, purse-snatching, shoplifting or violent ice cream wars, HEIGHTS deftly depicts an incoming tsunami wave rife with lawless disrespect of American norms, expectations and traditions.'"
"'The film is not an upbeat musical that I was expecting. It is actually quite depressing, about an immigrant community experiencing hardship in a deprived area. The story is quite slow. The only impressive scene was the synchronised scene, but that was too short. The songs are not very good, and I found a particular song likening New York subway to slave trade rather distasteful. Overall, I did not enjoy it.'"
"With this phenomenal cast it should have been a slam dunk decent thriller, its probably not just a 1 but based on my expectations with the director and cast I was expecting so much more. It really never takes hold or has any tension that you expect in a thriller. The premise starts ok but fizzles out and the ending is extremely negative and reveals nothing you dont see a mile away. I mean go read who's in the cast and you'll agree wow we have a classic coming. It was free so not upset so GLAD I didnt see this in the theater!!"
"'This is a heist movie. For any heist movie, you\'re better off just re-watching One Crew over the Crewcoo\'s Morty. The genre is formulaic by design, often involves a cast of very well known people and movies in it should be performance pieces. I mean, no one cares about the loot or what happens in the end, they just want to be entertained by the loops and twists of the story and the way actors make you care about their characters. And on that metric, No Sudden Move is average at best.Right now I am struggling to mention anything that might be worth mentioning and getting nothing. It\'s not like people acted badly, but their characters were completely uninteresting and the story went nowhere. Even if it was inspired from the story of the catalytic converter and the collusion of all big car manufacturers to keep it off the market, which is true, the rest was complete fiction. And the plot? Just people double and triple crossing each other. No action, no real stakes, no inspiring end. Just Soderbergh being nostalgic over the times when the Ocean\'s N movies were bringing him a lot of money.Bottom line: I can\'t recommend it yet I can\'t say it was a bad movie. It was just... uninteresting.'"
"'The film uses (PLOT SPOILER) the suppression of the catalytic converter by the auto industry as a back story. In Detroit 1954, three men are to babysit a family while dad breaks into his boss\'s safe to get documents, documents that have been removed.The plot is rather jerky in how it moves taking enjoyment out of the feature. It s always nice to see Ray Liotta get beat up. Matt Damon in an uncredited role explains the workings of the world.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
Fairly good CGI of monster insects turning the tables on humans to make them the munchies. Not very believable that only insects & invertebrates get to supersize (also not structurally possible per even high school science).\nCause: The usual asteroid episode encounter w/Earth. Teen hook of teen goes on perilous journey (accompanied by dog of course) to see girlfriend. Left open a sequel monster mash. High school drama class level acting & dialogue.\nI'm rooting for the insects to clean up Earth.
"'This horror movie is so pc or en woky that the director and writer forgot the horror - this German movie is an excellent example of what\'s wrong with many, if not most, movie productions these days - too many people who have a mission are involved or people who just ride comfortably and without taking any risk on the wave of zeitgeist. Really, I confess, I was on one side annoyed but on the other side fascinated - in past times people wanted to make a horror movie to entertain and maybe add their footprint into the making of the art of horror. Today, people seem to be contend to clean everything with total pc stuff and call it creative and progressive (I call it comedy) but just use an overused plot and make necessary woky changes. Orson Wells would have a lot of fun these days. Anyway, back to the movie - production, effects, gore and acting is below average. Wrong Turn 2021 - a movie nobody really needs (besides a certain kind of people). Watch the movie with the same title from 2003 again (no matter if this movie is related to the franchise or not, if not it is a money grabber too) and your time is far better spend.Last note: in a certain sense the title of the movie is what one could be tempted to call prophetic.'"
"The problem here are the good guys. They come across as purely horrible people. When you first meet them they irritate you, and they do it in the same vapid way people that have a BA in BS think they educated enough to decide what is best for everyone on earth living in situations they have never experienced....... and that attitude carries over to their interaction with the locals, who they insult and belittle in a way that is framed to almost side with the protagonists.So, when the killing starts, they have annoyed you to the point that you want them to lose, and you want to see the backwoods cannibals eat them... just so you don't have to hear them drone on and on in their pedestrian hipster snobbery any longer.So you there is no suspense, no hope that the protagonists make it out a live, because the film took enough time to make certain they irritate you to no end. And that kills the suspense.And then, on the other side, they muted the backwoods hillbilly cannibals too in both appearance and Deliverance style redneckiness, so there is really nothing grotesque or horrible about them, and, instead, so they really aren't frightening, not so deformed, not at all horrific.In fact, the only thing that makes them remotely decent is the fact that they are killing the other characters that annoyed you to the point you wanted to walk away... about 10 minutes into the film."
Should've had horror when the car has a flat tire is probably the worst thing about it. Other than the car aspect this Wrong Turn is epic more horror than expected but the main characters aren't very likable where as unfortunately I wouldn't mind if they all died. Its a very mediocre adaptation of a masterful horror! So many bad things happen that's not exciting for the genre; one of few occasions where I support the villains. The terror/violence is easily the best aspect by far!
"'But ever so cliched, dumb descisionmaking kinda story, with a clumsy caracterbuilding and messed up timeline. it also lacks the realfeel acting, a script that could be better evolved and the historical basement very loose, quite stupid actually., when a load of raindeer calves threatening you with stone and bone quacking some kind of icelandic esperanto, wheres the coherence.apart from some brute forcede bloody gore in between and some fine scenic shoots, there aint much to talk about, so do take the right turn, as the grumpy old man didnt.its a no recommend...'"
"A group of friends set out to hike the Appalachian Trail. After getting lost they stumble across a sinister man in a strange outfit. This meeting will have a profound impact on their lives and see their lives threatened by a strange cult.The 2003 Wrong Turn was a surprisingly decent horror movie, with a reasonably good plot and good performances. The success of this film caused the producers to create five sequels, all of which were incredibly bad, being made for the money and falling back on the usual horror clichÃ©s and formulae.This film is essentially another one of those sequels, relying entirely on the Wrong Turn name without bringing anything original to the table. Quite dull and formulaic with a middle section that doesn't make too much sense.Avoid."
"'This year\'s sure-fire Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature and probably Best Original Score, Soul is a brilliant mess of a movie more likely to appeal to adults than to children who almost certainly won\'t \'get\' it, (and they certainly won\'t get the references to A Matter of Life and Death unless they have sophisticated cineaste parents). In some ways it\'s both old-fashioned and ground-breaking, at least in its attempt to push the boundaries of children\'s animation while never reaching the sublime heights of say The Incredibles or Inside Out. The animation may be extraordinary but we\'ve been here before.The title, of course, has more than one meaning. Soul might refer to what a good jazz musician puts into his music but more fundamentally here it also refers to what we are all said to carry within us. Quite early in the film our hero finds himself on a \'Stairway to Heaven\' to give that Powell and Pressburger film its other title and from here on it alternates between the avant-garde and that old-fashioned Pixar formula right down to a talking cat, (big mistake). A brilliant voice cast, (Jamie Foxx, Tina Fey, Angela Bassett, Daveed Diggs and a surprisingly cast Graham Norton of all people), do what they can with the material but the scirpt is uninspired and it is noticeably lacking in gags, (I think kids will get bored quite quickly). Not one of the greats, then and maybe not even the best animation of the current year.'"
"'I\'ve recently been watching Roald Dahl\'s Tales of the Unexpected and thought this would be along similar lines, but it turned out to be more a movie for kids. I even turned to my wife as the witch coven began blowing up and turning into rodents stating, can you believe we\'re watching this? This while our twelve year old granddaughter sits on a laptop with her Roblox; I would have had her watch this with us to get her take on it. The picture is mildly entertaining, though I will say the direction given Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch left a lot to be desired. She was just too irritating, although that was probably the point. Now that you\'ve got my mild warning, I\'d advise you to haul a couple of kids into the room to watch this with you, as it would probably make the experience more enjoyable. I did like the comforting advice offered by Octavia Spencer\'s character, the old Grandma in the story, when near the end she stated to her three little mice - Never give up what you are inside. But I don\'t know if it was a good idea to leave her grandson and friends as tiny rodents. What kind of message is that?'"
"Essentially a two-hander concerning both prominent Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton and hustler-turned-FBI-informant Bill O'Neal, 'Judas And The Black Messiah (2021)' tells one of the many frustrating tales surrounding the US government's shady but nowadays not-so-secret efforts to quash any form of racial equality within its jurisdiction. O'Neal is, for the most part, the piece's POV character, acting as a way for the audience see behind the scenes of both the Black Panther party and the FBI's efforts the crush it. That doesn't mean that Hampton is relegated to a lesser role, though; he dominates the screen whenever he's present, yet he's humanised in such a way that he comes across as much more than a series of rousing speeches and steadfast negotiations. Both characters are played almost to perfection, their respective actors - Kaluuya and Stanfield - encapsulating the dualities and nuances that the script demands. It's great stuff all around, an expertly crafted production with an admirable intent and the often overlooked ability to really get you invested in its story - which, in this case, relates not only to an under-seen aspect of history but also to something that's still keenly relevant to this day. The narrative is really upsetting - angering, even - because it tells the tale of a total massacre of justice; the betrayals of the picture - which extend beyond its title's bold metaphor - hit you where it hurts. 7/10."
'2 out of 5 stars.Jolt is a bad action comedy film. Lacks the humor and comedic moments. Filled with cheesy direction that tries to keep the energy electric pacing. Plot about a girl Lindy (Kate Beckinsale) who has an impulse rage control which she uses an electric device to keep her anger down. When she finds a guy she may love. And something happens. She goes on a revenge spree to find the bad guys responsible.Plot is thin. And forgettable. A twist that may be predictable and lacks the surprises. Except for a fun surprise cameo of who shows up at the end.The action sequences are forgettable. And dull fight scenes with a fast editing scenes put together. Boring music score and dull direction.Kate Beckinsale is great but her talent is wasted in this action role.'
"Kate Beckinsale tries to pull off a Charlize Theron in her latest sci-fi actioner (in the same universe as Crank) to middling results. Not that her arse-kicking is any less exciting. The awkward wig, cosmetics and the obvious presence of a stunt double aside, she's quite solid as this I-hate-people protagonist with an anger problem. But the central plot is so thin and unexciting that the only fun the film offers is in its fast-paced set-pieces. The core element of aggression (being subdued with the aid of mild electrocution) is simply used to deliver short and thrilling but generic pieces of action. The supporting acts (featuring the likes of Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney, and Bobby Cannavale) are just what they need to be. The writing (by Scott Wascha) is utterly weak, with a nonsensical plot, zero character development, and some really silly dialogue at times. Jolt is the kind of film that'll get erased from your mind pretty soon after you've seen it."
"'Well, I\'m a little bit puzzled and lost. It\'s not bad movie. First half was really good and funny, second half lost it\'s unique point and just lost me as a viewer. Why I\'m puzzled? This movie is called Tom and Jerry and we see them less than half of movie. Better option woul be to change this movie tittle to Tom and Jerry stuck in comedy or Tom and Jerry traveled into different dimension. Now, we see real people and everything, except that, all animals are animated. In one of scenes flowers were animated also. I didn\'t get why and it wasn\'t explained. As an adult I found this film not bad but if the main audience is family with childs I think kids won\'t like this movie. I liked that they added scenes from Tom and Jerry TV episodes, it was very nostalgic. Film was ok, I would recommend to watch it but it still needs a lot of changes to consider as Good or classic movie.'"
"Bhoot Police review :A desi Ghostbusters type movie and a supposed horror comedy; Bhoot Police neither scares nor tickles your funny bone. At most, it makes you angry at the slip shod plot, drab screenplay and a rather uninspiring performance from the entire cast. Director Pavan Kirpalani, who made Ragini MMS (2011) and Phobia (2016) earlier, goes horribly wrong this time.If the idea was to make another 'Stree' (2018), sorry to say but Bhoot Police doesn't grab your attention for even a minute from start to finish. In fact, the first five minutes itself make you realise that this is going to be one bore of an endeavor. Saif and Arjun are ineffective. Yami appears lost. Jacqueline looks sexy and still can't act saala. As for Rajpal Yadav and Javed Jaffrey, I sincerely hope that it was the lure of a fat fee which made them sign up for such thankless roles!!Without wasting any more time and effort, I end my rant review with an AVOID warning.Regards,\nSumeet Nadkarni."
"The script could've much better. Still it was good. Fun, entertaining and some mindless horror sequence. Saif, Jaaved and Yami were good. Arjun was just okay. Jamie lever performed better than Arjun and Jacqueline."
"Previously, Pavan Kripalani has given us unique horror films like Ragini MMS and Phobia. But, this time he completely failed.The World they tried to create here was really visually good looking, but it was not enough. The script was very poor. It's neither funny nor scary. No dialogues made me laugh. And the scary moments were clichÃ©d.I only liked Yami Gautam in this film. Besides, I didn't like any of the characters.As there's nothing in the film, you can definitely miss this.Available on Disney+ Hotstar.Â© MandalBros."
"'What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, 6 Underground, Ronin, and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let\'s break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it\'s all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer\'s kidnapped son. It\'s pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn\'t need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn\'t even ask the price. Some odd hours later he\'s in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. Extraction was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It\'s a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.'"
"'Greetings from Lithuania.The first mistake of Host (2020) i think that in its 56 min. length it was hardly possible to establish 4 or 5 characters at the same time. There was only a situation and jump scares - and that is it, that is the whole thing (I can\'t even call it a full feature film). In Host you get a premise as old as a Blair Witch herself. And we have seen all this stuff being done so many times, and in a so many better horror film. Even a first Paranormal Activities movie was a masterpiece in comparison with this one, because it took its time to establish situation and characters. Unfortunately Host doesn\'t have any of this. And there is also one dude Teddy i think was his name, who was so obnoxious that i was pretty happy when he was out of the picture at the end so to speak - literally.Overall, Host isn\'t a terrible movie, and you can see an attempt to make something good on a very low budget and premise. That is not a bad thing, if its done right. But in 56 min. you only get bunch of jump scare scenes with some faces on a laptops. This is what Host basically is.'"

"What was the point of the first half of the movie?So I am kinda confused. The start of the movie shows a boy being saved by a Witcher from a monster that kills all his sisters or friends. He gets taken in by the Witchers grows up, then becomes the Witcher that saves himself as a child...then the story continues from here.. But i am seriously confused. I did not fall asleep or anything. It makes no sense to me but even without this, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. Nightmare of the wolf? What nightmare? What wolf? Not much content in this movie, yet not too bad of a flick."
"'The Woman in the Window is not a remake of Rear Window. It deals more with questioning one\'s sanity (whether or not this involves gaslighting). Not a masterpiece, but worth seeing.'"
'3 out of 5 stars.Fair film. Psychological thriller that offers some twists and turns. But is a bit dull at times. Decent cast.'

"Unfortunately, the good nonsense (Cage as a mute monster fighter obsessed with pinball, the design of Willy's Wonderland) is lost in the bad nonsense (cheap filmmaking, lazy storytelling, complete illogic between scenes). I would love to see a better filmmaker (Edgar Wright, James Gunn, Rogen/Goldberg), or even a much worse filmmaker, take on a possessed-Chuck-E-Cheese story...but I feel like this might've been the one chance, and we BLEW it!"
"A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E. Cheese's with animatronic figures in individually themed rooms. The place is a mess and he's locked in overnight. Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.I like the general premise and the place. I love Cage's obsessive cleaning although his character should start differently. Instead of a bad mother driving a muscle car, he should be a simple workman driving a beat-up truck. He should be poor which would explain him working as a janitor more easily. I like the teen group for the most part and they are good cannon fodder anyways. I like the animatronic killers although the killings get a bit repetitive. It's lots of fun the first time around but it gets a diminishing return with each kill. All in all, it's fun for awhile but the fun does diminish."
"'I Care a Lot is a Comedy - Crime movie in which we watch a woman working as legal guardian and taking advantage of elderly people to drain their savings. A lot change when she does the same to another elderly woman but she is more than she appears.I liked this movie because it was different, it had an interesting plot and some good interpretations. The only thing I did not like it was the way the plot was presented and how it was changing through the whole duration of the movie. At first I though that it would be a crime, thriller movie but after some time I understood that it\'s a comedy. The interpretation of Rosamund Pike who played as Marla Grayson was simply amazing. Other interpretations that need to be mentioned were Peter Dinklage\'s who played as Roman Lunyov and Dianne Wiest\'s who played as Jennifer Peterson. To sum up, I have to say that I Care a Lot is a nice comedy movie to spend your time with but do not expect much otherwise you will be disappointed.'"
"This movie sucks!A complete waste of a great lead cast, especially Tony Jar.The audio is abysmal.The story is worse than the audio.All the fights are mediocre at best.The visuals are beautiful and easily the only good thing about the movie.Sets up for a sequel that's NEVER going to happen."
"'Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed The New Mutants (2020) more then I thought I will be. Don\'t get me wrong - this isn\'t a great movie, and I enjoyed it mostly as a guilty pleasure. It had a nice plot that was mysterious and pretty spooky at the moments. It kept me guessing and I enjoyed it. This flick was also pretty nicely paced as at its running time 1 h 34 min it barely dragged. Performances were pretty descent by Anya Taylor-Joy and Maisie Williams - given the material. Unfortunately Blu Hunt wasn\'t that good.Overall, with lesser budget and a new direction this series took with this movie, I enjoyed The New Mutants as guilty pleasure way much more then lets say a terrible Dark Phoenix. This spin off has a potential, but needs to be updated if they want to continue with it.'"
"'Or World War S for SUCKS, STUPID DECISIONS and SYFY-ENVY.I\'m not ready to call it, but I think Covld\'s killing cinema. I hated this movie. Like unbelievably hated it. And speaking of unbelievable, this movie\'s parents, 1998\'s Deep Impact and Armageddon, had enormously better special effects and those was decades ago.Mercifully, I only spent $3.99 on this rental, which coincidentally enough, was about half its budget. Still, I overpaid for this lazy, boring, unemotional mess of two actors sleepwalking through it and a kid who\'s more bipolar than Harvey Dent.This disaster film deals with every...single...clichÃ© but done without depth. Regardless, I suppose you\'re supposed to feel for the, of course, divorced parents of a diabetic child and their boring journey to the Title because a comet is set to destroy Planet Earth!I can\'t even comprehend the plot holes, predictable actions, the annoying characters, the needless sacrifices and the most amateur filmmaking since Battlefield Earth. And it really hurts that it\'s 2 hours of blah with stars who just didn\'t give a damn and about 3 minutes of action that\'s so comically cartoonish and based in no reality, it should never be called an Action Movie despite having Gerard Butler\'s name attached.I hate to say this, but if you find one of those Bruce Willis sell-out movies where he appears for 2 minutes of screen time and gets a check for having that top billing, you\'re probably better off watching that.SKIP THIS DISASTER.'"
"'Greenland has a grand setting and engages enough, but lacks substance.The end of the world will bring anyone together, one minute it\'s awkward, the next together forever. Don\'t forget there\'s always crazies out there. It\'s like a small portion of War of the Worlds, really. At the start with the other families at their get together, everyone there knows they\'re the only ones selected. I don\'t believe them going to check for a second, leaving the Garrity\'s to pack, so they can then react, very convenient. Would have been much tougher had they not voluntarily left the house and had to pack with them there. I don\'t understand the anger though, seems like a civilized conversation. They know his profession and why\'s he\'s been selected, he didn\'t have a say, seems petty. The characterization\'s rather thin and performances not particularly memorable, but it\'s alright.'"
"It's been a while since I've seen a good comet disaster movie, so I was looking forward to 'Greenland'.Fortunately, 'Greenland' did not disappoint. The film is not as action-packed as 'Armageddon', since it focused more on the drama surrounding the disaster. The film also illustrated people's behavior during disaster, and the dire consequences of their actions, and humanity's inability to work together when disaster strikes.Within the first few minutes the film hit us with an overdone cliche: a disaster movie featuring yet another couple with marital problems who will - no doubt - be reunited due to the disaster. Fortunately, the rest of the film was not as cliched and a great depiction of human greed and selfishness.The suspense is elevated by our hero, John's son Nathan, who is diabetic. John and his wife, Allison, and son has been selected to be taken to an underground shelter. However, just before boarding the plane, Nathan forgets his insulin in the car. This sets off a series of events that throws their lives - and chances of survival - into turmoil. Thanks to good performances, this film felt realistic, and there's some excellent scenes of comet debris crashing to earth. 'Greenland' is an easy watch with a simple premise and no surprise twists.And who is to say this can't - or won't - happen?Would I watch it again? Possibly."
"A group of terrorists take over a flight, unaware that a mother, travelling with her son, is a vampire and will do all that is necessary to protect him.This starts off quite well during the initial hijacking when the film is geared around the terrorists and the vampire sneaking around the plane taking them out. Things get a touch OTT when people start getting bitten and in turn becomes vampires. This is ok fun with buckets of blood, but it's too long, the kid is annoying and the frequent flashbacks showing how the woman became a vampire rather a dull diversion and quite unnecessary. Ok, sort of."
"I tried to watch it all the way through, but I got the gist of it within ten minutes. The story is lacking any sort of purpose other than blood and gore. The characters are flat, undeveloped and with no direction. This is basically a copy cat movie of all those other movies where you have either an elevator, island, a boat or a building with infected people getting killed off one at a time. It's completely predictable and boring."
"Oh dear. Despite reshoots and a huge amount of publicity here in the UK, the negative reviews kept coming for this film. And sadly in my opinion they are deserved.I'm not saying that the Rex Harrison original, or the Eddie Murphy films based on 'Dr Doolittle' were such classics that the character should be retired, but surely they could've done better than this.I didn't mind Robert D.J, I thought he was good, I didn't mind the Welsh accent, or even the overcomplicated story.What lets this film down is that despite copying the Eddie Murphy films example of having funny people do the animals voices, they get people who aren't funny. Either that or the script doesn't allow them to be.Worst of the bunch by a mile has to be Kumail Nanjiani, who keeps getting these voice over sidekick roles (he also did MiB International) and is about as funny as he was there - not very.This film didn't deserve the kicking it deserved, but it should've been a lot better than it is."
"'Dolittle is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a physician who has the ability of talking to animals going on a new adventure to find a legendary island with the help of his crew and a young boy.I enjoyed watching this movie but I believe that it didn\'t reach its potential or I had high expectations from it. I liked the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. who played as Dr. John Dolittle and it was something extremely different than his previous roles. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Harry Collett\'s who played as Tommy Stubbins and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by Stephen Gaghan it was interesting but nothing more than this.Finally, I have to say that Dolittle is a good average movie to spend your time with but don\'t have high expectations from it because you are going to be let down by it.'"

As turnout, this film is about George committed a series of crime, and eventually kill by the joined spirit of his wife, and the spirit in his house! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the taking bath scene, overuse of the vomit scene, overuse of the sleeping scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, and overuse of the smoking scene!

'2 out of 5 stars.Boring horror thriller film. Which the plot is boring and forgettable. Cast ensemble gave a tedious performance. Lacks thrills and horror. And the ending was a wtf moment that left you with no other thought about the movie.'
"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. It takes place entirely in the Mariana Trench, almost 7 miles deep and with water pressures of over 15,000 psi. Why would a crew be down there? To explore for oil, of course. The opening scene which summarizes all the risks pretty well summarizes what the movie is.The story doesn't try to explain anything about the undersea operation, shortly after the movie begins an Earthquake begins to cause cracks in the structure and the whole movie in essence is an escape saga, to see if the core group of 6 or 8 can scramble to safety.It is of course mostly improbable but as a horror B-movie is suitably entertaining. However not the type of movie I'd like to see again.An additional note, the soundtrack is a character in itself, containing much very deep bass, so anyone watching it at home must have a good sound system with a powered subwoofer to get full impact and enjoyment. I replayed a couple of scenes with only my TV speakers on and all the great sound disappeared. It is a dramatic difference."
"'UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another underwater base flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it\'s a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can\'t make out what\'s going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they\'re really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I\'m a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER\'s okay, but you\'d be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie.'"

"'(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Croods is a pretty fair family adventure film. Following the Croods next adventure as they are trying to find there forever tomorrow home which they call it. But when they come across a giant walled utopia. With food everywhere. And an oasis river. They run into another family that calls themselves the Bettermans family. Which they know Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) family before they passed away. The Bettermans try to have Guy fall for there daughter while Grug (Nicholas Cage) makes a deal with them since he is disliking the idea his daughter Eve wants to start a life with Guy. While the Bettermans are holding a secret about there perfect home.The plot is pretty decent. The Croods are living a different lifestyle with the Bettermans. While they are trying to handle the Croods lifestyle. Grug is having trouble letting go his daughter is growing up. The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good. The direction with Croods mother and Eve and grandmother teaming with Bettermans mother and daughter to go save the guys was a little cheesy as it tries for that punk rock star tone. The humor is fun. The animation is colorful. And plenty of adventurous action.'"
"Russo Brothers trying out new stuff after the MCU. The story is about the life of Cherry: his love life, military life, post-military life, and his demise.The first part of the movie was the weakest. It was loaded with voice over, breaking the fourth wall, and other styles that was meant to engage the audience. Even though I didn't mind them really much, I agreed that these stylistic choices were just there for the sake of substances. They didn't do much to enhance the meaning or themes of the movie.However, the second and third arcs became significantly better. They showed Cherry's life in the military and his use of drugs. Even though the plot type was done countless times before, I thought the Russo's brothers' execution was great. The third arc had a big Requiem for a Dream vibe, and it was pretty hard for me to watch some of the scenes.Tom Holland was marvelous at his role and he sold his character very well. At around the second and third arcs, he became much more serious and this is where he shined the most.Even though the movie was almost 2.5 hours, I didn't feel it was too long and I was hooked into the story. However, I wouldn't watch the movie again because of the length.Overall, an entertaining yet bit rough to watch at times. Quite a roller coaster. 8.5/10"
"'Andy (Charlize Theron) short for Andromeda, the Andromeda leads a group of near immortals on select missions to save lives and eat baklava.

Copley suspects the groups power and want to turn them over to Merrick Pharma. Rather than approach them with a proposal, he opts to gun them all down and make up later. This scenario didn\'t make any sense at all.This looks like a two hour pilot for a series that promises to be better. And they have the ability to drop people out and bring new ones in.Guide: F-word.

"The third and final installment, here we get to learn how and why Sarah Fier came to be.It's a pretty good film, good to see members of the cast mixed up, and given something better to do. Better than the first, perhaps not as good as the second. It's a worthy conclusion, and gives us lots of answers.Some great production values here, great buildings, and some fantastic costumes.One gripe I have here, the shocking accents, it was hard to tell if they were trying to be Irish, Canadian or something a little more obscure.Perhaps the single best scene of the three movies comes here, the moment of terror inside the church with The Pastor, it was incredibly macabre and unnerving, it certainly did shock.Enjoyed it, 7/10."

"'The first thing I want to write is - unless you watched and enjoyed the prior Bill and Ted movies then you really ought to skip this one. While it is silly and juvenile it is done in such a winning manner that it is totally enjoyable.The first Bill and Ted movie came out in 1989 when the two were in their 20s but acting like high schoolers. Now mature in their 50s they each have a 20-something child, daughters, who identify with their dads and get into the time travel mode to help save the world yet again.I enjoyed it, on DVD from my public library. My wife skipped, as I suspected she would.'"
"This was an awful attempt to sequelise a franchise that had run its course in the early 1990s. I mean, it's nice to see Winter and Reeves in their iconic roles after all these years, but time hasn't been kind to this series and Reeves in particular seems awkward and uncomfortable. If they're cringeworthy, so too are the new cast members: hip young females who embarrass throughout, particularly the actress playing Reeves' daughter whose acting is pure caricature rather than performance. The rest is an overload of cheap CGI, story elements borrowed from the earlier films, and a random ending. Poor show indeed."
"It's 1939 Suffolk, England. Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires local archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to dig some mysterious mounts of earth on her property. He sees the potential for an unprecedented Anglo-Saxon find. When he makes a big discovery, prominent archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives to take over the dig. He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine."
"Based on a true story, Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes ) is hired by Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to do an archeological dig on some hills of dirt near her home. Edith is ill and has a son Robert who wants to help.If you read the by-line you know what they discover. They create a little drama around it. But hey, it is all about folks digging in dirt. I can't believe they did this film without Keira Knightley.Guide: Brief sex. No swearing or nudity."
"My ratings are not objective. This movie is objectively fine. My ratings are subjective opinions. My opinion is this is one of the most boring movies ever.There is about 30 minutes worth of story in this 2 hour movie. Say another 30 minutes for character development. The rest is nothingness. I almost quit a bunch of times. I watched it on fast speed, at most 2x during scenes with talking. But other times i had it at 5x speed and didn't miss a thing. That's how nothing this movie is.

"'You\'d get an ordinary movie seems to be the answer. It\'s certainly an odd reference to Superman--perhaps the strangest since DC\'s most beloved family farmers unexpectedly seemed to turn up in the Marvel movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). Seems weirder to me than even Brightburn (2019). That what appears to be the most remarkable thing about a production is that it casts the same duo, Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who played Superman\'s adoptive parents in the latest DC cinematic incarnations, Man of Steel (2013) and so on, is an indication that not much interesting is going on here. It also seems perhaps inadvertently in poor taste that the son this time dies from falling off a horse, as I couldn\'t help but recall the similar tragedy that paralyzed the late Christopher Reeve, who of course also played Superman at one time.Supermans aside, though, Let Him Go is a simple neo-Western revenge tale where the Kents--I mean, Blackledges set out to rescue their grandson after his abusive stepfather scuttles him and his mother off to North Dakota. Well acted, well plotted, scenic, and that\'s about it. There just isn\'t much going on in this superficial The Searchers (1956) retread--even if it is a period piece that covers issues of domestic abuse and mistreatment of Native Americans. Leslie Manville evidently relishing her role as the baddie is the highlight.'"
"LET HIM GO (2020) ***1/2 Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lesley Manville, Kayli Carter, Booboo Stewart, Jeffrey Donovan. Still waters run deep while family matters is the crux of this lean and mean low-key slow burn drama cum Western vengeance with Costner and Lane as grandparents to a boy now with a 2nd yet shady rural family led by malevolent matriarch Manville (with her Cruella DeVille do to boot). With its smudged pallet of bruised brown and blue-greys by cinematographer Guy Godfree and a steady helm by director Thomas Bezucha - adapting Larry Watson's novel - makes a potboiler of taut tension a work of art."
"'I don\'t have anything specific i hated about this movie. It just didn\'t do anything for me. It did a bad job of getting me invested in the story or the characters. The parts that are supposed to be intense didn\'t make me feel the stakes or any kind of suspense. The longer the movie went on, the less i cared about what happens in the story or to the characters. And the action is mediocre.Actually i do have a specific complaint. So many parts of the movie are sloppy in the sense that the viewer is not sure what\'s happening in a scene. I\'m not talking about shaky-cam/quick-cut fight scenes. They just did a bad job of producing a continuous flow that a viewer can follow. And a lot of the scenes were so dark. On more than one occasion i didn\'t know who was fighting who or which character was shot. No wonder i stopped caring. Fail.I came back after finishing the review because i remembered a couple more things. Maybe i just checked out early causing me to forget. But the dialogue is atrocious. And there is an ah ha moment that makes zero sense. To keep it vague, it\'s okay if a specific person dies. But logically, it wouldn\'t make any difference based on what they\'re trying to avoid (1 viewing, 8/8/2021)'"
"I'll take it on faith from John Clancy fans that this film had very little to do with the book of the same name, except for the names of principal characters. My fault with the film is the obtuse writing and as at least one reviewer pointed out, scenes so dark you can't tell what happened in them, only to find out later in the story. It pretty much boils down to operatives in both the CIA and it's Russian counterpart attempting to foment war with the other side, for reasons not really made clear except to keep tensions among the world powers going. Soldier John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) comes to that realization when he eventually meets up with his Russian opposite Rykov (Brett Gelman), who had a much better handle on the state of affairs between their respective agencies. The story is wrapped around Kelly's need to seek vengeance for the murder of his wife (Lauren London) and unborn child, but the revenge motive tends to get buried in the confusing story line along the way. I don't think a second viewing would clear things up all that much."
"Having seen Judd Apatow's previous directed films and knowing his type of comedic humor, and after seeing the trailer of this film, had somewhat an expectation as what to expect.The King of Staten Island is quite apparently a semi autobiographical film about the upcomings of Pete Davidson's life. With that in mind, it was expected as he would deliver a great performance as this film may have a deep meaning to him.With an original intended theatrical release, this film was unfortunately slated to straight to streaming. Perhaps they could have waited several months later to release this in theaters- as it would have don't more justice.As a film, very solid doses of comedy and drama which Apatow is always great at. There are many light hearted funny scenes, but also sad and touching scenes. There is a good balance. And as a story there are enough little subplots to keep engaged all the way though start to finish.This is the film which may be responsible for Pete Davidson becoming a star, although with its limited release the question still remains. Perhaps in 2-3 years from now we will have our answer."
"The Babysitter: Killer Queen: Two years after his clash with the Satanic Cult, Cole (Judah Lewis) is in High School. No one believes his tales of that night, Melanie (Emily Alyn Lind), wisely keeps quiet about the whole thing. Cole has to see the school therapist/nurse and his parents want to send him to a special school. His complicated relationship with Melanie continues, she now has a boyfriend, Jimmy (Maximilian Acevedo), but still invites Cole along to a lake party on Jimmy's uncles's boat. A new Satanic Cult emerges and along with the resurrected old team sacrifice a victim. Cole escapes from their clutches with the help of Pheobe (Jenny Ortega), a new bad ass girl in his class who has an Alice In Wonderland fixation. You get death by decapitation,real flamethrower, homemade flamethrower, boat hook, machete. There are some good in references to Cape Fear, Deliverance etc. Very much a slapstick comedy horror but there are some dark moments. Not up to the standard of the original (maybe too many wacky characters) but we get the origin stories of the original Cult and it's certainly worth watching. Directed and Co-Written by McG. On Netflix. 6/10."
"A sequel to the largely average film that nobody asked for, KILLER QUEEN sees the geeky hero from THE BABYSITTER once more subjected to the machinations of the members of a Satanic cult with bloodshed and murder in mind. It's an action-oriented narrative with tongue firmly in cheek, packed full of pop culture references and jokes and very little more besides. The characters are bland and one-dimensional, the jokes scatological, and the OTT death sequences surprisingly repetitive and tiresome, with every cast member seemingly getting a bucket of blood chucked in their face at some point in the movie."
"Yes, we see on the news, infrequently, rage for whatever reason leading to someone going on a killing rampage. The problem is that this script/movie does what many do which shows a character (unfortunately usually female) unrealistically making no or poor decisions in order to make 90 min. of film violence.\nNear the beginning our lead character is being followed & harassed and she stops at a gas/market station where the attendant is told of potential danger from the driver of the vehicle now also parked in front. The pursuer even tries to run over a man at the station. Neither the attendant nor our pursued female seem to have called the police; there's no indication of store security cameras being used along with traffic video. At that point I'm thinking it's a not too real made-up script."

"'It was even worse than average. It had so may cons... First of all, it wasn\'t realistic at all. You can\'t just kill people, drive as you want and there won\'t be cops under you, come on. Another bad thing is visuals... well,when you see horror or action movie and some scenes look as fake as WWE RAW you know something is wrong with that. There are many plot holes. We still don\'t know why he killed those people at the beginning, who they were, what happened in his life that he is so unhinged. Ending was bad. Cops can\'t chase him, no one can find him and mom kills guy with scissors... That\'s HUGE No from me, I would never recommend to spend your time watching this film.'"
"Surprisingly, 'Bloodshot (2020)' isn't bad. It's sometimes genuinely enjoyable in a camp kind of way, especially in its opening moments, and it's often rather entertaining even when it isn't, for all intents and purposes, all that great. There's some decent action (as well as some not-so-decent action, of course), the performances are all pretty much on point and the narrative does a lot more than you'd expect it to. The movie has a number of generic twists and turns that are somewhat interesting in their execution and its visual effects are often rather impressive (though, again, they often aren't). Sure, the piece is cheesy and outdated, but it's actually kind of fun. However, there's always this element of mediocrity present. Even when you're entertained, you're always aware of some issue. That, along with the fact that it's only ever so good in the first place, makes for an experience that rests somewhere between 'alright' and 'good enough'. It helps that Vin Diesel is just an inherently funny human being, a bit of a walking meme. His presence definitely elevates this, even if it's difficult to put your finger on why exactly that is. Ultimately, this is a decent flick that does exactly what it needs to without taking itself too seriously. It's not great, but it's better than you'd think it would be. 6/10"
"'Unlike The Rhythm Section which was a more realistic tale of someone becoming a revenging superhero this script is straight out of comic book fantasy - no real here. We have a blood stream filled not with blood, but little alien looking nano spiders busily repairing every mishap, i.e. get an arm blown off; within seconds they have made you a new one (forget where all the minerals/calcium for bone, and organic materials for muscle, nerves, etc. came from). The usual formula bad/mad industrialist scientist out to make a load of money & sell his little nano buddies to the highest bidder. Worth eight stars only because the script was a little different & the CGI was fairly decent (although the now decade old grayish swirling stuff is still the main CGI du jour).'"
"'Bloodshot is a poor collection of Universal Soldier, Robcop, Matrix and \'Memento, among other films, that do not work well.

'3 out of 5 stars.Oxygen is a fair science fiction thriller film about Liz (Melanie Laurent) who wakes up in a cryo pod with no memory. No idea how she got there. And a defective pod that is limited on oxygen. While she tries to discover how she got there. And how she can escape it.What worked? The plot is decent which tried to keep a mystery. It gives a brief backstory on Liz. And some brief moments of the events that is happening before she got in the pod. There is a twist which was pretty neat. And shocking.Melanie Laurent did a good job with her performance.The music score was okay. Its claustrophobic direction was good.What did not work?The film was short with where it went. Spending the whole movie in a cryo pod. Which did get boring after a while. And it did get slow which was being short on thrills.'
"If your willing to take a part viewing the world in different angle from a car seat then do it. if you are willing to torture your already exhausted brain then do it. if your willing to enter a metaphysical to be or not to be philosophical journey into nothingness then do it. if you are used to fall asleep when driving your car longer the 2 hours then dont.this film is for the feinschmaecker intelligencia, made for the stern and cultural reviewers to tear to pieces and then put it all together again in the eternal search of,'' what was this all about''??i give it a five for the acting and a very diverse filmography, the sound of music do leave a sense of cold uncertainty, and the rest were far too haiflaiing for the grumpy old man. its not a rewind."
"Although I was intrigued and interested by the whole story during the entire movie I can't say it is a good movie. It's much too confusing, you hope to get answers that you will never get and that's just not my idea of a good movie. It's just frustrating, certainly when you spend more than two hours trying to figure out what it's all about. That said if the story would have been explained correctly it could have been a good movie. The acting was really good, especially from Toni Collette which was my favorite. she has a smaller part but it reminded me of her character she played in the excellent series United States Of Tara. So it were not the actors that failed in this movie but the story and that's too bad because it had potential. I won't say I didn't enjoy most of the movie but for me there is a rule that a story has to be clear towards the end which is absolutely not the case here. I'm still wondering what I watched and probably never will get it."
"'Avoid. Why? Because I felt uncomfortable, bored, confused, dumbfounded and in the end irritated. Who wants to feel that when watching a movie? You do? I do not.This movie is like almost all the other Charlie Kaufman movies: I do tend to feel incredibley UNcomfortable and confused and DEpressed and IRritated. Sometimes feeling miserable while watching a movie can be rewarding IF (and only if) the movie is really great, but it isnt...Not any good? I applaud Charlie Kaufman for trying. These kind of movies rarely get made and they are quite unique.Conclusion: I would recommend anyone unfamiliar with Charlie Kaufman to watch Adaptation instead of this incoherent story. Adaptation presented discomfort, emptiness, anxiety and depression in a really funny and sparkling way to watch. This movie however was too long winding and boring to stay interesting...'"
The story gets increasingly more bizarre. There are no explanations or closures either. I honestly don't know what I watched.
"Female assassin on the run, history of brutal kills, ex military, etc...the list goes on n there r many similar movies. But when u make a movie on a bad ass female assassin pls dont put family melodrama n cliches aft cliches. The hand to hand combat is not choreographed well, the film is devoid of tension n suspense n the worst is the piece of cake assasination plan.\nJessica Chastain aint convincing as an assassin.\nAs a fan of Colin Farrell, i got disappointed. Well, he is in good shape but the footage is very less.\nSo ther is a scene wher the character of Chastain is narrating her alcohol abuse n childhood stuff in a group therapy and jus when poor Tony's turn came to share, the camera cut off, how selfish man.\nGena Davis played an assassin in Long Kiss Goodnight n sad to see her in bad condition, very old n with those plastic surgery lips.\nThe woman who played Chastain's sis (she was ther in Teeth n It) has a very chubby face n poor ol John Malkovich talking as if he is wheezing but he does get to kick some ass."
'It is not funny at all. I was bored out of my mind. The plot is silly and contrived. The only thing good is the beautiful costumes of the three princesses.'
"This 2020 thriller tells about a female author/historian, Veronica (Janelle Monae) who finds herself experiencing traumatizing, racial slavery and tries to\nsolve a way to escape. This isn't bad, but could've been better in my opinion.\nI like the score, Monae does a decent job and she's cute reminding me a bit of Kerry Washington (Django Unchained). The film has some dramatic, violent and tense moments. Give it a try only if you're into psychological thrillers or dramas."
"While it is marketed as Train to Busan 2 and generally the promotion, I reckon especially internationally, tries to enamour people to watch this, it does a bit of a disservice to the movie. Yes this is losely connected to Train to Busan, as it plays years after that event (mostly). But it is not the same movie and it does not pander and just rehashes what the first one was. This is more of an action adventure with zombies. And some pathos and (melo)drama thrown in for good (or bad) measure.Not everything is great here of course and if you'd ask me which of the two movies I liked better, I'd go with the first one. Still and even though this has its flaws, it is more than entertaining. If you let yourself enjoy it and don't compare it too much or let some drama ruin it. Especially the ending may really make some people at least annoyed. Predictable as it is, it looks and sounds good and is the zombie ride anyone who doesn't mind some explicit gun violence on their screens."
"Surprisingly good even for the overcooked zombie genre. Zombies were numerous; nicely cosmetically zombized with well chosen stunt zombies for expressions & contortions. Additional fight scenes between boring humans added spice to zombie meal. Car chase & zombie mowing added a nice flavorful topping to this movie meal. A few plot twists to keep us guessing. All with some, perhaps humorously, unlikely characterizations. CGI not the best, but good enough unless you're a picky eater."
"I agree with those who feel cheated because this film lacks the effort to show us the personalities of those who made movies in the golden days. Mankiewicz is so random and so troubled that I couldn't get a real direction. From word one I had trouble feeling any sympathy for this man. Gary Oldman is startlingly good, but the direction and writing put him on the stage alone. I would love to have gotten to know a bit more about the other characters from Thalberg to Hearst. I really looked forward to seeing this and sadly will not watch it agaain."
"'The Call was a fine Korean thriller that had some very good concept and idea but i felt also like that idea could be explored and used in a little better ways then it was.Characters were little uninteresting to and i wasnt able to connect with them but they had some fine conversations over phone in beginning when they were more friendly and towards middle when staff started to change a bit and film turned into a horror.Story was like i said very unique and cool and im not sure if we ever seen something similiar on paper ,but execution was to messy to make it work'"
"You have to see this, the flick on flix, wow, what the hell was all that people were talking about. And by know I promised myself never to watch a trailer and go blind into a flick. As I did with this one.The only thing I heard that you needed to se eit for the effects used. And I agree, the effects used here and there are indeed way above mediocre but effects doesn't make a movie as we see here. The story I can dig but why o why does flicks have to clock in over 90 minutes nowadays.By now you do know I wans't into The Call. A lot of blah blah over the, sigh, phone and nothing really happening. Sure, there is blood here and there and some awkward situations with some devilsih doing but overall it was a let down for me. Hyped again by Netflix and by a lot of people on all social media, do not count me in.\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 3/5\nStory 2,5/5\nComedy 0/5"
"As with most 'time-travel' movies, 'Call (2020)' asks you to take quite a few leaps of logic as it progresses towards its increasingly complex finale. However, if you accept the fact that its two timelines are, essentially, occurring concurrently, most of its narrative (sans one or two mostly harmless inconsistencies) makes perfect sense - or, at the very least, its issues are so small that they can safely be hand-waved away with no detrimental effect. The picture's most, I suppose, iffy moments come during a final, mid-credits interlude that seeks (successfully, I'll add) to insert one last sting into the thing's tail. Although this segment arguably isn't necessary and runs the risk of souring one's final impression, it does what it sets out to - for better or worse - without ruining anything it proceeds. That's all I'll say about the plot, let alone the ending, as I don't want to spoil any aspects of the generally unpredictable affair. It's fantastically subversive, side-stepping expectation in natural and genuinely interesting ways. As a result, it often has you on the edge of your seat. It's a brilliant thriller that builds upon its initial premise almost perfectly. It does eventually threaten to cross the line of credibility and become too much for its own good. It never does, though, and remains a thoroughly engaging, almost captivating experience throughout. It really is great. 8/10"
"'Honest Thief was somewhat better film from the rest of recent Liam Neeson films but it still had that same vibe through its runtime and it also had predictable plot and only fine action.Honestly i dont know why this guy makes this kind of films,he proved in Schindlers list that he has a great range as a actor and he proved that he can play a dramatic roles very easily,so why in the hell he continues to pick weak and predictable action and thriller films that feel all the same and that offered nothing new its genre or something revolutionary to Liams carrere,Honest Thief was a little better film then recent his his but still it is one them same'"
"The headline says it all. It's a mediocre premise with mediocre execution and a bunch of stupid parts and things that make no sense. At least it was fun to see a movie with kyle reese, T-1000, michael weston and zeus. And i'm happy that jeffrey donavan is getting movies roles. I've been saying he should ever since he showed off his wide acting range in burn notice (1 viewing, 6/2/2021)"
"'The film opens hinting at gremlins as Maude Garrett (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz) forges her way on board an airplane at Aukland Air Base, NZ in 1943. She has a package that is classified and can not be opened and must remain up right. She ends up riding in the lower turret where it is cold and has a gremlin. For the first 52 minutes the film consists of ChloÃ« Grace Moretz talking to the vulgar crew on the radio. This was the good part. Then the film becomes over the top (without William Shatner) as if Asylum was making the film using a lot of very bad green screen. They completely ruined the film. Holding on with one finger?Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
"'This was so many types of genres that ive lost count, and from radiotheatrical to actional to reactional in a 3 step kind of build up + the gremlins of course.so now we all know what can turn a woman into a devil... its easy, just threaten her baby and youll be barely clinging on to life if youre lÃ¸cky.but most of all a surprising twisted waraction movie of a waiting game the first half, with lots of mediocre radio chattering female dividending gossip at the fence, the second half is just completely supernatjural at all levels.its a small cast, but its just cloe that gives some effort in this film, nothing extravagant, more as expected from that little lioness.production is fair and square, but total lack of story and -line. its a film that the grumpy old man barely recommends with a weak 6'"
"'So, a stowaway on a mission to Mars. Not only is the idea stupid, it\'s impossible to happen. This is as bad as the Netflix original with Hilary Swank, where the crew barely gets along on another long space mission. The writers of this pap obviously have no idea how hard Astronauts train and that getting along is part of that training. Just a terrible idea, horribly done. Take my advice, read \'The Cold Equations instead. A way better story but, avoid that adaptation as well where they try to give a morality story a happy ending.'"
"'This film start with a man Palmer riding a bus, and he back to his grandmother house scene! As turnout, this film is about an ex-convict Palmer need to adopt a boy Sam from his drug addict mom Shelly! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the playing with doll scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the brushing teeth scene, and overuse of the watching TV scene!

Another disappointed film!'"
"Load of fake accounts with reviews promoting this movie. Now with smarter fakes.This movie is really slow. It's mis-titled for starters. It should be called Sam, or Palmer and Sam, or The Crying Contest. Seriously, almost every character cries and wants the title.Overall this is a predictable story, troubled child and on and on, not much happens really, and the ending, well, just sort of ends. I guess that's what they call a movie these days.I like JT, but he's downright cringey in this in his multiple attempts to force himself to cry. 3 stars for his performance, not much else is good or worth watching. It's not realistic, multiple inconsistencies, and the fact that JT wants to take care of a kid he only knew for a few days, on a $60/day job, with no savings, and no where to live. Well, that's just rubbish."
"Once upon a time, the world was filled with magic but scientific conveniences eventually replaced magic. In the modern world, elf Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland) lacks confidence, turning 16, and pines for his dead father whom he never met. His brash older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) is obsessed with the old forgotten magic. One day, their mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) finds an old magic staff of their father. Ian uses it to bring back his father but he's only half successful.This could be counted as a failure when compared to the standard exceptional Pixar levels. It just doesn't have that usual Pixar MAGIC. Firstly, the movie should not have started with a magical world introduction. We want to discover it along with the characters, not wait for them to catch up with us. Secondly, the emotional button needs to get hit a lot harder. Up devastated the audience in the first five minutes. This movie needs that so the ending can punch even harder. Quite frankly, the material is in the movie already. It doesn't quite have the power. Thirdly, the half father is weird visually. Without the top, it feels everybody is looking at his crotch. There has to be a better way. Weekend at Bernie's would be a better idea. This is a step down from my Pixar expectations."

"'Fantasy Island is an Adventure - Fantasy movie in which we watch five people arriving at a luxurious island where everything is possible. The owner and operator of the fantasy island states that every person has only one fantasy that can be made true so, each person decides its dream or fantasy and starts living it.I did not like the movie because it was boring and full of unnecessary plot twists which were predictable and made the movie even more boring. At first the theme was interesting but after half an hour everything change and became boring and predictable due to poorly execution. The direction which was made by Jeff Wadlow was not the best but I believe he did everything he could in order for it to become better, although nothing changed. Finally, I have to say that Fantasy Island is not a good movie for all the reasons I stated above and I believe that even if you do not have high expectations from it you will be disappointed and you will think that you wasted your time watching it.'"
"Not the worst what I've seen this year but it's pretty bad. Too many plot jumps, there are no logic in some episodes. Fantasy Island more like Disaster movie. 4/10 wouldn't recommend to watch it."

"5 people arrive by seaplane to pursue 4 fantasies on Fantasy Island, under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke. The fantasies all seem relatively straightforward - one wants to be a hero soldier like his late father, one wants to correct the worst mistake she ever made, two brothers just want to have a hedonistic millionaires fun weekend, and one wants revenge on a school bully. What could possibly go wrong? Well, the opening sequence where a terrified woman is chased and caught is a clue, as is the fact that the UK Censor's card reveals that the film's full title is Blumhouse's Fantasy Island, Blumhouse being a horror production house.So,the old TV series reimagined as a horror. It's not a bad idea, and the 4 tales here (and the wider story they become part of) are nicely contrived and ravelled together.The cast is decent, with Michael Pena doing well as Mr Roarke. The production values all show on screen, and the film resolves well, with a very welcome kicker at the very end.This was pretty good."
"When it comes down to it, in the end we are alone, even while Alive (which is the actual english title of the movie). Even if there are others around you (zombies or otherwise), you can only count on yourself. Well unless ... although can you even trust yourself? And maybe you can trust others? Maybe not though ... this movie is more on the tension side than on the action side of it.You will still see blood and violence, just don't expect this to be something it isn't. Having said that, this may very well be an accurate version of what would happen in a very densely populated area ... and how some people would react to it. Not just our main character. If that sounds good to you, give it a shot (no pun intended, especially because there aren't that many weapons to begin with) ..."
"Zombies are supposed to be the living dead, but zombies have been so abused and misused that the fad is gone. Zombies are dead so stop beating them.This Korean zombie movie is no different than any other movie ever produced. It is a guy locked up in his apartment playing online games to find out through the news that a dust cloud has come in to the city and is causing people to turn in to zombies.So if it is a dust cloud, why are so few people getting infected when they are running through the streets? you would expect 99% of the population to become infected instantly. And why do people think that humans are some sort of awesome predator with out weapons? We don't have claws, we don't have sharp teeth. Have you ever tried to eat a raw steak? It's nearly impossible unless you cut it up in to very tiny pieces to make it easier to chew.Zombies are worthless and these movies are boring. Please stop making them."
"'#Alive' finds drama and tension within one man's apocalyptic imprisonment while zombies are largely kept locked outside, only posing a threat while society crumbles and we become our worst enemies."
"'Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the all falls apart felt forced and wasn\'t necessary.'"
"On sugar pills entertainment, but its a flippy floppy quality technical production, with lots of incoherence and a more bold than perfect on the plain things that makes a film a ''good'' film. there are big flaws in the sound production, and the use of score with a volume button turning up and down each time there are dialouges are cheap and unescesarry. the sound management has forgotten how much noise a moving ship makes. and the calmity of the calamity make the silence airpinning irritating. also the editing has its issues, and the plot dives headless back and forth.the acting are following the directors commands and very scriptous, not much freestyling here. the extras panicking do have a low standardto the positive, lots of great special effects and the fruitful light and coloration are faboulous but thats merely it, and its of course positive that the grumpy old man hung on to the end, but its a neat beacon in a rather dark pandemic season so enjoy, its recommendable entertainment."
"'One of the turn offs for this production is the pill. Watching some one have to not only swallow the pill, but turn it? then it makes a sound? And it looks like there is a tiny galaxy inside it? Talk about ruining the mood. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.There is nothing wrong with the acting, the casting is good, the cinematography too. The special effects are hit or miss, some are awesome, some are terrible. The script is off as well the directing.The idea of stealing some essence from a person and then using it to make juice to give temporary super powers is nothing new. Bad Boys for example, on Amazon already has this but it isn\'t in pill form. There are other stories with the same premise. So no kudos on originality.Other than this, it was worth a one time watch. However, this isn\'t going to win any awards. There is nothing special about this movie.'"
"The cinematography throughout this movie was quite beautiful, with the landscapes and the cgi on the animals. The characters were well acted and well scripted, but they had no depth. I didn't find myself very emotionally invested in the story. It was a decent movie in all aspects, it just wasn't too much of anything which left it a bit underwhelming."
"'The Trolls are back ... in village/town. And if you got a song reference there, you might be the right recipient and the right one to watch the sequel here. It has been a while since I saw the first Trolls movie, but I would say these work independently. That being said, I did rememeber the character and who spoke them.But as with every good sequel (or I reckon every sequel for that matter), you get a lot of new character thrown in the mix here. The movie had the bad luck (as many others) of having to be released in a year that we got hit with a pandemic - hello future readers! So it might have been quite more succesful and more on the radar of many more people.The story is quite simple and predictable. It is the songs and the voice cast that really carry the movie along. It is more than fun ... just go with the flow ... or even sing a long! More colors than you can bear probably.'"
The dialogue and story are fairly simple and straight forward. Acting is lame. Lots of teens acting and it's a teens only movie. Nothing interesting.
"'I enjoyed this film. However I might have struggled to follow the storyline without the subtitles as it is multi- lingual from Korean, English, French, fillipino, Chinese & Russian. This would be to appeal a worldwide audience and also perhaps appease the investors. It is an ambitious feat.The special effects were decent and I loved the interaction & chemistry between the cast. The child actor is so charming and the bunch of misfits ensue there is a slap stick humour. The action scenes were interesting. This is a dystopian film whereupon hope for humanity lies upon a child.It even has a star wars type fighting. The ending is uplifting...'"
"As a massive fan of South Korean cinema I was looking forward to this one and tried really hard to like it, but in the end it does come across as very bland. I'm not sure if Netflix trod on the Koreans and forced them to make this accessible to an international audience but it feels extremely generic and lightweight, like a carbon copy of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY or something. I watch Korean stuff to see Korean style and the usual quirkiness, not something that could have been churned out on a production line by Hollywood. Sure, the characters are likeable enough, but the rescue story is extremely basic and doesn't sustain the near two and a half hour running time, so this feels like it goes on forever. The CGI effects are nondescript and the cheesiness becomes all too apparent as it goes on, particularly in the ridiculous ending. Not an awful film, but a disappointment given what Korea's usually capable of."
"Predictability doesn't have to be a sin when it comes to the often paint-by-the-numbers world of romantic comedy, but this awkward combination of expectation and disdain for it make for a film only fleetingly worthy of celebration."
"'Everything that we\'ve ever seen in romantic comedies featuring protagonists who hit it off as friends-(with-non-sexual)-benefits and later fall in love (aw!), is packaged in the form of a perfunctory cliche in \'Holidate\'. The film is so by-the-numbers that you can keep your eyes closed, randomly name the leads X & Y, and it\'d all end up exactly the way you expect. No real surprises in the screenplay (by Tiffany Paulsen) - it\'s a ragbag of I\'ve-seen-that-befores, oozing cheese and gloss. The leads, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey, look great but they play stock characters that only appear in dreary, easy-on-the-brain rom-coms. The humor is the biggest letdown here: the only time I even chuckled was when a mother of two explains who a wh*re is, to her kids.'"
"I don't really know what gives a movie a cinematic feel. But i'm so sick of the straight-to-dvd feel that so many of these movies have. This seems to be the case with anything made by netflix. Just because a movie doesn't go to theaters, does that mean it's not allowed to feel cinematic? Maybe there's a rule i'm not aware of.This movie is below average in basically every area. Writing, story, comedy and general entertainment are all lacking. It's not horrible, but not worth my time (1 viewing, 4/13/2021)"

"An amateur and seasoned writer came up with a nonsense convoluted mess of a screenplay with plot and technical issues galore. I think this film lost it's way trying to be a mismash of a parody-action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above. Had it chosen one or two points of genre, it could've so been much better. Even the action was lackluster. The best part of this film was the soundtrack. Great to see an all star cast having fun though."
"It is the year 2049 and a disaster has devastated the Earth. An isolated observatory in the Arctic Circle is staffed by one, terminally-ill, scientist. He is determined to contact any off-planet travellers from Earth to warn them of the disaster and see if they can help. Little does he know but he has company.Directed by and starring George Clooney, this film had heaps of potential: the intrigue around the disaster, the scientist trying to get help, the crew of the space craft and their adventures. Clooney initially builds an interesting plot with some engaging characters.However, he doesn't know what to do with this solid foundation. Things get drawn out in the middle section - quite a few scenes that were unnecessary and just padding.There's still a chance that the film will go somewhere special but, unfortunately, it doesn't. The ending is quite the damp squib: largely predictable and unprofound.Disappointing."
"OK. What happened. This movie's first half is really engaging. As Augustine and the little girl make their way to transmitting station, it works very well. The bond that develops is sweet and yet terrifying. What happens next plays fast and loose with the first part. I wish we had some idea what happened to the earth. Then there's that space ship heading home and lots of superfluous stuff. Very slow but not really introspective. I'm disappointed in this."
"Jack Cunnigham (Ben Affleck) works construction and loves canned drinks, perhaps too much. He was a basketball player who has been asked to come back to high school and coach. We watch him swear at the kids and drink. He has anger and sorrow over a lost son and now a separated wife seeing a rich guy. The characters were not that great and we wait for the moment he realizes he has an alcohol problem and turns his life around. The event happens with 12 minutes of film left and doesn't do the film justice.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) is an alcoholic construction worker separated from his wife Angela (Janina Gavankar) after a devastating tragedy. He is convinced to coach his alma mater Catholic high school Bishop Hayes basketball team. It's the site of his greatest glory where he threw away his potential and started a descent into addiction.As a sports underdog story, this is very standard and straight forward. The most non-standard aspect of that happens at the end when it stops short. It's also very stripped down. The kids would normally get more screen time. Only one kid gets a functional character progression. Mostly, this is compelling for Ben Affleck playing a struggling alcoholic and director Gavin O'Connor trying to strip him down to the studs. My only complaint about his part is that he needs to show his self-destructiveness more overtly in the beginning. He should start in a bad place and then recover over the movie until he starts backsliding. It doesn't need to be a mystery."
"'Story is typical the kind. When I saw the casts, I really expecting more but the point of laugh just so low and lame. Super disappointing.'"
"I agree not the best comedy action movie out there but guardians of the galaxy and bad boys are extremely rare movies !! This had a few laughs, some decent special effects and a ok story. Like I said it was decent in no means a 1. People give those piece of crap garbage found FOOTAGE films ( glorified home movies) better rating than this and found FOOTAGE movies are complete and utter garbage!! Watch this with the understanding that's it just a 5 and you'll enjoy it."
"Here is a nice little story about a woman going to meet her girlfriend's parents for the first time without knowing if they will approve of the relationship or not. It was mostly entertaining, even though the girlfriend made so many outrageous choices that a real person would probably easily avoid. It kept my interest, but I didn't really feel the emotion between the two leads. It was a lukewarm romance at best. But generating onscreen passion wasn't really the point. It was about whether this woman would be willing to stay with someone who wasn't being true to herself or their feelings for one another. There was some enjoyable comedy and nice performances, but I don't see it becoming a holiday classic."
"'Poor old \'Scoob!\'. Meant to be the grand launch of a \'Hanna Barbera Cinematic Universe\' released to great fanfare, due to the pandemic it ended up being shunted to VOD, released in cinemas in some countries, in others not, before ending up on DVD, where it probably has found its actual home.This isn\'t old-school \'Scooby Doo\'. The mystery element is sidelined, making way instead for super-heroes (because there hasn\'t been enough films about them recently...), A list voice actors taking over the roles from the folks who do the straight to DVD films, and a lot of pop culture gags that probably won\'t endear the film to future generations. Daddy, who\'s Kelly Clarkson? etc.It is however an awful lot of fun, I enjoyed it far more than I anticipated, and if you can embrace this new take, then you may well enjoy it too.I hope it does end up launching a shared universe series.'"
"'This was an average adaptation of the Scooby-Doo cartoons and stories, and any fan of the franchise will recognize the story and formula. I sort of liked it but was confused by the updates. I liked the Captain Caveman cameo. The story was ok at best. My recommendation is to stick with the classic cartoons, but you might like this movie.** out of ****'"
"I love Scooby-doo but this film was a boring silly superhero movie, it started off fairly good but then went over the top & so much happens that you can tell it's the starter for a Hannah Barbara Connected Universe as we meet lots of their characters & too much silliness happens & nothing is funny or even memorable at all!!!! Really a wasted opportunity to bring our beloved Mystery Gang back but here we hardly spend any time with them as it focuses more on Mark Whailberg's Blue Falcon superhero who is so bland & boring too!!!!\nA really silly childish & very boring kids flick that may entertain very little kids but not long time fans & we get a really weird & really un-funny & un-clever part for Simon Cowell??????? Maybe funny about 12 yrs ago but is embarrassing here & so out of place but all that said it is nice & colourful & harmless fun for little"
"This wasn't bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive,racist,dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea, they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion, they could've waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie, because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing."
"'Just recently I watched a documentary about child abuse. And this fits right into this. Or fits the bill as some would say. Now it makes sense that this is also based on a true story. The actors in this are phenomenal. But I do understand people having issues with this. Starting with the already mentioned abuse. Mental and physical abuse that is. And for some maybe really tough to comprehend how someone would be that way. But there are explanations and even when others (and myself included) may think: don\'t do it, there seems now way that is helping anyone at all ... that does not take into account what the characters feels that moment. The love for ones mother can be quite big, even when others may think it is undeserved ... another similarity between this and the documentary.This then is not an easy movie to watch at all. This will put you to the test or rather your patience. Try to take this for what it is, flaws and all included. It is not so much about what you yourself would do, but what makes sense for the characters to do ... Reality is not always rosy - and this movie is about just that. The tough moments, with very few light moments in between. Be aware of that'"

"'Brining awareness to psychological problems, issues and pressure (also from society), while making an at least somewhat interesting if not entirely entertaining movie, is quite a hard task. And I\'ll admit my inner cynic had some hills to climb, some flaws to swallow, to see and not be on the pessimistic, critic side of this movie.Having said all that and while it felt that Mr Pikachu (he\'s done other movies since and before that, but bare with me or endulge my joke at least) felt like most comfortable when he was the happy go lucky guy. Not the serious brooding, thoughtful, too much in his own head Dude. Or freak as some call him. I think that quite a lot of people will be able to relate to him. Not just since the Pandemic, but generally speaking. Elle Fanning might also be best, when she can show her joyful side, but she can be sad and introvert too.This really is a warning, a social message packed into a movie. Do not take anyone for granted. Talk to each other, enjoy life if you can. Try to stay positive, but even more importantly spread that message and even if you can\'t tell by looking at a person who\'s close to you, tell them what they mean to you. Try to make the world a brighter place, so all the bright places would add up to a great/high number'"
"'Really did the writer of this screenplay, and the director simply assume its audience would be cretins? The dialogue is so pretentious and artificial that it is cringeworthy throughout.'"
"While the script is rife with monologues and exhausting rants about politics, art, and criticism, Sam Levinson's 'Malcolm & Marie' has little meaningful to say about anything. The movie starts out solid on its first 20 minutes, but then the conversation and conflict between characters just go in circles for another hour and a half. The performances are compelling, the black and white cinematography is stunning, but nothing can save this movie from its terrible writing."
"Yes Day - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Instead of heartfelt realistic execution, the director went all Tiffany Haddish or Melissa McCarthy (in her husband's movies) on the idea. Unrealistic, loud and screaming or should I say screeching kids.Jennifer Garner was the only one kept me watching this till the end. She tried her best but the rest of the cast has no energy or charm to match her.The girl playing the eldest kid, Jenna Ortega's agent must be working extra hard getting her all The most Annoying Teen parts on Netflix. First in YOU season 2, then Babysitter 2 and now Yes Day. Playing same irritating hyped up kid who is too smart and grownup for her age etc etc. we get it, you got angst.Can't believe that a movie about hour and half can get soo tedious. Kids may enjoy but parents have to suffer."
Kids fantasy transformed in a movie and I don't against the concept for relaxing once a while. But literally kids have judgement on what's right or can do? Really no! This movie tried to tell even a yes day could be a nightmare. I can't take it even when watch they behave in the movie.
"Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie. In so many other movies they would've done a whole thing about that and I kind've love that this wasn't even mentioned, it just was what it was and that's awesome. Movie is still super generic but I dig that."
"'Sadly, Poehler is perfect proof that just because someone has impeccable comic timing & style in front of the camera, that doesn\'t mean they can control it from behind the camera. This awkwardly directed & extremely predictable empowerment comedy will be meaningful to certain people, I have no doubt...especially young women. Unfortunately, the film\'s inability to choose a strong position about its protagonists (brave & important, or immature & silly?) makes it feel irresponsibly glib.'"
"This flick is just meant to be a light hearted screwball comedy and it certainly achieved that goal. The characters are indistructable as you will see during their life threatening escapades and they always come out like fresh roses.David Spade pulls off his subdued character 'Tim' perfectly. And Lauren Lapkus as 'Missy' is possitively creepy as Missy was supposed to be.A movie for 'fun to watch time', not a lmao time!"
"'Wolfwalkers: Wolfwalkers are humans who live with wolves, when their spirits leave their bodies they transform into wolves - werewolves. Set in 1650 in Kilkenny, Ireland and the woods near the town. Cromwell has occupied the area and is having the trees cut back, the wolves attack the tree cutters but the wolfwalkers try to mediate. A tale of the daughter of an English wolf hunter meeting up with a girl who is a wolfwalker. A friendship develops to the background of the occupation and the war between wolves and mankind. Beautiful, imaginative animation, the den of the wolves in a cave has rocks engraved with runes and sun wheels. A film which operates at several levels but at all times is entertaining.

"'Home invasion, but a different kind. And home being something different than what the original thought was behind the saying. Then again, while we have some cliches here, we also have certainly interesting characters. At least to a degree. Especially the female lead is very interesting (not just because of her looks), the way she acts and how she holds herself up against a male driven force.But later on in the movie she gets a bit two dimensional, almost irratically helpful. While there is an explanation to that at the end of the movie (with a twist), it does not warrant all the things she does. Good deeds never go unpunished? For whom you may ask ... and that would a valid question. But that is nitpicking and would be a bit of disservice to the movie. A movie that is visually also stunning (talking effects here) and does turn it up a notch when it comes to violence, so not for the faint of hearted. Science Fiction friends will love this ...'"
"'Sputnik: SF/Horror thriller. Echoes of Arrival as attempts are made to communicate with an Alien. This is a more vicious alien though who likes to chomp on humans, biting half their skulls off to obtain cortisol from their brains. The alien lives within a cosmonaut, emerging at night for brief periods. Set in Russia in 1983 the cosmonaut is confined at a special military base and a psychiatrist is recruited to assess the cosmonaut and to try to interface with the alien. Quite disturbing when the ET gets the munchies, some interesting plot twists. The symbiosis between alien and man is put across in a plausible manner and the creature itself is convincing. Directed by Egor Abramenko from a script by Oleg Malovichko and Andrei Zolotarev. On Netflix. 7/10.'"
'Strange plot but really not a lot to it. And some poor script writing. Might want to take some Geography classes before you write the next one.4/10.'
"'This movie is the usual government propaganda for war and destruction. But hey, they happen to deliver some vaccines. And the usual soft irony: fighting fire with fire has become fighting technological progress and preach Primitivism in a Sci-Fi context.'"
"'Some good action sequences including bots \'n\' drones and stuff, the rest is okayish. Like some reviewer quoted Buddha: expectation is the root cause of sadness, I would conclude, that if you have not much - and even better - no expectations you may kill some spare time but for certain you won\'t get something worth to remember. Outside the Wire is one of those mass products movie companies - here my theory - produce these days on assembly lines on full autopilot mode. The scripts of course are recycled, oops, written by some algorithms. Also I just wonder, do soldiers really talk all the time and that much?'"
"There is suspense and some mystery, but the ending doesn't answer any questions."
"'The Ultimate Downfall and Devastation of this New Entry in Modern-Horror is that there is Nothing New.Every Slasher and Bad-House Cliche is Relied Upon.It Comes Off like Someone\'s Uninvited Cousin.What are You Doing Here?An Oh So Familiar Story with Virtually No Twists, No Surprises, and Borrows Heavily on its Betters.A Lackluster Affair with Competent Acting, but the Story is so Lame it Feels Rusty from the Get-Go.The First-Half Absolutely Nothing Happens except some Cheating by one of the Couples.The Second-Half, the Dog Goes Missing. That\'s a Highlight.None of the Characters are that Interesting and some are Unlikable. No One Really Stands-Out. Their All just Inert, Opportunistic, and Soul-Less.The Ending is Confusing After it Ends.Nothing to Recommend to Anyone but Horror Completest.Not Worth a Watch for Anybody Else.'"
"Charlie (Dan Stevens), his girlfriend Michelle (Alison Brie), his volatile younger brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh's girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand) have rented an ocean-side house for vacation. The owner Taylor (Toby Huss) may be a racist. When Josh's dog goes missing, he suspects Taylor. A camera is discovered in the shower. It culminates in a violent confrontation.This is an indie horror directed by Dave Franco. The story is fine for a striped down horror. I would let Josh kill the man rather than engineer the death. It's meant to alleviate the guilt from him when that's not really necessary. Nobody likes him in the first place. It works a lot better if the extra element is kept off screen for awhile longer. Let the four characters cook in their own juices. The bubbling relationship between these four is the best aspect of this movie.The movie's main difficulty lies in its director. Franco lacks the specific horror action skills. Non of the kills are exciting. The horror could be much scarier. Running at the car window is probably the only good horror shot and that scene is cut short. The body on the cliff would be terrific visual if Franco could incorporate more vertigo into the shots. If you're crashing a car anyways, let's flip it for more exciting crash action. Franco doesn't have the required skills to elevate the horror thriller aspect."
"It has good production, but I can't relate to the story. The fairy creatures are not so pleasing too look at either. Can't say I enjoyed it."
"Watching Artemis Fowl is like listening to someone read a complicated instruction manual at a very quick pace, without pausing to allow for questions or reflection. I get that they had to cram a lot of story into one 90-minute movie, but it just doesn't make any sense. Artemis is unlikeable, Mulch Diggums is annoying, I felt embarrassed for Dame Judi Dench, and the rest of the cast is forgettable. If you're interested in this story, skip the movie and read the books."
"Writer Eoin Colfer noted some years ago that the film version of his Artemis Fowl books has been stuck in development hell. The producers even a cast a young boy as Artemis Fowl, a role he never got to play. Colfer said he still sees him around and he is now a grown man.Disney hired Kenneth Branagh as director to bring the film to the big screen. After all he appeared as a villain in one of the Harry Potter films and directed the first Thor movie for Marvel. Instead the film has gone to Disney' streaming channel.Young Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old Irish genius who needs to rescue his father who has been taken by a fairy. His wealthy father has been accused of stealing artefacts and the fairy wants to recover the precious Aculos.With the help of bodyguard Domovoi Butler, a dwarf and a fairy. Artemis Fowl goes off to rescue his father and comes across a magical city of fairies, trolls and dwarves.This is a fast moving action film, with good special effects but it is also rather sloppy and haphazard. I sense Branagh's finished version was gutted by the producers.Having its theatrical release delayed and then dropped in a streaming service, I doubt this will become the next Harry Potter franchise."
"'Balram (Adarsh Gourav ) climbs from village rock breaker to owning his own company, working primarily as a driver for a rich man. He does enough asides as he spouts his socialist message that excludes whites. Not as entertaining as Slumdog Millionaire nor is there any dancing. Well done but a slow moving Horatio Alger story. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.'"
"It's gross, rude and crude. It is not the kind of humour I like. Someone will like it, bit not me."
3/10 - this unbelievable Borat knockoff is frustrating (can we give Tiffany Haddish a role that isn't so stereotypical and tired?!) and remarkably unfunny (especially given the cast involved)
'Some over the top moments where you will laugh out loud but with the Jackass style and having a story it just did not flow right.'
"'This film has lots of talking, and little singing. It is about the band, and not Ma Rainey. It is not what I was expecting. I honestly found it boring.'"
'Good movie to watch for the performance from tapsee and vikrant the movie has great music but it is not a suspense movie to deal the movie is clean and clear.'
"'An American Pickle was a Seth Rogen comedy that was actually in some ways funny and it had a interesting idea and premise about it,we also know how in some films idea like this one easily fails expecely when a actor plays a two roles and they are very similiar to each other,but here Seth was able to pull it off and he give one of his best performances and he was funny in some scenes,script was also solid but it had some very poorly written lines and a predictable moments in it,An American Pickle was a watchable film,it is also one of better Seth Rogen films and i would say that you should watch a film just because of his presance'"
"'Once upon a time there was a little girl with a famous dad who made a decent film with very big movie stars that name droppers and sycophants praised to the heavens. Daddy after all was being ballyhooed for the overlong and execrable GF 3 so why not the kid? Did the US finally have its answer for Leni Riefenstahl? Nope. Seventeen years later the well budgeted banal filmography says otherwise as she returns to the crutch (Bill Murray) that started the rumor around her talent. It\'s a sorry full circle with Murray continuing the career deadpan unabated and Rashida Jones ably subbing for Scarlett in auteur Coppola\'s ongoing investigation into the older male, younger female dynamic. Murray does his aging best to keep things buoyant but as in previous works (Somewhere being the best example) Sofia\'s tedious buzz killer deadpan ambience brings on the disinterest in no time and the girl that would be Leni is once again minor Nora Ephron without the funny bone.'"
"'Laura never stands a chance to better herself as an independent individual, in the end, she is just passed from one man to another, with the symbolic watch switch, that message doesn\'t quite swim with our current tide of woman-empowerment. Sofia, being a female and a member of the Coppola Dynasty, has been wearing a Teflon armor for too long, and the father issue she tries to come to terms with is more personal and regressive than we can give its credits for. Since many other budding women directors are finally thick on the ground, perhaps it is high time that we look elsewhere for the next auteur-to-be from the distaff side.read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks'"
"Dave Bautista is stuck in a rut they keep giving him or hes taking roles that are all the same ....action comedies and with the exception of guardians they are not good!! This was worse than stuber but the same crap, poor dialogue, ok acting, bad action sequences, just a bad movie. Had maybe 2 good lines it wasn't worth watching although it was free on Amazon."
'My Spy (3 out of 5 stars).My Spy is a fair action comedy film about a CIA agent JJ (Dave Bautista) who surveillance on a lady and her daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman). Until Sophie catches them and blackmails JJ to help train her to be like him.It is a cute fun story. But the story is predictable. The film begins with JJ undercover with a Russian mob in a warehouse that ends in a firefight and chases. JJ is awkward when it comes to being a people person. He attains Sophie bring a parent or friend to school. Going on ice skating. And falling for her mother.It can be cheesy. The action sequences is decent. It does have its fair share of laughs. Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman are both good and charming with there characters.'

Entire film full of boring conversation, and overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, and overuse of the dancing on the dancing game machine scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Elle and Marco perform together at the dancing contest! At the end, Elle met Noah at the kissing booth and get back together! Elle have been accepted in both University Of California, and Harvard University application! Still have a series of bloopers scene alongside with the end credit scene! That\'s it!

"High schooler Ellie Chu is a loner in the mostly white Squamish. She is the Chinese girl who gets derisively called Chu-Chu. She and her father run the local train stop. Her father is still depressed from the lost of her mother. She sells English papers to her classmates and has a crush on popular girl Aster Flores who is dating arrogant jock Trig Carson. One day, clueless jock Paul Munsky asks for help to write a love letter to Aster. She needs $50 to keep the lights on at home and agrees to write one letter.It's Cyrano de Bergerac with a gay twist. It is sincerely sweet and a terrific addition to the Netflix YA catalogue. All three leads are compelling and nice. One roots for these characters. I would push them together faster. First I would start the Ellie-Paul friendship sooner. I do have an issue with the Paul-Aster dates. She is cheating on Trig in a small town and she can't do it in public. The better way to do it is to make Ellie and Paul friends sooner. Aster would see it and use Ellie as a go-between. The side benefit is more sweet awkwardness between Ellie and Aster like the hot spring scene. Otherwise, the dates are good but they wouldn't actually happen. In the end, this could be seen as overly sweet but there is enough sincerity for the most cynical amongst us."
"So, they jump into some unarmed vehicles is a war zone and go for a drivd, no planning or anything.. it's down hill from there. It's a shame, it had the potential to be a good movie with a few decent actors."
"'Anyone who rates this 10 Stars is clearly either IN the movie, WORKING for the movie or a complete idiot.There are so many plot screw-ups in this movie, I really don\'t even know where to begin. The story is dumb. The outcome is predictable. The acting is boring. The fight sequences are so slow and rehearsed as to remind of backyard wrestling with 15 year old kids.If you have NOTHING else to watch,... then maybe watch this, but otherwise, save yourself the frustration.4 stars,........... and that is GENEROUS.'"
"Let's not beat around the bush, this movie was ordinary - and I'm being nice. It didn't even have glimpses of brilliance. It was let down by bad direction, and bad acting by many of the cast. Though Brice Bexter did a good job for his character, it still wasn't enough to bring some quality to the movie.Apart from bad directing, it needed a solid script, and the editing could do some work. Plus the action sequences, where appalling. It never gave me a sense of danger nor stress in the situation the main characters were in. It failed to convey the uncertainty and the horrors of being in a fire fight in close quarters. The Rambo movies were more realistic compared to what this movie could muster. And Rambo movies were not that realistic.Too many flaws in the movie to mention, but you get the picture.VERDICT: Watch it if there isn't anything else available. Or maybe just take a nap instead."
"This film is terrible, really bad, yet it has the majority of voters giving it 10/10??? It's obvious that they are manufactured reviews when you watch it, it's just painfully bad."
"I was waiting for something to happen and when it eventually did, I wish I hadn't bothered. Avoid this movie at all costs. Tragic to see Andy Garcia put his name to this turkey!"

"'Bad watch, probably won\'t watch again, and can\'t recommend unless you just LOVED the original.If you loved Kurt Russell and the Elves, then you\'re in luck, because there is a LOT of them in this. It\'s literally my 2 least favorite things from the first movie.Fighting for attention, is Darby Camp and Jahzir Bruno (the two should have been the focus of the movie), and Julian Dennison (Fire Fist, from Deadpool 2) as Belsnickel.....a Christmas character I only know from The Office, and it was not a great character.Honestly, it\'s like they watched the original and were pissed Kurt Russell was outshined by a child and they determined not to allow it to happen again.All the charm and child-like wonder that makes Christmas movies special is drowned in weird action sequences and a very grumpy Kiwi.'"
"Watched the first one last year and di watch this with the family on Christmas Day itself. Very entertaining and again with a bit of singing.Kurt Russel does wel as Father Christmas. Story is okay and funny now and then espescially with the trolls or elfs, call them what you want. Normally I'm not into all those Christmas flick, one happy family and peacufull world but none of that here. One adventure to save the town of Father Christmas.Yep, I liked it.\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 3,5/5\nStory 3/5\nComedy 1/5"
"A benevolent superhero, a grounding sidekick, a villain who has a past with the hero, tons of neon-colored CGI, random time travel, a big colorful beam of MacGuffin power, and oodles of complex lore handled with little narrative interest. So it's a Marvel movie...a terrible Marvel movie. Still better than the first one though."
"Some might find the level of cruelty displayed in this movie unrealistic even for a story about a genocide but historical records prove that deep indoctrination and conditioning is in fact capable of completely desensitizing human beings and turn them into cold killing machines.The main virtue of this movie is exactly that.That other than momentarily expressed nervous reflexes there is absolutely no hesitation, no remorse, no empathy displayed by the personnel running the camp.The lesson/warning/message : a process like this doesn't run its course overnight, let's all be vigilant and recognize the signs of something like this about to take place and stop it before it's too late."
"The only good thing about this movie is that it had decent suspense and humour and acting was good enough.\nThough it's not unique as many movies like this have been made earlier, showing 3-4 guys and their stories and how their stories cross meet in between. They just added the ludo game concept in their stories to make it look different."

"'The Lovebirds (2020)' is a perfectly fine comedy focused around a couple who are drawn into a vague criminal plot that may just be the key to saving their relationship. Needless to say, it's pretty generic. It's also rather unmemorable. The plot is almost as barebones as possible when it comes to its central mystery, which never really resolves - at least, not satisfyingly - and only serves to get the focal couple from set-piece to set-piece. However, some of those set-pieces are enjoyable and everything is competently constructed. The two leads do a decent job with the banter, bickering and obviously improvised observations that comprise most of the run-time. They're not the most charismatic duo but they're easy to root for and are affable enough, making decisions that mostly make sense in-the-moment and living in a relatively grounded world. The film is intermittently chuckle-worthy and it's breezy enough, to boot. It isn't all that atmospheric or compelling, but it's entertaining enough when it gets going. There's just about enough here to adequately pass the time; just don't expect to remember it in the morning. 6/10"
I think Prabhudeva is in too hury to direct this movie I don't know what's the rush. The story of this movie is going on a speed that we can't even imagine I don't know what's the rush not even single scenerio is good. And the background music of this movie is so irritating that I could feel like my ears are gonna go deaf. In the name of Acting all the actors have done overacting. Only SONGS and the movie runtime is better than expected otherwise totally waste of time....
"Radhe was perhaps the worst decision to watch! The movie is a plain story with no turns or twist and just hyper elevate Salman Khan in a failed attempt\nIn most part of the movie, dialogues of Salman's other movies are used with additions of few more punch lines but it makes so much irritation to watch!This movie makes utter flop on box office on OTT."
"Prabhu Devaa who directed Wanted 2009 which was a remake of Telugu film Pokiri, for its sequel he remakes The Outlaws Korean film which was far better.The film adds all things that most Salman Khan films have like a forced romantic track, comedy and over the top stunts and result it's a messDirection is ok in parts but sucks overall\nMusic is ok, Zoom Zoom is best song, Dil De Diya is amazing, Seeth Maar is ok but Allu Arjuns version was far better and its placement could be betterSalman Khan does his part well though he has done such roles many times and it's time he changes his style\nDisha Patani is for ornamental value\nJackie Shroff annoys in his role\nRandeep Hooda excels while Sudhanshu Pandey has 2 scenes, Pravin Tarde leaves a mark\nSiddharth Jadhav is wasted."
"What a ham movie can't even imagine that it could be so bad race 3 was better than this..I bet this time the fans will also not accept thisWhat a waste of randeep hooda and the quality of villains is also so poor like teasing girls jackie shroff is this the humour you offer us after being such a senior actor..dialogues will make you baffled..all the blames goes to prabhudeva he is taking undue advantage of we respected him for his danceRepeated scenes like give me miss call to get the number ,Radhe is only cop who can solve this ,drugs in the city are some of the loose scenes you will see ..mindless action like Radhe can beat any number and any size of people at a time followed by ham secenes like no body is powerful than Radhe and he is god for every oneLastly Salman was at his worst and Disha was for no useThanks that you made this blunder for 1 1/5 hour."
I just don't understand y Netflix is targeting specific audience with this junk Instead try to give this audience what cinema is ........ crap/junk content movies like this
"I wasn't that much of a fan of the first movie but I still had hopes this for this movie. Whilst it isn't a bad movie, it definitely is a step down from the first movie.Unless you've escaped a mental asylum or on more drugs than all the riverdale writers put together, you shouldn't like the very uncharismatic Noah Centineo. He tries his best but he cones of so bland. He seriously effects the film and the chemistry with Lana Condor. Lana Condor is really great as is Jordan Fisher when they are on the screen, it becomes more investing.My issue is that Lana Condor was a refreshingly different character in the first movie but here she feels like the other movies, the first movie didn't try to be. That being the film is sweet enough despite being riddled with more cliches than your typical teen film. The ending however is a let down.That being said it is an enjoyable film which does have a lot of charm and heart but it just doesn't stand out that much. It is still worth watching and it's not exactly a bad film. I hope if they do a third movie I seriously hope it is better."
'Most pathetic movie. They have put the nation and armed forces to shame by making such a horrible movie. The script is all jumbled. CGI is poor. Direction is horrible and acting pathetic. The female spy is an epitome of overacting and all others are like stone. Avoid at all cost.'
"What a hopeless movie, full of over acting. Doesn't deserve even two star. Any one enjoying such trash should be brave enough."
"'Just enjoyed first 45 mins and Vijay sethupathi portions, without him Master is a waste of time! Nothing new to offer and to be entertained!'"
"You know what to expect when you watch a Vijay movie. The only difference from the usual Vijay movies is the space given to Bhavani(Vijay Sethupathi).\nI didn't have much expectations so the movie was not disappointing.\nI felt like the script needed so much refinement.\nFirst of all, they should stop treating Vijay as a superstar within the movie. He should play the character not Vijay. The choreography in dance numbers were really disappointing. I'm waiting(pun not intended) for a dance number like Ella Pugazhum. Andrea's character is an example of poor writing. They just placed the archery scene for the sake of that chase. It could've been executed better. And Gayathri should've been just another teacher who plays an important role in the plot. Making her fall in love with Vijay was really cringe. Songs were poorly placed. Especially Antha Kanna Pathakka. It interrupted the flow of the movie. I expected better action scenes too. Vijay is one of the best(and few) Indian actor who can easily handle action.\nIt's Vijay Sethupathi's Bhavani who steals the show. He's brilliant and terrifying villain who talks in a polite manner. The way he belittles the protagonist's emotions was really good. It's the long and nearly ridiculous scenes in the climax what kills the mood."

"It's certainly engaging, especially for a film that never leaves the one location of an emergency call center, & Gyllenhaal gives his all. I just wish the plot wasn't so ham-fisted, melodramatic, & oddly unnatural. How would someone this volatile get to keep this job? Of course, maybe that's the point; the privilege of white men is dangerously potent. Still, that message works better if the storytelling convinces us of that point instead of assuming we'll just blindly agree with it."

"'James Bond (Daniel Craig) followed the previous M\'s instruction to kill Marco Sciarra. He only shows the message to Moneypenny (Naomie Harris). This leads to an embarrassing Mexico City incident for the new M (Ralph Fiennes) who suspends Bond. M is organizing a merger with MI-5 and C (Andrew Scott) is creating surveillance system Nine Eyes looking to shut down 00. Bond steals a car from Q (Ben Whishaw) to attend Sciarra\'s funeral where he meets his wife Lucia (Monica Bellucci). Using the stolen Sciarra ring, Bond infiltrates a Spectre meeting headed by Blofeld (Christoph Waltz). Dr. Madeline Swann (LÃ©a Seydoux) is the daughter of a murdered Spectre agent and key to bringing down the organization.With the return of Spectre, I was hoping for a great villain to take his place among the greats of Bond villains. Waltz barely gets up in his first scene and takes forever to return. He\'s a missed opportunity for a supervillain. Andrew Scott is the sleazy weasel but he\'s not that guy. This movie is exceedingly cool and filled with sharp action. It\'s missing something. It\'s missing greatness. It\'s missing the great memorable thing. The movie is sometimes a little slow with long expositions. The audience don\'t really need it. They already know who the bad guys are. They just need Bond to catch up and find them. This is a fine Bond movie but one that may be forgotten among the rest.'"
"'Spectre', much like 'Quantum of Solace', has to follow a game changing Bond film, and comes up short.It's hard to say why. All the ingredients that made 'Skyfall' good are retained here, but the story never quite gels, the set pieces veer from silly to stupendous, and at the centre of it all we have Daniel Craig who looks a bit bemused (and dare I say bored) by it all.The tone is off too. Ok, Craig is never going to be a pun heavy Bond like Roger Moore, but his delivery of the 'comedy' aspects is almost delivered through gritted teeth.It's also a violent film indeed, how it was only a 12A is shocking. Eye gouging, suicide, torture- a trip to the cinema with the kids this was not.It all makes for a muddled Bond film, that has now has its ending spoilt, because despite Craig saying he'd never return to the role, come Spring he's back again.Can't wait after this..."
"'This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele\'s song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced Quantum of Solace, Skyfall is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed Skyfall a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film.'"
"'After the Bond begins movie with Daniel Craig (also known as Casino Royal), I came to terms into where Bond was moving to. And watching Jason Bon... ah sorry I mean James Bourne of course. No, but seriously, after many years, where Bond was the one that got copied, Bond now tries to stay in touch with the times and went air-bo(u)rne (pun intended).You can hold it against this movie, as well as the fact, that Bond never get\'s to say his name on-screen (Bond. James Bond), but does that really matter? For some it does, but I think if you survived the Casino Royale deconstruction of Bond, than you should be prepared, what to expect here.I liked the raw-ness of Bond and I also liked the ending, which is so Anti-Bond, that it has an original flavour and adds to the whole thing. Of course there isn\'t much of a plot here ... it\'s a continuation to the Casino Royale story, or better it sort of concludes that. I did like the movie, because I got my head around one thing ... to rephrase a quote: Bond is dead, long live the (new) Bond! I\'m not that excited about the whole thing yet, but maybe after the third one, I will be! And a movie that get\'s that much attention and get\'s discussed and even taken apart by some, has to have something going for it.'"
"'The story is invariably the sort of video-gamey, pop-corn, destroying-extraterrestrial-creature nonsense, the name Project Starfish is a dead giveaway of its arch-villain, but Gunn\'s script swiftly throw barbs towards USA government\'s aggressive foreign policy, hypocrisy, callousness and backdoor skulduggery, its patriotism is tainted by a mean streak that trivializes another country\'s human life. It is quite chilling to see Bloodsport and Peacemaker have a grisly killing competition then realize the rebel armies they massacred are actually allies, but there is no consequences, as long as they share the same enemy. Then, as the last resort, it is the puissance of the have-nots, the multitude, symbolically denoted by teeming rodents, that save the day, THE SUICIDE SQUAD is nothing if not politically perceptive.read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.'"
"'Cruella is like high fashion: it has a very interesting look, but it\'s not my style. This movie breaks the cardinal rule of show, don\'t tell, by having unnecessary narration the whole time. It also seems to be afraid of silence, as the soundtrack distractingly jumps from hit song to hit song. Emma Stone was okay. Emma Thompson was great, but overused. The story is mostly predictable. I don\'t mean to be cruel, but this unnecessary prequel is an overly long series of disjointed scenes.'"
"'Cruella (2021)' is at its best when it isn't trying to tie into 'One Hundred And One Dalmatians (1961)', especially considering that its attempts to do so are clumsy at best and poorly conceived at worst (it retroactively renders Pongo and Perdita brother and sister, and their fifteen biological puppies incest babies). Really, there's no need for this to be focused on a pre-existing character (aside from money, that is), since Cruella's characterisation is very different to how she is presented in her initial appearance. The film itself is a bit ham-fisted in places and it also feels rather long. The first hour is, more or less, set-up for the actual premise of the piece (Cruella using her fashion design as revenge), so the thing certainly could've done with a bit of a trim. Having said that, it is generally very well-made. The cinematography is crisp, the set design is cohesive, the performances are suitably scene-chewing and the costume design is simply fabulous (an Oscar very well may be coming its way for that department). When it's fully underway, the thing is relatively enjoyable in a passive sort of way. It isn't especially engaging, but it's never boring, either. Some of it is straight-up silly and some of it is bizarrely dark, but it has its highlights, for sure. It's a little bit middle of the road, yet it has just enough successful elements to be worth watching. It certainly isn't as bad as I anticipated. 6/10."
"'Take away: Males have always, in all animal species (yes, that includes humans), raped females (sometimes even another species); sometimes multiple times; sometimes when pregnant; commit infanticide; selfishly exploit them; more willing to abandon them, e.g. Afghanistan; in some religions & cultures treat them as less valuable property than cattle (usually the onus is placed on females to cover themselves and remain mostly secreted indoors), In the US we call such enforcers - Republicans; males use that same hormonal biology for aggression, murder, killing-for-sport, war.

"Maybe I'm missing something, but for all the hype this film has gained I expected a little more than what I saw."
"How courteous is the Japanese\nHe always says 'excuse it, please'\nHe walks into his neighbour's garden\nAnd smise and says 'I beg your pardon'\nHe bows, and grins a little grin\nAnd brings his hungry family in\nHe grins, and bows a little bow\n'So sorry, this MY garden now'.That verse by Ogden Nash, itself a satire, may well contain the nucleus of Parasite, a movie in which nothing is sacred and anything goes. I am unable to put my hand on my heart and agree with the Academy that it was the Best Picture of 2019 but I can say that it was far from the worst. Most viewers in the West, of course, were obliged to rely on subtitles to follow the story and while subtitles have never been a problem for me I always feel a slight sense of loss if a given piece of art is not written in my first language; if, for example, I am watching, say, Uncle Vanya, sitting next to a native Russian speaker, and the English translation is the finest possible I still feel that the native speaker is getting ten or twenty per cent more out of the play than I am via untranslatable nuances. So it was with Parasite but what remains is highly enjoyable."
"The Kim family leeches off others and lives in a basement apartment. The son Ki-woo gets a job tutoring a young girl. Using a series of lies, each member of the Kim family gets a job at the rich Park family home.I actually found the Kim family too annoying to watch at the beginning. The pizza box incident reminds me of some real life people who are impossible to work with. It's frustrating to sit through. It took a couple of tries. I prefer my grifting with better humor and better style. This family is just annoying. Pizza girl should never hire them for anything. It does get better. There is better humor and I get more in tune with the movie as it continues. I would prefer the driver to be less horny. He needs to be a complete saint. In fact, the rich family needs to be perfect at first so that they can slowly reveal their flaws. Also, they need to lay down the ghost story much earlier and sprinkle in some clues. The twist is unforeseen. That's mostly good but it would be better if the audience can suspect something like that. I do like the smell aspect. It's foreshadowed well and has a great build-up. There are scenes which I can almost smell. This is a very compelling statement about class in society."
"That's not really a home invading home topic, or in a very special way. I reminded another movie from 2013 and Netherlands called BORGMAN, very close about the topic and even more weird; try it if you can. I prefered BORGMAN, but that one if far better brilliant, bloody, ironic, cynical."

"'This is what happens when you have a script for a porno and think you know what? I bet if I make the sex scenes less explicit I can turn this into a theatrical movie, but you keep the awful dialogue and the disgusting kidnaping plot that was too tasteless for even the most desperate porn studios and expect no one to notice.Also, from a writing standpoint, what\'s the point of making it 365 days to fall in love with him if she\'s just gonna fall in love with him on like the third day? Couldn\'t they at least made it clearer how much time has passed, because half the time I have no idea if it\'s been week or five months. It does feel like a year, that\'s for sure.'"
"Let's be completely honest with each other. Either you are a Disney nerd and everything they spit out is a golden turd or you are anti-crap and dislike when studios recycle, regurgitate the same CG, same script, same BS every few years. Like Disney does with its animated movies.I bet they used a lot of the same animation/CG that they did in the Pirates of the Caribbean. The scary Spaniards are exactly like them, complete copies in every respect. The story is also very similar to the Fountain of Youth from Pirates of the Caribbean. The surface has changed, but everything underneath the hood is the same.The casting is OK, the acting is childish, the script is meh. The movie is completely predictable. I became bored within a few moments, but tried to stay with it. The family enjoyed it. Silly, childish fun.I didn't care for it. I ended up stopping about half way.If you aren't looking for much in quality, then this might be your thing."
"'In 1982, Ridley Scott released Blade Runner, based on Philip K. Dick\'s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. It had two focuses. One was the question of what makes us human, as the protagonist (Harrison Ford) starts to question his order to capture the renegade replicants. The other was the look at a dystopian future, as there\'s no connection to the natural world and the population gets bombarded by advertising everywhere.Now, Incendies and Arrival director Denis Villeneuve has released a sequel: Blade Runner 2049. The sequel expands on the original\'s dystopian focus, as anyone with the economic means has departed the moribund planet. A new corporation has replaced the one from the original movie, and has continued making replicants. A new blade runner (Ryan Gosling) is the protagonist here, but there\'s more than meets the eye.The visuals are impressive. I guess that my complaint is that the plot takes a long time to get going, and a lot of the movie is shots of the protagonist\'s face to the tune of music. Even so, I\'d say that the movie is worth seeing, if not as great as the original.'"
"I always make it a rule to only ever do a review once a show or film is ended. In this case, I started about forty minutes in, for one reason only, I was bored to tears.I love the original film, and although a film I thought never needed a follow up, but I was open to it, and thought the basic storyline in this film was pretty good, and imaginative.I'll start with the positives, it looks amazing, genuinely, the effects, sets and all aspects of the visuals are seriously impressive, that's the major strength, the acting is hard to fault, Gosling is always on point.The downer...... It's insanely boring, how on Earth did they allow this film to be so slow, you almost forgive the first hour, where literally nothing happens, you convince yourself that it's bound to open up and switch up several gears. It never really does though, it improves, but it seems to be on half speed for large spells.I struggled with the plot a bit, possibly because there isn't one.In summary, the window dressing is terrific, it looks sensational, incredibly well acted, the problem, it bored me to tears. 5/10."
"'Back when THe Wolf of Wall Street debuted, I had very little interest in watching it. After all, it was infamous for being crude and nasty. Well, tonight I have to stay awake and I found nothing else on demand I wanted to see...so I gave it a try. After seeing it, it WAS indeed sleazy, crude and nasty from start to finish and it seemed typical of many of Martin Scorsese\'s films. And, like his films, it\'s was well made. But for me, it was relentlessly awful and unappealing. Sure, it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars...but despite this I found myself turned off by such a downbeat and unlikable story. Considering that there are over 1200 revews for this one, I really have nothing more to add other than I just didn\'t enjoy it and, in hindsight, wish I hadn\'t bothered.'"
"'A crackling good crime story from director David Fincher, who meticulously mounts this impeccable and brutal true-life mystery with aplomb. A serial killer self-nicknamed The Zodiac is terrorizing Northern California in the late-1960s. Jake Gyllenhaal is solid as Robert Graysmith, a divorced dad with two kids who\'s employed at the San Francisco Chronicle as the resident cartoonist; he becomes completely absorbed by the newspaper\'s reporting of (and the police department\'s concurrent investigation into) the series of grisly murders happening in and around the Bay Area. The film, based on Graysmith\'s non-fiction book by James Vanderbilt, is intense and unsettling, packing reams of detail and criminal minutiae into its running time--most of which dead-ends or winds up discarded (in a case that was never solved). Excellent performances by all, including Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as the two principle police inspectors on the case, also John Carroll Lynch as a factory worker and potential suspect. Not for every taste; however, as a portrait of hard-working people obsessed with solving a baffling case that dragged on for decades, it\'s quite riveting. Amazingly, no Oscar nominations. *** from ****'"
"MIDSOMMAR (2019) * Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Vilhelm Blomgren, William Jackson Harper, Will Poulter. To Quote the late, great Roger Ebert : I Hated, Hated, Hated This Movie\nAri Aster is the 21st century M. Night Shyamalan ; um - that is not a good thing. He's a one-trick pony. His sophomore film follow up to the jaw-dropping horror film HEREDITARY is a major disappointment, a blatant rip-off of THE WICKER MAN and ultimately an exercise in futility. A group of friends are invited by another from Sweden to attend a nine-day celebration of his small hometown that quickly downward spirals into the fact that it's (duh) a cult with hellish consequences. While Pugh is arguably the best thing about the major misfire the biggest conflict is having any empathy for four obnoxious twenty somethings (not one can you root for or relate to as to the (sur)reality of their nightmare unfolding.

"First of all, did I enjoy this movie from Christopher Nolan? Was I entertained for the entire duration which was quite long? On both questions I have to answer yes. Now I don't concider myself as dumb, but I'm not a genius either, but this movie is so hard to follow, almost at the point you pain your brain trying to figure out what's going on. I'm happy I'm not the only one that didn't understand much of the complexity of the story. Like some other reviewers stated it's probably better to watch it a second time to fully, or at least partially understand, but I'm not going to do that. Tenet is just one of those movies that need your full constant attention, very difficult to understand but that isn't bad for the matter. The cinematography is great, with excellent action scenes, and a cast that did a very good job. John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, the two main characters are pleasant to watch. In conclusion, I'm surprised I liked this movie as I didn't get it all, but I'm not sure it will please everybody, certainly not the picky viewers."

"'The first 80-90% of Interstellar I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn\'t make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It\'s sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful Gravity, it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it\'s a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.'"
"'Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they\'re supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth\'s Knock Knock is one such movie.I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of Grindhouse (Tarantino\'s collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the \'70s), and then co-starred in Inglourious Basterds as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of Citizen Kane and Dr. Strangelove. If Knock Knock is any indication, Roth\'s own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it.'"

There comes a certain amount of Blind Allegiance to keep Supporting the Ultra-Unsatisfying Stuff He puts out.In this one Keanu Reeves Strains. Some of His Speeches are Cringe-Inducing to Say the Least. Smacking, of ad-lib, it is just Embarrassing.The One-Note Plot involves the Familiar, Heavy Handed, and Deep Lesson about Marital infidelity and its Ramifications. One of the Things Roth Thinks is a Twist in this Dismal Failure may be the Lack of Gore, or any Physical Violence for that matter, in an Against Type Take, but Shows His Vast Inability to Handle Things in a Psychological Thriller. In Eli Roth\'s World Art Does Not Exist.'"

Bo (Brian Van Holt) needs to finish the funeral before selling the fan belt. The couple decides to go into the closed House of Wax. Their friends are driving back after getting stuck in traffic.This thing starts pretty slow. It turns into a traditional slasher horror movie. The good news is that Paris Hilton gets killed. The wax figures are good creepy background. Elisha Cuthbert is a good scream queen and there is nothing wrong with a slasher movie where pretty young people get massacred."
"'The subject is not new,there were lots and lots of movie where people became waxworks in museums .Andre de Toth has an eponymous movie (1952) where the criminal was in love with a waxy Marie Antoinette.Okay the final special effects are quite impressive when the whole house is melting.But the best scenes are the ones where the horror is mastered:in the church,in the house (where there could be someone alive),and in the places where the inhabitants  of the town are gathered.The sequence in the movie theater is rather impressive ,and the use of Whatever happened to Baby Jane? makes sense ,for the two sisters were monsters too and Davis on the big screen is somewhat waxy .(But make no mistake :Aldrich\'s film is a true masterpiece,which House of wax (2005) is not,far from it.) The characters are as uninteresting as any of the Friday the Thirteenth boy and girl.And the unexpected final twist is here to justify a more than possible House of Wax 2 ...Let it melt away!'"
'With a title like HOUSE OF WAX one can be forgiven for thinking you\'re going to be watching a Vincent Price type character adducting young maidens and embalming them with dumb periphery characters pointing and saying  Oh look at those waxworks . They\'re so life like . If I didn\'t know better I\'d think that they were real people  This isn\'t how things work out and would have perhaps have been preferable to what we have here Effectively this HOUSE OF WAX is yet another long line of horny teenagers in peril which died out sometime in the late 1980s . It\'s easy to understand why because there\'s not a lot of mileage to the formula especially to someone who grew up with this type of movie . If there\'s anything that differentiates it from so many films of this genre it\'s got some graphic torture porn and is a bit more graphic than the norm but even then that\'s only damning praise . Looking on the bright side it gives me an excuse to write another basic uninterested and uninteresting comment disguised as a review'
"House of Wax (2005) * 1/2 (out of 4) The second remake of Michael Curtiz's Mystery of the Wax Museum is updated to today's times and features six teens stranded in a small town where two psycho brothers are turning people to wax. I'm all for remakes when they can get things right but that's not the case here. There aren't any scares and the first hour is downright boring. I guess the filmmakers were wanting to go back to the 80's slashers but you don't go an hour without any action. When the thing finally picks up it's not too bad and there's some nice twists that happen to our main hero, which isn't normal for this type of film. I can't say I'm a fan of Paris Hilton but she actually did the best job out of the cast. If you need to see wax then check out one of the previous two films. Although the film borrows heavily from those two films this here is more in line with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
"I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's\nGore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 2/5\nComedy 0/5"
"Yes, this is very good. The hashtag worked. Fans were delighted. I'm not a fan, it wouldn't have mattered to me even if this version wasn't made. But still well done. But this is not a good idea. Now the director of every bad movie will release his own version? Don't do it, that's enough."
"Unlike the 1984 David Lynch film, this one is the correct length and therefore all the more elaborate than the aforementioned version. And because of that, there is more character development and story. But that said, this version I have to say is anemic when compared to the 1984 film version. Here are my reasons: there is no memorable music (unlike the original version which featured a superb score by Toto or Children of Dune which featured a memorable score by Brian Tyler), the acting was okay when compared to the original (there's no Patrick Stewart per say), and the visual effects was far inferior to either the 1984 version and Children of Dune. So, all in all, this film is an okay adaptation of Frank Herbert's beloved novel though it is much more elaborate than the 1984 film version."
"'. . . American Life, then you owe it to yourself to see Universal\'s NOBODY. Whether it\'s the White House, the U. S. Capitol or your own living room, title character Hutch learns here that the tentacles of the Russian oligarchical cancer is probing every nook and granny of our U. S. Homeland with virtual impunity. Anyone who takes umbrage at these outrageous assaults is subjected to sudden kidnapping, sadistic beatings and even horrible death, NOBODY reveals. But this flick updates that old gangster dictum (Three in the head leaves them dead) with a new and improved motto for fighters of the Red Communist KGB: Three heads with one shot really saves on bullets. Now that Major League Baseball has been forced to rescue its All-Star Game from the Kremlin\'s malignant voter suppression hotbed, NOBODY suggests that Coke, Dr. Pepper and CNN must swiftly follow suit. As Hutch would say, everybody should boycott peaches and peanut products, too, until Russia gets its crooked nose out of America\'s business!'"
"You never know - usually it is not good for anything. Especially when it comes to single man missions. And this has the backdrop of real war (written all over it). And it also has the one shot movie - you know when there is no visible cut and according to the filmmaker there wasn't any? I mean there is one moment where we go completely dark, so ... and there is always a possibility to cut. But they swear they didn't do it here, so let's take that at face value.The effects are great, the cinematography was a shoe in for the Academy Award ... and it won. Not a surprise. Having said that, there is enough excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Masterfully played (especially if you think about how many takes it probably took to do this) and great production values. This is a masterpiece, no matter if the subject matter is your thing or not"
"Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes."
"A PG-rated Battle Royale. The Running Man with mood swings and acne. The mere thought of a Hollywood adaptation of the latest novel to grace every teenagers' bookshelf was enough to make me shudder in fear (I've seen Twilight; that was enough for me). How could they possibly make this derivative, undoubtedly tame, and probably sappy nonsense appeal to anyone other than hormonal adolescents? Amazingly, they have.I've just finished watching The Hunger Games with my 11-year-old daughter (who kindly gave me a running commentary on exactly how the film compares with the book) and was amazed at just how much I enjoyed its grim dystopian visionâa post apocalyptic world where freaky future-folk with crazy multi-coloured hair happily watch a group of kids killing each other with a variety of sharp/pointy things in an arena where genetically altered killer wasps, computer-controlled forest fires, and mutant man-eating dogs also present a very real danger.With decent direction from Gary Ross, a fine central performance from the rather lovely Jennifer Lawrence (who reminds me of a young Renee Zellweger, which ain't a bad thing), plus memorable supporting turns from Woody Harrelson (so cool), Isabelle Fuhrman (so scary), and Donald Sutherland (so loathsome), I have to admit that the film was a lot more fun than I expected it to be."
"Somehow I have my doubts as to whether Diablo Cody's Oscar for Juno's screen play is going to be joined by one for Jennifer's Body. Where Juno was a breath of fresh air, Jennifer's Body is a cheerfully trashy and utterly familiar high school teen horror with a dash of comedy thrown in.Megan Fox is, of course, the main attraction. She gets to say some raunchy dialogue and to tease the male element of the audience as much as some of her victims. But I haven't yet seen anything showing she can act - here she is required to pout, smoulder and be generally sultry and provocative, all things which come fairly naturally out of what she looks like. What she isn't required to do, however, is demonstrate any real acting ability. And I couldn't see a great deal of difference between her character before and after the demon took up residence in her.Amanda Seyfried has the meatier role, and attacks it with relish.The script is functional and, in places, fun.The horror element is satisfactory and the ending is not bad.The film overall is, of its kind, undemanding fun."
"'Multiple Halloween stories all taking place on the same night at the same time. One concerns a man who is decorating his house, another is a girl who is a virgin looking for the right guy, another has an old man fighting a demon, another is the story of a school principle who is also a serial killer. There are also other threads running through this very busy horror film.I\'m going to be honest and say that I don\'t know what I think of this film. Its certainly good, but I went to it hearing about how great and wonderful it was that seeing it I was rather disappointed. To me there are a some chills but no real scares. I think the fragmented nature, the film bounces backward and forward through the night , hurts the film in that no story builds up momentum enough to be truly scary. Don\'t get me wrong the film is full of neat ideas, good looking monsters, great performances and some nice EC Comics style twists, but it just didn\'t scare me. Honestly I think had I seen this film sans the hype I would have also thought this film was the next big thing, however as it stands now I like it not love it.Most definitely worth a look or two (I want to see it again closer to Halloween), this is a good solid horror film.'"
"Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is searching for a child serial killer, and catches Alex Jones (Paul Dano) in an old RV. Meanwhile, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) lose their daughters during a gathering. Loki has to let Jones loose, but Dover is not letting him go.Paul Dano always does a great creep. Jake Gyllenhaal does a capable cop, but I think he overacts sometimes. The interrogation room scene comes out of nowhere. I think that was a mistake. The big acting comes from Hugh Jackman. He's the key to this movie. It's possibly his best performance. He is intense without being melodramatic. What Keller Dover does in the movie is absolutely fascinating, and morally dangerous. I do wish the film go full out on that route. The film does let him escape morally a little too easily.Director Denis Villeneuve is a skilled Quebec filmmaker. He has fashioned a tight intense thriller. However, it resolves too neatly. It's a dirty dark movie. I'd prefer an ugly dark ending. Although I'm not going deduct any points for that."
"'Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello star in Prisoners from 2013, directed by Denis Villeneuve.When two little girls go missing on Thanksgiving Day, one of the fathers, Keller Dover (Jackman) reels completely out of control searching for her. He kidnaps one of the suspects (Paul Dano) and tortures him for information, and, a recovering alcoholic, starts drinking again. The policeman on the case, Loki (Gyllenhaal) starts trailing him while searching for the children and looking at suspects.What a dark, gritty movie, photographed in muted colors that make the film look old. The landscape is stark. People aren\'t particularly well-dressed. The cars are old.This is a movie about prisoners of all types - emotional, physical, addictive. In Prisoners, everyone is just that, in his or her own way. Truly a suspenseful movie with a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman -- perhaps his best -- as the crazed father. A brooding Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the police officer who is desperate to find the girls.Prisoners is not always easy to watch, but you won\'t be able to turn away.'"
"I won't labor on the plot, but will just make a few comparisons. The other film was made for TV and was limited it what it could do. This production only concerns the childhood and not the second part as adults. The special effects were improved to make for a far more scary and intense film. Some of the original dialogue appears and I had a few moments of deja vu. I thought the child actors were better. This reboot is superior to the initial in every way.Guide: F-words. No sex or nudity."
"IT is the first of a two-part modern reworking of the Stephen King classic, first adapted for the screen with the miniseries back in 1990. I like the miniseries a lot, and Tim Curry's interpretation of Pennywise remains definitive, but the 2017 IT is surprisingly decent. It has a far more adult edge than the miniseries, and it's much, much darker. It seems to capture the dark heart of the King novel very well, the very essence of it, while the real asset lies in the all-child cast; the performances are generally excellent, going for realism over sympathy or sentiment and feeling very true to life as a result. The scares are well telegraphed and perhaps a little too inevitably reliant on CGI trickery, but for a modern horror they're quite effective. I didn't mind the updating to the 1980s setting either as it makes sense to follow King's trend of setting the past scenes 27 years before the present day. Despite the flaws I found this to be one of the stronger horror films to come from Hollywood in recent years; there's something pleasingly old-fashioned about a film that emphasis strong plotting rather than a series of jumps or chases descending into tedium."
"'it has the gift to become a personal story. because it is a film about dreams, about past, about memories who could stop or rule the present. in same measure, it is an ambitious project. maybe to ambitious because the story becomes a huge map in which plains and seas are mixed. not the last, it is one of demonstration of the art of Leonardo diCaprio. beautiful, precise but, maybe, too obvious. the original theme - the mind control - becomes an unlimited labyrinth. a story about spies becomes a psychological one. all in a oppressive rhythm, with explanations who are status of parts of lesson, with different levels who transforms it in a kind of video game. but its virtue is to be perfect choice for different viewers. and this does it great.'"
"'While the spoof movie seemed to live a quiet life for quite some years, Scary Movie did resurrect it. Seeing what movies it brought us, it should be charged. But let\'s stay focused on this movie. A movie which makes fun of ... well Scary Movie(s).As a basic storyline Scream is being ripped off, which originally was called, yep you guessed it: Scary Movie! While it tries hard to get as many laughs as possible out of that concept, it is doomed to fail (in my eyes) from the get go. Spoofing a movie, that is already a funny/cynical take on the horror movies, doesn\'t really quite work as good as it should. In contrast to classics, such as Airplane!, where the object/movie that\'s being spoofed took itself seriously, Scream was meant to be funny. So how many jokes can there be? Well not that many, because other movies (or TV Series) get dragged into the mix. Unfortunately it never really hit a high point (one of the best things is the Wassup call) with me ...'"
"I was expecting absolutely no plot, but we actually get a small one. It seems it's time for the Earthrealm fighters and Outworld fighters to square off. Outworld has won 9 times in a row and if wins again will take over Earth. So not only do the fighters have to save themselves, they must also save mankind. Sub zero beings to hunt down Cole, whose ancester was Scorpion. Jax and Sonya Blade hunt him down and tell him about the Mortal Kombat tournament. Sonya has captured Kano whom has the mark of the dragon like Cole and Jax. From there, they go to the temple of Raiden to seek training and learn their secret powers. Shang Tsung tries to cheat by engaging in combat before the tournament, so all our characters end up taking each other on. We get some good fights and gore( not very realistic) but still cool. Scorpion shows up at the end and breathes fire, cool. I think you need to know something about the video game and its characters to really enjoy this movie.FINAL VERDICT: If you like the video game, I think you will like this. You can still enjoy the fights if you don't know much about the game. Worth a view."
"'This film is about a freed slave partnering with a bounty hunter to seek revenge and free his wife.Django Unchained is a action western, but it is far too long to be interesting and engrossing. At almost three hours, it is a struggle to follow the story and keep being interested in it. There is far too much dialog to be an action film. For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours. It\'s a Quentin Tarantino film, so you know there has to be a lot of blood to the point of being almost comical, and that almost everybody dies in the end. So why not just cut to the chase and show us what we are expecting?'"
"'If you\'re familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of Thirtysomething, My So-Called Life, Relativity, and Once and Again, you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That\'s the case with this movie that they\'re also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who\'s always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I\'ll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film\'s story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?'"
"'The movie starts out as a great man\'s comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics. This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss\'s girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson\'s disease which is why she is a free spirit.Jake falls in love, turning this into Love Story, then the comedy simply dies.Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb.'"
"'It seems like a no-brainer to me that an adult sex comedy should first and foremost be sexy. But director Edward Zwick and his writers must disagree with me, because, abundance of Anne Hathaway\'s boobies and the seemingly endless scenes of naughtiness between her and Jake Gyllenhaal aside, I found little to titillate me in this droopy comedy.Hathaway, though a fine actress, has absolutely zero sex appeal, so she\'s a terrible choice for this role. And it doesn\'t help that she has no chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Therefore, the entire movie\'s bottom falls out from under it, because the whole point is that these two oversexed young \'uns with a fear of commitment (he because he\'s a mimbo, she because she\'s got a degenerative disease) find in each other the soul mate who makes all the hard things about relationships that they\'ve been trying to avoid worth dealing with. It\'s hard to believe these two are soul mates when they have about as much romantic spark between them as I have with my own sister.Edward Zwick has long held a place in my top 5 list of least favorite directors, and this movie didn\'t do much to change his ranking.Grade: C'"
"A fairly standard romance. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a representative (i.e., salesman) for Pfizer who meets up with Anne Hathaway in a doctor's office and falls for her. At first he just assumes she's a prescription medicine junky (which he obviously doesn't look down on, since he's pretty much just a pusher). It turns out, though, that she really does have Parkinson's disease and is refusing to let him get closer to her because she doesn't want to hurt him (or be hurt by him if he runs away when things get too rough). The film does work, though, mostly because Hathaway is excellent. Gyllenhaal's pretty good, too. You also get some good supporting performances from people like Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt and Judy Greer. One big negative aspect: Gyllenhaal's fat, obnoxious younger brother played by Josh Gad. I think they wanted to cast Jonah Hill, but he was too big a star for such a role. Gad is a lookalike with about half as much talent. But, really, the flaw is mostly in the writing. The guy's a pretty poor excuse for comic relief. He does completely unbelievable things (like masturbating to a sex tape starring his brother and his brother's girlfriend, then, when getting caught, asking his brother how his penis got so big?!?!), and his joke lines are completely unfunny."

"From director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State), I was hoping this action thriller film would be more enjoyable. Basically a wave of kidnappings have swept in Mexico City, and Rayburn (Christopher Walken) has brought ex-CIA operative/assassin John Creasy (Denzel Washington) to be the bodyguard of nine year old Lupita' Pita' Martin (War of the World's Dakota Fanning), daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) and wife Lisa Martin (Silent Hill's Radha Mitchell). Creasy is against it at first, and when he does accept with nothing better to do, he is at first in no mood to socialise with Pita, but she does slowly get him to open up to her. But Creasy's new found purpose is taken away when Pita is kidnapped, and he is now out to kill anyone involved with or profiting from the kidnapping. Also starring Giancarlo Giannini as Manzano, Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Mariana, JesÃºs Ochoa as Fuentes, Mickey Rourke as Jordan Kalfus and Angelina PelÃ¡ez as Sister Anna. The friendship between the ex-assassin and the little girl hits the right notes, but I agree with the critics that the film slips into absurdity Washington is out for revenge, and only a few explosions and some violence keep you hooked. Worth watching, at least once!"
"'FORGIVENESS IS BETWEEN THEM AND GOD...\n...IT IS MY JOB TO ARRANGE THE MEETING.Somehow when Denzel Washington says this line it is not as convincing as maybe Van Diesel. Washington and Dakota Fanning did their expected wonderful job, but the ending was all wrong for the movie.The movie starts out slow. Washington plays a Jack Daniels guzzling former CIA agent who reads the Bible. His partner, Christopher Walken, lands him a job guarding Dakota Fanning (Pita). Early in the movie we find out every rich person in Mexico hires a body guard, then gets kidnapping insurance from AIG for 10 million dollars, which the kidnappers know about. This sets you up for the expected plot twists which were not terrific.Denzel doesn\'t want to get friendly with Dakota, but ends up becoming her friend, father, swimming coach, chauffeur, etc. etc. Dakota Fanning gets kidnapped (box information). Denzel uses his CIA walking tall methods to go after the bad guys, which includes half of Mexico. The substandard script, slow beginning, and questionable ending took away from the production.The ending should have included a dramatic escape by Fanning involving her ability to swim as the movie centered so much on this aspect of her life.'"
"This is a comedic low brow 'The Big Chill' played for laughs and trying to make some points about parent and kids and relationships and material things are not important starring some rich Hollywood actors.The death of their old basketball coach causes some of the winning basketball team of 1978 to reunite. Adam Sandler is a rich Hollywood agent with a hot wife, Salma Hayek, spoilt kids and a nanny. Kevin James has a 4 year old who still drinks breast milk, Chris Rock has a wife who works whilst he is a stay at home dad, Rob Schneider lives with an older woman and has 3 kids from previous relationships who turn, two of them simply to provide eye candy for the audience.We have some gross out jokes such as urinating in a water-park pool, the dead coach's ashes being thrown over food, a boy breast feeding etc. Some spoilt brats too busy texting and wanting the finer things in life on demand.Over the weekend the kids enjoy the simpler things in life and learn to get along with other kids and grow up a bit.

"How do people who only watch this one entry feel about it? I reckon dissatisfied. Because the movie is only part of something bigger and tough to just judge on its own merits. Having said that, I personally feel it works as a standalone too - like a tv show that cuts off and leaves you out in the cold in the end - but was really good up to that point.In this case you have the choice to watch more and get a ... as some say fresh take on the slasher genre. Because while this kind of feels like a slasher movie ... it isn't. And you can tell early on, that there is more. It is only visual and it's a bit of a cheat (all things considering), but it does make sense - yes suspend your disbelief! You have to, no doubt about it.Another thing that there is no doubt about: you can't be squeamish! While there is nothing much here when it comes to nudity (and only a small amount of what could be called sexy time), there is a lot of blood and violence! As one should be expecting to see from a slasher ... on the violence scale that is. And just when you think you can sit back comfortably and relax .. the movie pulls you back in - quite literally working on the .. brain (pun very much intended)"

Cinematically, the picture reminded me of all those great black and white films of the Thirties and Forties emanating from the silent era. It even has a \'B\' quality look, though the subject matter goes beyond the simplistic efforts of early film, and challenges the viewer with a myriad of interpretations one could assign to the story. That the fate of the two men ends so tragically is no wonder given the exposition, and you\'ll come away convinced that it\'s bad luck to kill a seabird.'"
"OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.So-so. The movie LOOKS good (the deserted vessel is impressive) but the story is slow and the characters are never fully realized. Also top billed Gabriel Byrne (giving a terrible performance) is hardly in the movie. On the plus side Julianna Margulies is good and a strong female character (unusual in any horror movie) and Alix Dimitriades and Ron Eldard are good as members of the crew. Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. But the slow pace and a predictable and stupid ending sinks this (sorry). I can only give this a 5."
"'The brash James T. Kirk tries to live up to his father\'s legacy with Mr. Spock (Z. Quinto) keeping him in check as a vengeful, time-traveling Romulan creates black holes to destroy the Federation one planet at a time.Although I am not terribly familiar with the original series (I was a Next Generation fan), I get the feeling this film exists both within it and not. There are plenty of jokes, many of them cheesy, including the corny I\'m a doctor and Vulcan mind...It seems they are setting up this film series as an alternate reality. The older Spock (Spock Prime) is from the world we know, but everyone else is an altered timeline. What does that mean for the series? Are they free to make up their own rules?'"
"'This film is about James T. Kirk and his heroic rise to become the captain of USS Enterprise.Star Trek has great special effects which are stunningly real. It also has a tight and thrilling plot, which ensures some calamity happening once every ten minutes. The soundtrack is also very good, as it really enhances the suspense and thrill of the scenes, making viewers even more engaged to what was already engaging. To me, despite these positive points, I still find the plot confusing and very difficult to understand. I have more questions than answers after watching Star Trek. Maybe it\'s because this is the first Star Trek film I have ever watched.'"
"'What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary \'Eggsy\' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world\'s population. If it had been less dirty it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.DVD from my public library.'"
"THE CONJURING (2013) *** Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Tayor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Shannon Kook, John Brotherton. Affectively serviceable ghost story based on true events with paranormal investigating married team The Warrens (Farmiga and Wilson with chemistry to spare) who are enlisted by The Perron Family for help in their current haunting of an evil presence plaguing their new dwelling. Director James Wan pulls out all the stops and incorporates every trick in the book (creaking doors, Don't-go-down-that-dark-cellar ethos) and rams it full throttle and oddly enough works like gangbusters pushing all the right buttons in an equally workmanlike script by Carey & Chad Hayes. While frankly someone like me who very rarely gets scared with horror films like this (and echoing every genre flick from THE CHANGELING to POLTERGEIST) the average film-goer will have their collective nerves shred."
"A short Tim Burton film about a man who unexpectedly weds a corpse. The storyline is certainly different, but doesn't always flow well. The animation is creepy and cool, and over-exaggerated in that Tim Burton way. A great concept that could have been developed more."
"Good looking teen vampire story, that looks good and is about teen vampires. Clearly I'm the wrong person for this YA teen angst vampire tale because I found it the sort of thing thats been done before I don't know how many times (underworld,Lost Boys...). Not a bad film, its just the sort of thing that is aimed at its one audience and really no one else. Certainly the story feels YA, much like City of Ember, even if they try to make it more adult. Frankly this is a movie for fans of the book only (then again I know many fans of the book who hate the film). Yes the cast is good, but the plot just doesn't cut it.(Your choice out of 10. The rating is dependent upon how you feel about the source material and how many times you've seen similar stories)"
"'The film opens with realistic gag credits and playing Ann Murray (I think it was her and not a Juice Newton cover). We have our main character going after a bad guy (Ed Skrein), being interrupted Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) and introduces moody teen Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). The film then resorts to flashbacks of Ryan Reynolds (not to be confused with Green Lantern) aka Wade Wilson becoming the near super hero Dead Pool operating with his own set of vigilante/special operations ethics.The film spoofs Avenger/X-Men films with numerous asides and one liners. It is critical of the shallow film industry in general while creating the same shallow film. The language in this film is adult, more adult than Kick-Ass, but is much funnier. This is not for the kids, but a good comedy for adults who like super hero films and I also know people who don\'t like super hero films, but loved this one.Guide: Many F-words, brief sex and nudity. Deadpool 2 has been announced with Ryan Reynolds.Note to self: Seltzer water and lemon takes out blood'"
"I despise David Lynch's Dune. In my not so very humble opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen. It is utterly nonsensical and impossible to follow, the actors are almost all miscast (except for Sting, Dean Stockwell, and Patrick Stewart, who all mainly work as novelty), and the visuals are hideous. I also tried reading the novel once, but got bored after the first chapter.So when a friend asked me whether I wanted to watch the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries of Dune, I wasn't too enthusiastic about the whole thing. By the end of the first episode of three I was impressed at the technical side of the film. Vittorio Storaro, the same cinematographer who photographed Apocalypse Now and Reds, did an amazing job on this film, even if the visuals do go overboard sometimes. The gimmicks that the filmmakers employed most often worked well, especially the bizarre primary color lighting schemes. By the second episode, I felt I new the plot. By the end of the series, I felt that I knew the characters. While the narrative is still choppy and sometimes hard to follow (the biggest problem is that there are far too many characters in it), it ultimately works well. I felt that I had finally seen what Dune fanatics were raving about. This series is great. See it and forget that David Lynch ever dirtied his hands with his version."
"More so than with the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield takes on the Spider-Man character, it appears that the Tom Holland version is geared more toward a teen and young adult audience. Nothing wrong with that, because alter-ego Peter Parker is a teenager himself. But it just doesn't feel like a super-hero movie for me with all the high school kids running around and Spider-Man trying to get out of a world threatening assignment from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). I was surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal cast here as the film's principal villain, but liked the idea that he came on as a buddy-buddy to Peter before the reveal that showed him to be the mastermind behind the Elementals. The numbered Earth concept opens up a whole array of possibilities for future stories, so a franchise like this can go on forever. As a completist I'll be on board for future movies, though I'd like to see more in the way of character development and effective story telling. A little bit darker tone would also be of help."
"'In New York, the narcissist investment banker Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works in the bank of his fiancÃ©e\'s father and usually has dinner with his shallow coworkers at fashionable and expensive restaurants. Bateman worships notorious serial-killers, such as Ed Gein or Ted Bundy, and he is a psychopath. When his co-worker Paul Allen (Jared Leto) shows a business card of better quality than his, Bateman plots to kill him using the name of another colleague. He murders Paul with an ax and tapes a message in his answering machine telling that Paul is travelling to London. Soon the private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) investigates Paul\'s disappearance and interviews Bateman. Then Bateman hires two prostitutes to spend the night with him doing kinky sex and he tortures the women. Bateman tries to kill a homosexual co-worker; murders a model; and tries to kill his own secretary. Who will stop his crime spree?American Psycho is an ambiguous, dark and dramatic thriller about a sick yuppie that cannot control his death wish. The viewer never knows whether Patrick Bateman really kills the persons or is delusional with a perverted mind. The black humor and the mystery of the last scenes creates the doubt in the viewer. My vote is seven.Title (Beazil): Psicopata Americano (American Psycho)'"
"'I have to say, I found this to be a huge disappointment. I thought the first act was great but after that I just lost more and more interest in it. I want to do this in a few bullet points. What was up with Adele\'s sexuality? I thought the first act made it obvious that she\'s actually a lesbian and, although she\'s tried to make it work with males, she\'s just not able to (as evidenced by the events with the super hot guy in the beginning... If you don\'t want him, I\'ll take him Adele!). I thought this was very firmly established, so then why is she supposedly hooking up with a guy later on because she feels lonely? I thought being with men didn\'t fulfill anything in her? But she\'s with a man later on because she feels lonely? I wouldn\'t have a problem with this had the first act not contradicted this. Am I missing something? Maybe someone can clarify it...'"
"Cool premise. terrible execution. so many dumb moments and things that don't make sense if you just think about it for a second. like what if this different thing happened before, then what's happening now would never work. garbo movie (1 viewing)"
Really enjoyable film some kind similar to saw(I originally prefer saw over this). Idea and plot was good had some mistakes but still decent movie. Didn't get why that boy fall in ice and die. Like he didn't have any chance to win? So basically that's kind of mistake. Ending was predictable and like meh nothing special. I would recommend this film for lazy weekend. As 2019 only begins this looks decent year.
"'My third theater experience post-COVID and again it\'s from the horror genre. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It continues to follow the Warrens (Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga)) and their demon fighting. This movie takes place in Brookfield, Connecticut circa 1981. It begins with them assisting in the exorcism of a little boy named David (Julian Hilliard). The exorcism fails, but the demon left the little boy and entered a young man named Arne (Ruairi O\'Connor). Arne went on to commit a bloody murder and the Warrens were trying their best to prove that Arne was innocent for reasons of demon possession.For the sake of the movie I wanted them to prove their point. For the sake of reality I was hoping they\'d fail-- or succeed yet fail with the jury. I can\'t imagine a bigger monkey wrench in a flawed justice system than an acquittal based upon demon possession.The Conjuring offered some decent jump scares, but more importantly it had a good plot. The Warrens were trying to uncover a curse. The demon was summoned by someone for some sinister reason and the Warrens sought to uncover it. It was risky business, but it was something they believed in.'"

"'So I did not research the couple that is depicted here, but it always sounds better if you say that something is based on something real and true. This is pure horror but it still was a nice double bill with A Quiet Place 2 at the Festival I saw them the other day - so good to be back in cinemas. Now you may think that that may have swayed me to give this a bit of a higher/better rating that you would have given it ... maybe, but then again I am known for being nice to movies most of the time, than the other way around.Now I would say that you do not need to know the other movies to enjoy this. But of course if you do know your Conjuring-verse you will recognize certain things and have some fun with it. Just when Annabelle is mentioned for example ... but apart from those funny moments, you also have some genuine comedy in it. Let that not fool you ... because it also has a lot of scary moments ... and while you will probably be able to know where this is going, it still is very well told ... with a very tender and romantic moment towards the end, that made the audience go awww ... yes even horror can do that.'"

"Ten years after the events of the first Zombieland movie, our heroes - Tallahassee, Wichita, Columbus and Little Rock - are enjoying life in the White House. Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.The first Zombieland, released in 2009, was great. The plot was a bit random (though its rambling nature had a certain charm) but it was the dialogue that made it so good: very funny and delivered perfectly. Some other great comedic devices rounded off a very funny movie.Zombieland: Double Tap follows in these footsteps with some great lines and comedic moments. Woody Harrelson (as Tallahassee), Emma Stone (Wichita), Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) are in fine form again. Zoey Deutch is great as the beautiful but dim-witted Madison.The film does struggle a bit towards the end though. For 80% of its duration it was a great comedy with very little ambition to be a serious zombie-drama but towards the end it starts to take itself too seriously. What follows is a fairly conventional and flat period of action-drama. Almost made me knock the film down to a 7. Stuck with the 8, but a weak 8."
"I can't believe someone recommended Zombieland: Double Tap to me, much better than the original they said. It doesn't go anywhere interesting at all, the hell?The original's a popcorn flick, but decent. This is just more of the same, without any character development. It's too damn self-aware and Jesse Eisenberg's just bloody annoying. The Luke Wilson, Thomas Middleditch and Rosario Dawson part's just crap."
"'This film tells the story of a young female FBI agent, who goes to a remote, snow covered Indian territory to investigate the death of a young woman.Wind River has a slow pace, in keeping with the icy cold environment and the grim topic. It tells why the hunter wants to help, and fortunately he does help work the investigation. It is a chilling take, because I could hardly believe the reaction of those at the workplace just outside the trailer. The community is depicted to be very unsafe, with many members of the community in jail or deserving to go to jail. Life is hard, just to keep living is hard too.'"
"'Another bad chick feminist flick with stupid characters,bad fights and weak script and dialogue but all of that was already expected'"
"'Back in March 2020 of the votes here on IMDb for this movie, a bit over 25% are 1 votes from immature viewers. Now in August 2020 that has gone down a bit under 20% as wiser viewers add reasonable ratings. If you ignore the bogus 1 votes and look at the distribution of other votes, the greatest number are 6 with 5 as a close second. So 5.5 is probably the best rating, which is exactly in the middle of a 1 to 10 point rating system. In other words an average movie.While this movie isn\'t great in the grand scheme of things it is pretty well made and entertaining. There are several surprises along the way, many crosses and double crosses. You get to where you don\'t really know who the good guys are. It is girl-centered, there is nothing wrong with that.I am a long-time Charlie\'s Angel fan, back to the original TV days. While this version is quite a deviation from the original concept it is interesting to see what they did. I\'d more likely say inspired by Charlie\'s Angels with elements of James Bond and Jason Bourne thrown in.Good entertaining movie. My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. It has a great soundtrack, both in music and sound effects, you need a sound system with a good powered subwoofer to appreciate all of it.'"
"'After being fired from his own band, the guitar player Dewey Finn (Jack Black) needs to raise some money to pay for his rent and his bills. When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly (Mike White) is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called Battle of Bands to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.The School of Rock is a very funny and politically incorrect comedy tailored for Jack Black. He steals the movie and rocks in the role of a rock-and-roll lover, who dreams to be successful as a guitar player. Most of the lines belong to him, and I believe this movie is his best individual performance in his successful career. Joan Cusack is excellent as usual, and Miranda Cosgrove seems to have potential and be a great promise as actress. The soundtrack is a great homage to rock-and-roll, with many classics including Led Zeppelin\'s Immigrant Song. The DVD is full of worthwhile Extras, and in the end this film is an excellent funny entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Escola de Rock (School of Rock)'"
"The Farrelly brothers have some serious hits under their belt: Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal and Stuck on You. They took somewhat of a writing break between Heartbreak Kid and this movie, Hall Pass. I think they got rusty.There was the typical Farrelly humor with strong and explicit sexual references but very little humor beyond that. I don't know if the movie was poorly written, poorly executed or just a bad idea altogether but I did not like it.The cast were A listers: Owen Wilson, Christina Applegate and the up and coming Jason Sudeikis, yet there was no synergy between them. Furthermore, I think Owen Wilson was outside of his element. I don't think Owen Wilson has much range as and actor. Some roles fit him and others don't; this role didn't fit him. I first saw Jason Sudeikis in Horrible Bosses and I was impressed. I don't think he did a bad job in this movie, but I stopped it during the Jason Sudeikis self-pleasuring scene. The movie was already teetering on mediocrity before that and that scene did it for me.The Farrelly brothers are superb writers and I'm sure they'll bounce back, but this was a swing and a miss. Dumb and Dumber To is coming out soon, I really hope they put their all into it to make it as classic as the first."
"'The Farrelly Brothers are some talented names. Their body of work, includes cult-classics, that remain popular amongst, almost, all age groups. I personally am a fan of theirs, and \'Hall Pass\', which is co-written, produced & directed by them, is a decent flick, that manages some earnest laughs in the goings-on.\'Hall Pass\' stars Owen Wilson & Jason Sudeikis, who show their wives restlessness at home, so much, their wives grant them a hall pass, one week of freedom to do whatever they want... no questions asked.The idea is interesting and funny, and the Screenplay by Bobby & Peter Farrelly, Pete Jones & Kevin Barnett, succeeds by holding your interest in the first hour and brings in a host of good jokes. The second hour, loses grip and reaches to a not-so funny climax. The Writing in the second hour, definitely could have been much better.The Farrelly Brothers have directed the film nicely. Cinematography is up-to the mark, while the Editing is average. Performance-Wise: Owen Wilson is superb. He looks the part and delivers in every sequence. Jason Sudeikis is alright. Jenna Fischer is very good. Christina Applegate also does well. Richard Jenkins is Fantastic in a brief role. Alexandra Daddario is adequate. Others lend good support.On the whole, Though not Hilarious, this comedy still manages some genuine laughs, that make you laugh even after your done watching it.'"
"There's a moment in Guardians of the Galaxy when Rocket, the film's talking raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), is accused of faking his laugh; coincidentally, there were quite a few people in the cinema I went to who I could have hurled the same accusation at. Yes, GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments, but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However, even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments, this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun, delivering enough weird and wonderful characters, fantastic worlds, spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time. Director James Gunn's eclectic and vibrant universe is brimming with such imagination and visual splendour, all accompanied by a poptastic '70s/'80s soundtrack, that the film proves a treat for the senses despite its obvious shortcomings elsewhere."
"'James Gunn co-writes and directs this fantasy piece based on the Marvel comic book. Two hours of extremely exciting action, adventure, drama, comedy, inspiring cinematography and unbelievable CGI.

Reilly and Glenn Close. Plus the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel.'"
"'I think I saw the first Thor movie. All of these superhero movies blend together in my mind. I know I missed some of them, because there was clearly plot exposition that probably would have made Thor: Ragnarok make more sense. Oh well, these movies don\'t make much sense even if you have seen them all. They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they\'re over and hope you\'ll be so dazzled that you\'ll forget any crappy parts. It\'s harder and harder for me to watch movies like this and get past the weapon fetishism they all wallow in -- there\'s such an emphasis on how cool you look wielding your big gun, the bigger the better. In the increasingly disturbing American gun culture, it\'s no longer possible (for me at least) to shrug stuff like this off as only a movie. But whatever...I acknowledge that I probably shouldn\'t be watching movies like this in the first place if that\'s going to bother me.As for the rest? It\'s pretty funny, it doesn\'t take itself too seriously, and it\'s got Cate Blanchett looking sexy as hell in a dominatrix outfit (that is, until she puts on a ridiculous hat that makes her look like one of Satan\'s reindeer). I got tired of it, but as you might have gathered if you\'ve stayed with this review, I\'m probably not the target audience for it.Grade: B'"
"It's very clear that the MCU was greatly influenced by the success of Deadpool. What do I mean by that? Well, Deadpool was largely a comedy with action or an action comedy (however you choose to define it) and it seems that Thor: Ragnarok followed the same mold (less the abundant profanity).The question is: did it work? Judging by the amount of laughter I heard in the packed theater... yes. As for myself... not so much. It was entertaining and I did chuckle a few times myself, but I could have sufficed with fewer laughs and a little more substance. I was not that impressed with the nemesis, Hela (Cate Blanchett), with no onus on Cate because she's great. Hela just wasn't an interesting enough or captivating enough foe. And while I have generally loved Hulk's roles in the two Avenger movies, he was too cartoonish in Thor: Ragnarok. I mean he was literally more cartoonish instead of the more lifelike look he had in the other movies and he was more cartoonish in his behavior.I love the crossovers that Marvel does now (adding other Marvel characters) and that does boost its overall enjoyment value. There were some added characters around Thor in this movie that was nice. But boiling the movie down to the story and the execution of that story, it was more ehh. It was still entertaining and a fun night at the movies but not MCU good."
"CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff."
"Kong is being kept under-the-dome living on Skull Island and he's not happy about it. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is trying to keep him safe and away from Godzilla. Her adopted deaf daughter Jia communicates with him. Meanwhile, conspiracy blogger Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is investigating and working at Apex Cybernetics. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.Honestly, I don't remember the previous movies. I don't know any of these characters. Non of them really matters anyways. I do like the idea of the little girl communicating with Kong. The movie should do more of that. BTH is a little fun as the conspiracy nut. His little Scooby gang has potential but it's not that great. The Hollow Earth is rather silly but whatever. It's stupid but kinda cool at the same time. The TRON ships are out of place. It's a tech mishmash. I don't really need a lot of the human story especially if it's not doing anything interesting. At the end of the day, this is a mindless popcorn flix and it's fine for being that."
"'They took the Kong from Skull Island, an excellent film plus the recent less than excellent Godzilla film and smashed them together into a confused mess. They simply tried to do too much. They take the basic titan fight and added Journey to the Center of the Earth, Upside Down Kong as Indian Jones, Transformers, a light saber Ax, teens save the world, and a little girl saves the world. The company Apex are the bad guys who are trying to do something good. Good visuals. Just a messed up plot.'"
"GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love. I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit. There are flashes of strong material, including a very nasty gore scene, but they come few and far between."
"Super duper boring and useless. not poorly made, but i just didn't care. finished it reluctantly. very symbolism-y and metaphorical. and some very questionable decisions. netflix needs to stop making movies (1 viewing)"
"This was an unexpected gem. I guessed I had heard a few good things about it, but I expected something at least decent. The film is actually very good, with a fantastic lead performance at its core. The premise is a simple one that could have not worked at all, but the film is crafted with such care by Mike Flanagan and it really shows. The only flaw I would point out would be the final scenes. Something about their execution didn't work completely for me. Other than that, definitely a film to be recommended."
"'Not a fan of the first movie, and this is even worse. The whole plot just seems like an excuse for several well-choreographed but dull fight scenes in slow motion, complete with impossible moves and such. Quite dull and pointless.'"
"The special-effects in this sci-fi techno are as wild as in the first film in this trilogy. However, I thought this was the least appealing of the three films. The action scenes were stupid and too repetitive (too much of the same kind of action.) Yet, to point out the good as well as the bad, the car chase was spectacular. The film also went on a bit too long. It would have been better with some of those action scenes lessened.I had heard the story was very poor, but I didn't find it that bad. However, there is too much technical talk. Who can understand half of the mumbo-jumbo espoused in here?"
"For many 'The Holiday' has joined the ranks of Christmas classic's in terms of films. I wish them well with this but for me this is an average film that is made marginally better by an all-star cast, who seem to be having a better time than the audience.It's trying to be like 'Love Actually', it's trying to be sweet and romantic, but in the end I just didn't buy into Jack Black's character, or the one played by Kate Winslet.It has it's moments, but for me they are far and few between in an overly long film that could've been over and done with in 90 minutes tops.But it's Christmas, we are kinder to films that are trying to entertain us. Even if this one tries too hard."
"'Another serial killer movie more Se7en than Zodiac but nowhere near as fresh as either despite having three Oscar-winning actors heading the cast. An unusually subdued Denzel Washington is the slightly grizzled older cop, (been there, done that), Rami Malek is the young detective desperate to shake off any resemblance to Freddie Mercury and Jared Leto is the probable killer. It\'s a slow, handsome-looking film, so determined not to be sensational that it veers towards the dull side. The writer and director is John Lee Hancock so I guess the blame lies largely with him.Denzel\'s character, the great detective whose intuation is almost superhuman, is a cliche too far; he\'s now the right age to channel his inner Morgan Freeman while Malek is just sleep-walking through his role. Leto, however, is outstanding, giving the movie a much needed kick as well as a touch of class, acting his co-stars off the screen though that fine and underrated actor Terry Kinney gives a lift to his few scenes as Malek\'s boss. Still, despite the cast and John Schwartzman\'s superb cinematography this could be just another episode of C.S.I. Crime Scene. A real disappointment.'"
"What was that??? this movie makes you appreciate things in movies that you normally take for granted. so many aspects of this movie are incompetent. the musical score is almost non-existent except for one theme they use during scene transitions. the story, which is already completely basic, is told in such an awkward and discombobulated way. so many things were confusing, not because they were too complex, but because they just didn't flow right.but the worst parts of this movie were a combination of the editing and the dialogue. it was soooooo awkward throughout. there were numerous times where i couldn't tell who was talking. there were scenes where one person was talking but the sound and volume completely changed between sentences. and the strangest thing was the flow of the conversations. the pauses between characters speaking was so odd. it's like they wanted to have fast quippy conversations, but they accomplished this by cutting out the gaps between responses. one character would respond IMMEDIATELY after the other finished his line. it sounded so unnatural. i repeated so many parts to confirm. it happened throughout the movie.other than being an extremely low-quality movie in every aspect except the cast, this movie was just boring with zero intrigue that goes nowhere interesting. (1 viewing, 2/6/2021)"
"The Little Things is the worst film Denzel's been involved in, unless he did a comedy with Kevin Hart of course.I don't even know what this is... they both killed someone, the end. This Malek guy's terrible, he just stares the whole time, like one of Michael Shannon's expressions. I fear for the upcoming Bond film he'll be in, the weak dialogue and woeful direction didn't help. Jim gets into the car and then does whatever Albert wants him to do until he becomes enraged. Albert could have killed him at any time as well. Such an empty nothing of a film."
"Actually it would be more, don't yell anything or a word, but you get what I'm saying anyway. This builds tension and has a very succesful part towards the end of the movie. But the build is a bit ... well yes there is a shock moment with which the movie begins. Something that while you kind of expect it, you still may be baffled they went with it.Having said, after that punch in the gut, we get a slower pace and approach, but with quite a few holes in the story or rather the way the characters interact. Maybe it's good for the tension not to have a soundproof room, but when it comes to logic, you do wonder how suicidal that makes the characters ... Also a big reveal towards the end might make you go: Really? No one else discovered this? For fans this may feel like nitpicking and let's be clear, this is a good movie overall. But having so many things that feel convinient and don't make too much sense, take a bit away from the greatness the movie could have had - imho that is of course. Still a sequel is coming - surprise surprise (not)"
"In the tiny town of Centerville, Police Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) confront Hermit Bob (Tom Waits). Officer Mindy Morrison (ChloÃ« Sevigny) is the other police officer. Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton) is the weird new mortician. Farmer Miller (Steve Buscemi) and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) are two of the locals having breakfast at the diner. Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler), and Zack (Luka Sabbat) are passing through the town. Strange things are happening. The earth is off its axis blamed on polar fracking. Then zombies.Director Jim Jarmusch is trying for a meta hipster zombie comedy. It's a more dead-pan and less funny Shaun of the Dead. I'm not his biggest fan and I often rate his films a step lower than the critics. His sense of humor is a little too hip for me. This one is simply trying for fun. It's not trying to be that smart. Bill Murray is perfect for the dead-pan especially without the anger to taint it. The cast is talented and they're having fun. It really translates onto the screen. There are a few truly hilarious scenes. A sword welding Tilda Swinton is super fun when joined with the three small town cops. Sure there is a Star Wars joke but it's so awkwardly done that it's meta hilarious. This is one of the few Jarmusch film that I like much more than the general critical community. I'm just not highbrow like that."

"'There is no real relationship, no depth of backstory on the characters. However, it is well photographed - in other words it doesn\'t look like the cheap porn movies they were making in Boogie Nights, which was a first class film about the porn industry. This is just a soft core porn biology lesson, plain and simple. Another movie in a similar vein was The Lover, which was was much better done than this. Sure, The Lover had hot sex scenes, but it had character development and atmosphere too. This film would make sex seem boring to teenage boys. I didn\'t read the book, so I can\'t speak to how true it is to it, but if it did follow it closely, I can\'t imagine how the book could have been a success. Avoid and don\'t waste your time.'"
"Humanity could be in peril. Twelve black oval alien pods appear in twelve different parts of the world like Denmark and Shanghai...in America, the alien vessel hovers in Montana. Military leaders will seek the assistance of a brilliant young linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) in an attempt to communicate with the extraterrestrials. Who, why, what? Where do they come from; why are they here and what do they want? The linguist will need the aid of global military minds played by Forest Whitaker, Jeremy Renner, Mark O'Brien, Michael Stuhlbarg and Tzi Ma.There is suspense and wonderment watching intelligent language being created. Creative scenery and Miss Adams is outstanding in what could have been a dull role."
"Could it be that the less sense a movie makes, the better it's ranking here on IMDb? As I write this, the film is #93 on IMDb's Top #250. I've already ranted enough in other reviews to explain my position on this regarding new releases, so I won't bore you with it here. My main problem with the picture is that there doesn't seem to be an inherent logic to the story line. Linguist Louise Brooks (Amy Adams) makes significant inroads into understanding an alien language configured in Rorschach-like circles, and as the viewer, we're never really privy to how she managed to do it. The non-linear time element introduced into the story is quite bewildering as well, highlighted by Adams' character placing a phone call to a Chinese general AFTER he showed her his phone number, some time in the FUTURE! There are going to be those who hail this movie as brilliant film making, but I have to tell you, if I have to have it explained to me, then it doesn't pass a basic test for telling a good story. Namely a picture with a solid beginning, middle and end."
"Took me a while to see this one but my wife saw it on a plane and said it was okay. I waited so long because the further we go into Spielberg movies the less I do like them. They are more ane more into a Disney fairytale. But when my father-in-law presented this on 3D to watch I did give it a try.Starts off rather good with a lot of action going on, espescially the race with all those features that you will recognise when you are into gaming. But once that was over I didn't get a grip on this flick. It just didn't got my attention. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad but it isn't vintage Spielberg for me.But they also told me to watch in in 3D because it do adds and I agree. Due computer animation they were able to exaggerate the 3D effects. They were stunning. Especially when they are in the virtual world. But again, I will forget this movie rather quickly for a Spielberg flick.But teens will love this and gamers will love this, that I can assure you.Gore 0/5\nNudity 0/5\nEffects 5/5\nStory 2,5/5\nComedy 0/5"

"I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good."
Most of the low ratings are from low balls and total unrelated revenge. This series is best series we have watched in at least last one year. Brilliant acting by all and absolutely well plot story and it touches most important topic of our country. Watch it and you won't regret a second.
'I like the bit how nobody has watches anymore.even old people'
"Let me state right off the bat that I like both Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I loved them both in Wedding Crashers. That was a very funny movie. This one, not so much, and because it's rated PG-13 and not R, there isn't as much raunch as in WC. Actually, this one is supposed to be even more of a nice vibe between comedy and sweetness than WC and I actually liked that. But I'd be lying if I didn't say that I didn't find much that was funny during many of the beginning scenes. It did pick up much near the end and overall, The Internship wasn't too bad. Part of me wouldn't even mind seeing it again if asked. Just don't expect a non-stop laugh-getter is all I'm sayin'..."
"The beautiful Anna is rescued from a seedy boyfriend and a future of petty crime by the KGB, who deck her out as a model and put her to work as an assassin. But Anna wants out - could the CIA provide her with an exit route?If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Nikita, anyone? As an action/suspense thriller, Anna is fine, if unoriginal. It is a simple story, needlessly complicated by unnecessary and confusing flashbacks - Five Years Ago, Two weeks Ago, Three Years ago... only a couple of these flashbacks actually need to be flashbacks in that they contain a payoff which would spoil a chronologically subsequent moment.Newcomer Sasha Luss is decorative, deals well with the action, and shoots more people than John Wick. The rest of the cast are reliable, although Luke Evans has an air of feeling miscast."
"After a flaccid opening half-hour, this slick, globe-trotting rehash by Luc Besson of his earlier hit 'Nikita' nostalgically set in the dying days of the Cold War develops an extremely dry sense of humour with the entrance of Helen Mirren (real name Mironoff) having a rare old time in ugly spectacles as the chain-smoking love child of Quasimodo and Rosa Klebb; and the beginning of the killing spree that comprises most of the rest of the film.The violence - as is usual with Besson - is sexier than the sex, and the film manages the odd surprise with the aid of an interesting flashback structure, with Mirren satisfyingly getting the last word."
"Italy, 1983. Elio, the 17-year-old son of an academic finds himself attracted to his father's research assistant, Oliver.I was expecting this to be your usual schmaltzy, predictable romantic drama, just with a same-sex couple. However, it is better than that. The scene-setting and plot development are good and the characters engaging. There's a nice ebb and flow to the build-up to the relationship. Great scenery and cinematography too.Unfortunately, the groundwork is negated to an extent by the last third or so of the movie, where it does become a fairly standard romantic drama. The conclusion is not overly profound nor original either.Overall, watchable but it seemed headed for something more powerful and profound."
"'Jordan Peele has been famous as part of the comedy team Key & Peele. It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie, but he did. And his Get Out is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire. Basically, it\'s a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still won\'t accept blacks as their equals. Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry\'s songs but would\'ve refused to let him come into their businesses? I don\'t know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but I won\'t deny that it\'s one of the cleverest things that I\'ve seen all year. A mixture of horror, drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama\'s election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).Good movie.'"
"This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining."
"'I don\'t think the movie is as great as the ratings show. But it is still pretty original and entertaining. I just feel it wasn\'t developed enough and a lot could have been done better. I think the acting was really good. And it did a great job developing the paranoia in the beginning, it just went downhill when we were supposed to find out what happened.I don\'t think the movie is racist. People whining about it are just as bad as SJWs who see racism everywhere.'"
"boy,what a let down this movie was.i viewed the unrated version,which promised more sex,more skin,more laughs.from what i saw,there was very little skin here,not much sex,either,and zero laughs.Elisha Cuthbert is nice,but she can't make up for how disappointing this movie was.you can tell the movie had some intelligent thought behind it,and wasn't just going for bottom of the barrel comedy.unfortunately,something got lost in the translation for me,as the jokes weren't funny.in fact,i found the movie bland.though this version was unrated,the original version was rated R by the MPAA.in Canada,it was 18A,except for Ontario,which was 14A.i happen to agree withe 14A rating.for me,that's what it should have been rated,including the unrated version.my best advice,if you're a parent,is to pre screen the movie,and decide if you children are mature enough for it.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 5/10"
"Diddy (Emma Bercovici) is a little girl who lives in Detroit and wants to be a surfer. Mom decides to break into homes with two other guys, Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) her boyfriend to get the money to go to California. They are good at their job, then make it look like kids did it.They see an easy mark of a blind veteran who got a lot of money in a settlement, except he never leaves his house and has a Rottweiler. The threesome break into the house and discover a heavily locked room which contains...This is not exactly your formula break-in and you don't want to give a shoot first blind man a break. Good performance by Emma Bercovici who carried the film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity, just that bulb thing."
"To pay off a debt, small-time pot dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) agrees to smuggle a shipment of marijuana across the border from Mexico; in order to raise less suspicion, he assembles a fake family, comprising of stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) as his wife, neighbour Kenny (Will Poulter) as his nerdy son, and homeless waif Casey (Emma Roberts) as his daughter.Okay, I'll admit itÂ like most male viewers (I suspect), my main reason for watching We're The Millers was to see Jennifer Aniston doing her well publicised striptease routine, but I actually found the film entertaining for several other reasons: while not all of the gags necessarily hit the mark, those that do are extremely funny and there are enough laughs throughout to make the trip with the 'Millers' worthwhile; the cast is extremely likable and work very well together; and although it's a tad clichÃ©, there is a fuzzy, feel-good factor about the whole thing despite the film being about drug smugglers.Although it's unlikely to make anyone's All-Time Top Ten Comedies list, We're The Millers is an enjoyable enough time waster with the added bonus of Aniston in her undies."
"Having seen quite a few of Wes Anderson's movies, I knew to expect a certain rhythm and flow concerning characterizations and story. So I knew that most of the characters will speak in a certain clipped tone that never wavers and certain jump cuts were also expected. Jumps in timeline was also expected as this one goes from 1985 to 1968 to much of the '30s. Most of the story concerns a character played by Ralph Finnes and his servant I'll refer to as Lobby Boy. I was quite amused by some of the lines and scenes and so was my mom who only asked a few questions about what was going on though she figured most of it out without my having to answer much of the time. So on that note, I highly recommend The Grand Budapest Hotel if you don't mind such an unusual experience of a noncommercial nature."
"Do not believe your eyes or let's not be deceived. Also do not lose your faith. Or maybe you're just a realist and finally see what's really what. What may sound like crazy talk is just me trying to prepare you for this movie. Because this may have been promoted as a horror movie in many countries (and the filmmaker knew this could get him into trouble, but also that distributors like to put things in boxes to promote them), it's more a folk-tale as the full title is suggesting.The movie is open to be interpreted any way you like. And it is also open to be viewed, liked or hated in any way the viewer sees fit. It will annoy a lot of people, but it also will delight a lot of people. It's not horror as I already said, but it is frightening if you get into the mood of it and let the movie do its job. Otherwise you'll be bored and won't enjoy any of it - you can tell very early on which will be the case ..."
"'This film is well made, and has a fairly engaging story. However, I find the pace too slow, and the static shots compound to the stillness that slows the film down.'"
"(Flash Review)Without researching or dwelling on the facts, as many reviewers have complained about, this story is weighty and engaging. An unwilling prince Henry V is thrust by fate to the throne after his younger brother, designated to reign, is killed in battle. Future King Henry V has vision for peace for England while being pressed to take large swathes of land by force by his father's inner circle; namely all of France for starters. When a peaceful approach fails, the new King prepares for battle. Will the outnumbered English be able to defeat France's mature army? When the dust has settled and the blood finished dripping, who can he trust to forge his early reign? The atmosphere is full of darkly lit scenes also devoid of color; muted when used. The story's tone is portrayed serious and gritty with heavy music painting the mood. The acting, editing and production were high quality. Take the story for what it is and it'll be enjoyable."
"'At last an opportunity to see TimothÃ©e Chalamet doing something a little grittier. Sadly, t\'was not to be. His portrayal of this great character from early 15th Century British history left me cold. He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, butter wouldn\'t melt image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn\'t really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by Bambi back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare light - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions.'"
'First this movie is over 2 hours of a story that is stretched out much too long. And not one of the characters is even approaching being interesting.Second the cinematography is so dark it should have been recorded in black & white.Third 90% of the actors speak as if they are all coming down with laryngitis!Forth the story in itself is just a bore and I cannot see any public interest in it outside of the people that thrive on Medieval European history.Good luck if you choose to suffer this movie.'
"I didn't watch a gem, nor a great movie, not even for this genre so excuse me if I don't have the same opinion as the people that thought it was an exceptional movie. It's watchable, that I'll admit, there is a bit of suspense, but other than that it's just not a movie I would keep in my collection. Horror and comedy can work but in this case I would just have skipped the comedy part. It was unnecessary and to be honest not that funny. The acting was good for some but bad for others, so even that was disappointing. I read somewhere reviewers comparing it to Get Out, really? If you never seen that one I recommend you that movie. Get Out has everything this movie doesn't have. That's a good movie and not this one."

"'Without a doubt, Frances McDormand has been one of the greatest US actresses of the past three decades. Humble and unglamorous, she\'s the opposite of the stereotypical movie star, making her Oscar wins all that more important. So it\'s no surprise that she now stars in ChloÃ© Zhao\'s Nomadland, as a laid-off woman traversing the western US. McDormand put so much effort into the role that many of her co-stars - many of whom aren\'t professional actors - didn\'t know that they were working with a professional actress.I\'ve heard of ChloÃ© Zhao for a few years, but this is the first movie of hers that I\'ve seen. I now want to see her other movies. This is simply an excellent movie. The performances, as well as the use of visuals combine to create a look at the effects that the Great Recession had on countless people. Everyone should see this movie.'"
"'Directors Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clement also star in this low budget mockumentary of a group of vampires sharing a house in modern day New Zealand.They argue about housework, they have a slave who do various tasks for them including getting victims round for dinner and some blood.The vampires hit the town at night to go to nightclubs to maybe find victims for blood, but they really are the oldest rockers in town ill suited to the 21st century.They also fall foul of other mutants such as a pack of werewolves that they can smell from a mile off.Waititi & Clement have fun picking apart the vampire conventions, checking for daylight the first thing to do when they wake up in the evening, make sure the blood of the victims do not get everywhere when the victims are attacked, even hypnotism and flying.Things take a turn when a victim called Nick becomes a vampire. He invites a human friend to stay with them. Nick also boasts to strangers that he is a vampire which leads to Petyr, the oldest vampire to being killed.For vampire Viago it is also a sad love story who followed his true love but got posted elsewhere.The film is a good combination of absurdness, humour and horror which can be bloody. However the comedy is rather one note.'"
'The world is split into five parts named after a dragon. It is in ruins and dying as druuns (purple Death Eaters) are turning people to stone. Princess Raya must play Tomb Raider to recover the gems and save the world. But first she must find the dragon. It won\'t be easy as no one wants to give up their piece of the gem.The film is only mildly Asian in tradition. The language is modern English slang. Raya\'s eyes are almost round. Sisu (the villain) has more slanted eyes. Doesn\'t Disney know to end the stereotype? The ending reminded me a little of Guardians of the Galaxy minus the dance off.'
"Remakes are a part of Hollywood, but even by Hollywood standards, remaking a film just over a decade after it was released is odd.But that's what happens here, with Marc Webb being charged with the responsibility of remaking the original Sam Rami film for a new (or slightly older) audience.Unfortunately there's only so many ways that you can tell the origin of Peter Parker becoming Spiderman, so in many ways this is just a carbon copy of what Rami and co had done actually quite successfully a decade earlier, and it means that audiences are playing compare and contrast throughout.Sally Field wasn't great as Aunt May, Martin Sheen was better as Uncle Ben. I didn't much care for Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker though, he seemed too cool for the role.The break out star though is Emma Stone, and it's a shame she's not in in it more.A fairly harmless remake, but you can't help but think that this has been done better before...because it has."
"'The trilogy of the Spider-Man by Sam Raimi is very faithful to the comic book\'s hero from my childhood. The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie, but is a fast-paced reinvention of the hero and therefore I was a little disappointed with the story.Peter Parker is no longer the outcast nerd that is bullied by everyone at high-school and needs to work to support his beloved Aunt May. He dates Gwen and immediately discloses his identity to her. After discovering that he has superpowers, he immediately jumps from the top of a building in a reckless attitude. He does not also grieve the loss of his Uncle Ben. There are many other differences regarding the original Spider-Man.The best that this film offers are the top-notch special effects that are very impressive. The story is only reasonable and I prefer Sam Raimi\'s movies. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): O Espetacular Homem-Aranha (The Spectacular Spider- Man)'"
"Spoilers herein.I'm very easy to please when it comes to stuff like this, especially if it successfully and visually builds a world of mood. I give special consideration to first-time competence, and am especially interested in projects Barrymore sponsors. I love time folding, self-reference and narrative challenges. I really enjoy films whose narrative depends on other films, ideally classics.And yet this film failed me, because of reliance on two devices that really annoy. The first is the embedded parody on 70-80's teen flicks. This is simply hackneyed by now. I could take it in 'Ghost World,' in 'Go,' even in 'Ginger Snaps.' But here it is simply a crutch with nothing new and much that is old.The other annoyance -- rather a barrier to endearment -- is the heavihanded symbolism. I gladly swallowed it in 'American Beauty,' more eagerly in 'Fight Club,' and reluctantly with 'Magnolia.' But here, it is so heavihanded only a teenager could not think it unsophisticated. And this in a film quoting Graham Greene!"
"'Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a paranoid schizophrenic anti-social teenager having therapy with Dr. Lilian Thurman (Katharine Ross) and using medication. He has visions of a giant rabbit, Frank, the Fuzzy Bunny, who instructs him to make violent acts, like destroying the fire hydrant and piping to flood his high-school like in Graham Greene\'s book, which text was read in his English class, or burning to the ground the house of the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze). Donnie is not at home when an engine turbine falls of a plane into his bedroom without any explanation. He predicts the doomsday and is very interested in time travel through the wormhole.Donnie Darko is one of the weirdest cult movies ever. Richard Kelly follows the same school of David Lynch, making a very intriguing movie with the usual elements of this director, such as in The Lost Highway, using characters very bizarre and dark. The story is confusing and quite nonsense but holds the attention until the very end, with great cast and performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Donnie DarkoNote: On 16 November 2014, I saw this movie again.'"
"'I HATED this movie. it is awful. all of the scariness from this horror movie comes from the unsettling. it\'s gross for the sake of being gross. it\'s not scary at all. it\'s really weird and annoying and terrible. the only good thing is the main theme song they play a few times, and i\'m pretty sure it\'s the biggest reason i thought the trailer was intriguing. based on the movie, i believe the director has the following fetishes... (1 viewing)\nSPOILERS\n...gay fetish, necrophilia, incest, sex with animals, cannibalism, urinating on yourself. not to mention all the dead animals, autopsies and disemboweling cows... smh. all to unsettle the audience. u suck'"
"This is a Battle Royale situation where the rich hunt the poor but with the added twist that it speaks about polarized America, liberal elites against Sean Hannity rednecks. Given the template, we know we are not going to have to really know any of these people except as fodder in a game we watch. Stereotypes are mined often. The tone is gleeful, poking fun in passing rather than overtly serious, and I would rather have it this way. It's a light-hearted jab at a really broken historical moment.But as with other concept movies, after the raft of initial surprises of world are peeled off, I'm left with the same ordinary scenes of action, shootouts and fistfights. It trails off near the end, having nowhere left to go. The idea, spelled out for us at the end, is that the level of enmity and suspicion of the other runs so high, stories of how deplorable the other is give rise to the real thing. Both sides end up being kidnapped into the story."
"Some Fun can be had Watching this Messy Movie if One Doesn't Try and Figure Out WTF is Going On in its Daft Definition of Social-Media and Politics.It Name-Drops Buzz-Words and Memes to Grab its Audience.Trying to Point Out the Absurdity that is Our Current Paradigm of Divisiveness that Controls Behavior, Attitudes, and New-Speak in Today's Ludicrous Landscape.Getting a Handle on Most of What Goes On Behind the Blood-Drenched Ballyhoo Presented in this Pretentious Picture is a Challenge.Suffice to Say, Forget the Intellectual Debate.Because the Wit is in Short-Supply and the Script is Sophomoric at Best.The Ideas are Dumbed-Down for the Lowest Common Denominator with Extreme Stereotypical Characters.Everyone Acts Smarter than They are and Everyone Exhibits Loathsome Behavior.Misses the Mark its Shooting for by a Mile.Except in its Exhibition and Exploitation of Gore-Movie Red-Stuff.That's the Aforementioned Fun that this Movie Offers and for that it's...Worth a Watch."
"Lara Croft is the daughter of Richard Croft, a famous adventurer who disappeared several years ago. Now she finds clues to what her father was searching for when he disappeared and is determined to follow his path. She heads to East Asia, where adventure and danger await.Formulaic and dull. I wasn't a fan of the original Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie, but this is worse. Pretty much your standard action-adventure movie, complete with basic plot, supernatural elements, a search for a lost kingdom and all sorts of perils. It's Indiana Jones / Raiders of the Lost Ark, dumbed down massively."
"When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5."
"'This film very closely follows the plot of the original classic. An all American family gets stranded in the middle of nowhere (New Mexico desert here) and are attacked by a family ravaged by nuclear radiation.I\'m no fan of the first one. I thought it was stupid, unpleasant with lousy special effects and acting. Well this one is STILL stupid but more unpleasant, the gore has been upped to an incredible degree (this was edited to get an R rating) and the acting is much better. But--that makes it harder to watch. The acting is so good that I was horrified (and not in a good way) by what I was seeing. Seeing a normal American family attacked and tortured and killed AND acting like it\'s really happening can get to you. It didn\'t scare me--it just disgusted me.Also, surprisingly, this was pretty boring. The graphic gore is in small, but powerful, doses. It\'s surrounding by boring dialogue and one endless sequence when one man wanders all over a deserted town. It\'s not creepy or chilling--just dull. It was so dull that when the violence kicked back in I was so bored it had no effect. Also a good portion of the audience walked out--in boredom.So if u liked the first one you MIGHT like this one. Otherwise--stay away. I give it a 5.'"
"'The only thing that comes to mind watching this debacle Is Kate Bosworth, the one recognizable actress in this B-ensamble. I remembered I couldnt stop gazing at her beautiful face and charisma In Blue Crush.\nThat was many many years ago. I loved that movie growing up. Were exactly the same age. Now she Finally revisit the beach life and maybe this time the Magic of Kate would come back.. after many many years of failed b-movies i truly hoped for a return.\nBut no..\nIncredible boring miniserie without any feelings or direction.'"
"Apparently, everyone watched Lost and are comparing this to it. I didn't, so I'm watching it for itself.Is this the best show? No. But it is bingeable and I did because I wanted to see what would happen and ultimately what was going on.I liked the main female character and couldn't understand why everyone was on her case. I also liked the black make character. Everyone else either made little impression or I couldn't stand them. The KC woman was the real troublemaker and the guy who did try to rape her was also one. Not sorry when he got stabbed. KC could go next.If she was finding things, then maybe they should have been looking for things like she did.People binge shows for two reason -kill time or because the series is great.This show will kill an afternoon."
"The first 2,episodes have Alex Pettyfyr prancing about in i'll fitting trousers and I guess he wanted a big role because the pace is slow enough without being sidelined by this assault story. TV has to move fast and by the time the characters begin to form dimensions you've long since stopped caring anyway. The characters being the usual mix you'd find in any teen slasher flick. the dialogue takes a stab at a certain naturalness- often feeling improvised as scenes can go on and on with bickering and questionable justifications. In the end it's okaaaay but it's full of the oddest montages, bizarre reasoning, suddenly changing motivations, weird long tangents - just hmmmm\n-"
"'The first episode was somewhat intriguing, the second less so and by episode 5 it was boring of the same stuff over and over again. A confusing change in episode 6 going into 7 where it eventually reached a conclusion and all was revealed. Not a good story but somewhat different.If you have nothing to do, perhaps it helps you pass the time, but by not watching it you have missed nothing! However, I cannot agree that it is terrible as most reviewers allege.'"
This review contains spoilers.The I-Land is a Netflix produced show that premiered in 2019. The series is about a group of death row inmates that find themselves in a simulation to redeem themselves.The I-Land Season OneThe I-Land's first season is an overall disaster. This season has many problems that were apparent in the first episode. The series has almost all unlikable characters. The only likable character was Moses as he is actually able to be a good person in the simulation. Even his crime was involuntary manslaughter as he did not want to cause harm to people. This character was killed off in an awful way with Cooper accidentally shooting Moses. The actor for this character aws also enjoyable to watch as he made the series more light-hearted. The other characters in this series are awfully antagonistic. The I-Land inhabitants do not seem to want to get along or even discover the mystery of why they are in the I-Land.The first season fails in telling a cohesive story. There are many inconsistencies across the entire series. One of these is K.C. having a stab wound on her that is continued into the I-Land. Cooper has facial scarring that is not carried into the I-Land. This inconsistency is never explained in the series.I would not recommend 'The I-Land'. The series has so bad it is good moments but these are not enough to make the series watchable.Grade: D
'All series hold the audiance. Only the main carector stund and acting not suitable to ACP. Accent also not good that why i disappointed'
'Too lengthy and dragged story. Action is good. Thrill is missing. Storyline is flawed.'
'Swara you are lucky to get plots but you fail to deliverugly scenes which makes you irritatelittle twist you can see in the last 2 episodesgirls are running traffickers are catching and punishing themswara looks so funny as a ACP and speaks from her nose which sounds like cartoonswatch it if u like ham scenes'
"'Pretty average - there is nothing new in the story. The story is jerky and there is no effort made to flesh out any character. The lead moves around in anger and arrogance without reason. The bad guys are generic bad guys, the dialogue switches from okay to plain bad.\nThere are other good shows around, this can be given a pass (special ops, family man, she etc..)'"
"'I am not the target audience for this series. Because of that, I am not going to give the show a score--just talk about it and what other \'oldsters\' like me might think of it.Over the Garden Wall is a cartoon movie that\'s been split into 10 segments. Because of this, you may just want to watch it all at once. The story is about a boy (probably about 12-13 years-old) named Wirt and his little brother, Gregory. The story is about their weird quest to find their way home from a strange and magical land--which is sort of like a dystopian version of Wonderland. It\'s all very dark and EXTREMELY confusing. In fact, what it\'s all about isn\'t even apparent until episodes 9 and 10! In the interim, you\'ll no doubt be very confused. I say it\'s best NOT to try to think about what you\'re watching--just watch and enjoy the occasional laughs.So is it worth seeing? Well, yes if you have a VERY high tolerance for the strange and confusing. If you demand that the show explain itself and be normal, then don\'t watch. The story, while convoluted and weird, is worth while by the end. The background animations are very nice and there are a few familiar voices such as Elijah Wood and Christopher Lloyd. The bottom line is that it is nice to see Cartoon Network trying something different--and it certainly is different.'"
"The first few episodes weren't bad apart from Kidman's immobilized face which really affects her emotions which are now all the same. Unfortunately, too many of her closeups are featured.Grant, on the other hand is all the worst for wear, weary and ancient and downright sleazy. She playing a psychologist, and he an oncologist, really pushes the disbelief metre way too high.But OK, some of the bit part actors are great, including the sons and the lover and her husband.But all sorts of problems with reality. For one the kids being questioned without a social worker present. For two the kids in court seeing the murdered women, one her son? Please.The last two episodes it truly falls apart and we are troped and cliched to death, with obligatory car chase, helicopters, bridge jumper. It was painful to watch, like they ran out of all idea and let Grant and Kidman loose on each other without intervention from the cops surrounding them. Puhleese.No big reveal, just a pitiful whimper.A complete waste of time.3/10"
"'Although the plot is intense and includes several twists and turns, the post-crime activities of the wrongdoer are rather odd - bearing in mind the personÂ´s background, knowledge and an opportunity presented. Being so sloppy after such a crime with subsequent mood change? Not too realistic... I wonder if the novel behind (You Should Have Known by Jean Hanff Korelitz) is a total fiction?Still, due to the direction (highly valued Susanne Bier from Denmark) and magnificent performances of Nicole Kidman, Hugh Grant, Noah Jupe, Donald Sutherland, and Noma Dumezweni, above all, all the episodes were still pleasant to follow, plus the final scenes were different from a regular US series. Kidman should be praised somehow for being Grace Fraser - although she is always a splendid actress.'"

"As the episodes went on the more I thought about what's going on the dumber it got:\n1. Made no sense & a cheap scary hook of spirit/ghost having to turn door nobs to enter a room. If they had a physicality to them then where are they when not turning door nobs? Do they suddenly become unphysical? Sometimes they appear normal human like; other times obviously cosmetic dept. dead awhile dead.\n2. Another really cheap overdone scary hook are flashing room lights & the time worn flashlights suddenly don't work.\n3. The usual floating ceiling ghosts; the distant in the hallway ghosts; the creeping behind some piece of furniture ghosts; the dead suddenly opening eyes or sitting up; the predictable jump scare turn your head ghost.\n4. Excessive flashbacks that at times not only made the timelines (and there were many) confusing, but also disrupted any viewer connective storyline continuity.\n5. Lots of screen time filled w/staged acting; mostly focused on family squabbles & parents not believing the kids.Positive:\nNice old house."
This movie should have never been made. Terrible story. This movie should have been made in the 90's. Sanju Baba was good. Everyone else's performances were average. Songs were good. Direction was bad. Writing was bad. Scenes that should have been serious makes you laugh. Just skip this one.
"The saving grace of sadak 2 is sanjay dutt. There is an innocence in his character which makes him lovable on screen. The next best was jishu sengupta as the bad dad. The cinematography and production values were good.\nBut the story has nothing new to offer, script was predictable, the fake guru angle was just unnecessary if the main villain was aarya's dad and how badly they ruined makhrand deshpande's character in the climax where he runs as if a mice runs after seeing a cat. Its a depressing storyline on the lines of logan. But unlike logan, it doesn't hit you emotionally. Most of the supporting cast were wasted especially gulshan grover. Nobody's character was properly developed apart from sanjay, alia and jishu's. Alia hams unnecessarily in some scenes.\nOn the whole sadak 2 is flawed but not a very bad film for me. One time watchable."
"This movie was a complete waste of my time and energy trying to sit through every second, awful acting and misdirected plot. This movie also has more than a handful signs of a poorly portrayed propaganda. MAny of the happenings in the movie does not match the time period historically and has subliminal hate towards any who oppositions his beliefs. Even the title is horrible..Don't waste your time!"
"'This is an awful film with a single message to glorify Mr Recep Tayyip Erdogan. We are used to the poor quality of the Turkish movies but this particular one is probably the worst ever, not worth watching unless you want to subject yourself the most excruciating political torment of admiring him at any expense. I wish there were an option of rating it zero star.'"
Waste of time and space. Nothing to see here.I guess it's the most disliked movie I've ever seen. The score speaks for itself.
Only saw this once or twice - I don't remember - many years ago; haven't been interested in seeing it again since there was a time when I was younger and I slightly enjoyed dumb movies but this went to deep into stupidity. That's about it - nothing good about it just a drag!
'It was so much expected after awesome season 1...but season 2 is just boring and dramatic...'
"'I\'m not sure why the Triple K, the militant creation of the Democrats after the Civil War, is being revived in episode 1 as the racist bad guys, but it\'s difficult to understand Hollywood, these days.Nothing like the movie, and nothing like the graphic novels I enjoy.*Not* Watchmen!'"
"'The first episode of The Night Of is phenomenal, and uncommonly suspenseful; the remaining seven episodes never reach the same level. They are engrossing but slow, more of a docudrama on the American justice system, daily prison life, ethnic prejudices, etc. than the promised murder mystery. The resolution of the whodunit is disappointing, using the classic cheating technique of a previously unseen character who pops out of nowhere and turns out to be the real killer (also: are we supposed to not care what happens to the female lawyer?). The series is extremely well-made and acted, but at Top 156 of all time on IMDb as of this comment, I\'d also have to say slightly overrated. *** out of 4 (first episode only is a ***1/2 out of 4).'"
'Too lengthy and dragged story. Action is good. Thrill is missing. Storyline is flawed.'
"'This is a bad documentary aside from its bias. Its poorly constructed, and lacks a linear narrative when it was surely appropriate. In addition some of the people interviewed were just star struck hangers on. They typically had very little useful information to provide. The one fat football coach had the nerve to say that if Hernandez has access to legal weed, he might not have committed the 3 murders (that we know of).Its fairly obvious that Hernandez was a sociopathic narcissist as well as a ticking time bomb. His murderous nature had nothing to do with adverse environments and events. It seems trite to have to point these things out, but here we go. Many men are closeted homosexuals, many men lose their fathers in their teens, many men have bad parents, but practically zero of these men are murderers.I thought Aaron Hernandez was a human P.O.S. before I wasted three hours on this garbage. My opinion of him only got worse afterward.'"
"'Am from the area in question. The nastiness of the kinfolk is very nearly accurate; in real life they are much more venomous. Good portrayal of southern Missouri, with some flaws. Like, yanking every rock from a creek has nothing to do with superstition; it\'s the kinfolks\' message to the world, the next body we\'uns dump won\'t git hungup in this crick. Stuff like that, an outsider can\'t fathom, but to a child of the kinfolk it would be plain as day. As dark and ugly and ignorant as Missoura.\nI will say one thing for sure, they did not exaggerate how creepy and weird Missouri is. They downplayed it. The people of Missoura are much creepier in real life. Fly over it. Edit: made the mistake of putting the second disk in. OMG the fact that anyone rates this above a 1 signifies everything wrong with humanity. The fact that Jillian Flynn gets published signifies everything wrong with humanity. Intolerably stupid and bad. Just BAD BAD BAD. The menacing satanic ugliness of small town USA should not be glorified like this.'"
"What a depressing cast of characters and story line this was. How the heck did this TV mini-series garner an 8.2 IMDB rating from over 56K IMDB viewers? Surely to God there were not 50,000 plus who worked on delivering this morbid min-series that skewed the undeserved high 8.2 rating were there?Rape, incest and alcoholism all wrapped up in a neat little barf bag called Sharp Objects. Patricia Clarkson's lacklustre performance as the depressed matriarch Adora Crellin, complimented the even worst performance of her estranged daughter Camille Preaker, (lead actress Amy Adams) performance as the helpless victim of an earlier gang rape who comes back home to cover a story for her big city newspaper.This was an overrated TV mini-series and it is the audience that should be outraged not the performers."
'First four episodes were good. Then it starts to drag. I didnt like Kerry Washington as Mia. Too unlikeable and that hairdo and robotic delivery. I thought the most interesting character was Izzy. Reese Witherspoon reprised a similar role from what she had in Big Little Lies. A series of eight episodes but it feels like sixteen. I didnt absorb the subplots and the Chinese actress was god awful. I didnt buy it.'
"Wow Reese Witherspoon did an amazing job in this role!! To be honest, almost all of the actors did. The only one who I had trouble watching was Kerry Washington - why does she always look like she's just stepped in dog poo or about to scream or cry?\nI enjoyed the show, some good drama and a few twists. I didn't love it though, especially the silly ending."
'The first episode is about humans killing a whale or other fisher people to hunt the ocean. How the f is that cool? The whole episode just shows human stupidity and greed. Sucks.'

"'Well, well, well ... what do we have here !!! I do believe Fox is just trying to air anything just to fill the slots in the summer vacation.To be quite fair the pilot wasn\'t that bad yet it wasn\'t really good !! the script was just mediocre even the supposedly thrilling moments weren\'t really jumpy or catchy as they\'re were meant to be, and the the Sci-Fi still not feeling the Wowzer Tech deal to make me engage more that it is really a Sci-Fi.i believe this is the first experience of TV screenplay writing for Max Borenstein and i think he got over-Encouraged to do this after he wrote Godzilla\'s screenplay ,, but i think this was a premature move .As for The Cast,, Stark Sands was just okay his face in feeling fear was fine but other than that it was senseless, Meagan Good is lovely but i think she should be more concerned about the other new show Mr. Robinson and just be more active on it,.. Wilmer Valderrama is okay too.Overall,, the pilot went much lower than i expected and i advise no one to pursue watching this.. Unless ... the script get more excitement.'"
'My Wife & I really looked forward to this special show and were so disappointed. The characters were interesting in the beginning and then mostly not that likable. Plot so far off and jazzed up with low budget special effects from the original story that it was painful to watch at some points. The events in Neverland were so Dark that it was hard to feel good at the end. Poor editing for the TV-Commercial format were like they literally chopped scenes for commercials. The most abrupt ending going to credits and commercials for the next shows not appreciated. SyFy Channel used to do better. Wished we had back the (3)hours of viewing time for something better. Feel sorry for everyone who watched the full 4 hours with commercials.'
"I have somewhat mixed feelings about this show. The first episode was perplexing, throwing a lot of stuff at the viewer with little explanation, but I was impressed by the way it all was made to make sense in the last 10 minutes. Still, I wasn't that interested in watching more and only did so because my girlfriend wanted to.The rest of the series is less fancy in the plotting, telling a fairly straightforward story of how a psychopath gang leader's (a great, disturbing performance by Jeff Daniels) obsessive hunt for a renegade gang member intersects with the lives of a town almost entirely populated by women.The cast is good and the story moves well, although some of it feels extraneous and the last episode is a mess (I describe many of its defects in my user review of that episode, if you're curious).If the finale were better I would give this a 7, but even then the darkness and violence can be a bit much. I wouldn't really recommend it, but my girlfriend would."
"'If you liked the game which has more or less the same title, then please do yourself a favor and never ever watch this.\nIt starts out ok even if Ken\'s obvious wig is distracting to say the least. But it\'s like they ran out of money in the end...... Was there an end? Absolutely unsatisfying. Made no sense at all. And how about the rest of the characters. Were they too expensive?\nSuch a shame they made this wreck. And all the wow this is the best ever idiots should first play the game like I did.\nWaste of time.'"
"'Well, that was disappointing. It started strong with the first few episodes being a rugged western with a feeling of HELL ON WHEELS or maybe FRONTIER. Then they stated in on the town of women who choose to be with each other, don\'t know how GLAAD missed that detail when they were giving the show awards. By the end of the fourth show it had shifted from western to the land of women. There were moments of brilliance with Jeff Daniels playing a truly evil bad guy who quotes scripture in one minute and rapes a mother in front of her family the next. How can you believe in a god who would create us and create a rattlesnake too? How does that work? Interesting stuff. Too bad the agenda took over and steered the whole cattle drive into a ditch.'"
"'The real problem with Hellsing is not the computer animation vs. traditional animation as one person pointed but the lack of gore. The anime has probably a couple of minutes of gore but not that much. The other problem with Hellsing is that a couple of eps move too slow so much in fact that youll fast forward to the action and then rewind to the dialogue.As for the DVD boxed sets every braggs about they aint really nothing. Brief special features only lasting a couple of minutes is not enough for $30 to 50 set. Youd be better download eps of the net for free.Hellsing is good anime just not great. Want great anime see Gungrave available fansubbed only Bomberman, Final Fantasy Unlimited, but Hellsing does have its moments of brillance and eve dark humor like in Episode 2 where an evil vampire gets a blowjob while shooting away at the dead corpses around him.'"
"'Battlestar Galactica: The Resistance is a 2006 mini-series consisting of 10 episodes (5 minutes max, usually shorter) that was made to create a bridge between two seasons of the original series. It runs for roughly the length of a usual episode and features some of the main characters of the show. Thumbs up for that as it\'s not a given. Some shows (Walking Dead, I think) include random mini-series that do not feature any of the main players. The action includes the rise of new life, the death of old life and some moral questions about the connection between arms and holy places. Director Wayne Rose was assistant director on the original series and made a whole bunch of webisodes, also between other seasons. Writer Ronald D. Moore wrote a lot of these too, but also, even better, also some episodes of Battlestar Galactica.My favorite episode is the one where they are mourning for the blonde woman that died. All in all, however, I was not wowed enough so that I would feel a need to watch Battlestar Galactica anytime soon, maybe also because it is not really my genre. It\'s a good watch for huge fans of the show, but not a must-see by any means.'"
"'Defending Jacob, William Landay\'s 2012 based hit novel, is latest Apple TV series which is a slow crime drama. Thanks to the attempts to tell it over eight long episodes, the show feels slow and overstretched. As a result, dramatic tension and mystery elements are diluted, while the script needs more seasoning. Basically, there is a just few details that are explored and miniseries probably could have been just 90-120 minutes film. Ultimately, it is not the hit that Apple TV+ needs to be able to compete with major streaming services like Netflix.Rating: 6-/5+'"
